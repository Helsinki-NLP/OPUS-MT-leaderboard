Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian light at the village parking lot was put into operation - in sight of the older town hall lamp.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or strike?
Gutach's mayor answered that question clearly yesterday.
"The Rathausampel was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights are safe for cyclists as well as bus passengers and the inhabitants of Bergle.
The plant officially put into operation yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"In terms of the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to come to their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg District Council.
"According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles run through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a roundabout was also planned, but because of the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was discarded again.
According to Arnold, everything was tested at the location of the traffic lights before: "With the help of a transporter loaded with particularly long logs, we tested whether these vehicles can travel from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending the traffic lights."
The approximately 15 000 euro traffic light system itself is the "modernest thing on the market," explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which shine so strongly that the lights of the drivers can be easily seen, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"If a group or disabled people walk across the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone comes safely across the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver had to think about it as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: the traffic lights for pedestrians were barely green, an upper class vehicle rushed through - with bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth about the soul.
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency to raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher therefore compiles a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz.
For example, the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibbeigen" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
The eight-member ensemble hangs through the textual material on the largely empty stage - an important prop: a snatched sofa, on which the interpretation is copied and masturbated.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance conjures up the template with a wealth of directorial ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic realizations.
They are touched hard, dipped under water with their heads, battered against the wall with their evening robes.
Pushed into cellophane or bodice, they stoke on dangerously high stumps through the staging, either monologize loudly or lie completely silently on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this effort.
The evening has the best moments when singing - the range ranges from deep purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come to rest, and Winkler's absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of any car.
The devices that record every kilometer driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the miles driven – and possibly also where they were driven – and then using the information to calculate tax rulings.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we're only likely to use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles we've driven with all Californian drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the taxes paid by Americans at the pump, is bankrupt.
But America is not as much fuel as it used to be.
Cars consume less fuel.
The State mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased in 20 years.
At high fuel prices, politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legally-established climate change goals.
But the Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also impressed by the idea of letting drivers pay after a distance.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers, who in a report in 2011 had called on Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance, responding to the concerns of rural MPs who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
However, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
Oregon is the country's most committed driver, who currently recruits 5,000 riders for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue any of their movements.
"Thinking about Big Brother and such things was a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Nevada Department of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into full - grown surveillance devices. "
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can use to capture the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
This, according to Khan, would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not compete to help states tax drivers.
Rather, their aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of the miles driven.
However, the devices it tests are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average miles driven by all the residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax-based device that can also pay parking fees, pay insurance only for miles driven, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time that will allow drivers to avoid traffic jams.
"Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners wonder, however, whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion.
In the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials declared that Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little fuel, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
When we do, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats well
The volunteer fire brigade mastered its autumn main test despite staff shortages with flying colors.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Division commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder estate in Burgberger Straße in his acceptance of the practice.
A short circuit is said to have been created there during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two breathing protectors of the Wehr made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time, they managed to find the first person and lead him outside.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was carried out via an overfloor hydrant at a distance of about 100 metres.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what to do with little staff available.
In the event of an emergency, support will be provided by the day intervention group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, the President of the Landtag Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow came from.
In the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, he worked together with the executive heads of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the parents' council chairmen on this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum.
He also praised family friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were caring for and caring for their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to the termination of the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"If you have already learned the advantages of the region during your studies, your acquired knowledge and skills often retain the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," the President of the Landtag was convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made for the expansion of local public transport.
"Stay persistent and make sure that public transport gets better," he explained to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the seniors to coffee, cakes and then a Vesper.
Formerly, the elderly fellow citizens were entertained in the rest area.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained popular melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as a frontal delimitation of the old schoolyard in front of the renovation to Kirchstraße is to be set again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was installed during the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard, for the stabilization and static relief of the over one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt (Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt), the state monument office is included in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation will be carried out by experts, who will then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary to renovate the wall from the ground up as a follow-up measure and to place it on a new base.
The historical, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since no drainage is available, need renovation and has a bow tilt forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones indicate damage to the weather, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures caused a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for film recordings, will be spoken by the Landesdenkmalamt.
Should specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the conservationists.
The students of the Bräunlingen primary school, who are now again taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now also taken part in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," said Özdemir to the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who is regarded in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this pushes for a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, jazz and pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to the U.S. customs authorities, the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
According to information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar," said the U.S. Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped so that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters down to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine found.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the seized marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego continued.
However, it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation agency in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the US.
No details were given about the arrests, at least one of them being Mexicans, they said.
You'll have to expect up to ten years in prison.
2014 will be Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250th anniversary.
Return of the first documentary mention is drawing ever closer.
When the year comes to an end in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming to an end.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned in 794 together.
In churches a document was produced, in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in church houses.
Kirchen-Hausen will be 1250 in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On June 21st, together with the Sunday celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on July 12th in the arena with fireworks and on December 13th as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This is completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle will also be published on the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary.
"However, a chronicle is to be written not only by Geisingen itself, but also a printed work on today's Geisingen, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's Geisingen is also celebrating its 2014 birthday, and in 1974 the present-day space with the incorporations was completed.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The fool guild Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony of Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has a banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this during the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a document of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which at that time was court square.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014 is also 40 years ago.
Council targets track installations
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councillors have decided.
Schiltach has to pay 220 000 euros for this.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they have to take part in the costs with a third, the rest are shared by the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's master builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the peculiarities of the "Am Hirschen" crossing.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
There, larger vehicles, such as those that transport lumber, could also be on the other side of the road without having to block the tracks.
Großhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp, in his statement, summed up the critics' mood: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long timber transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberles bridge, because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, Haas argued that the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed.
As it is to be expected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to examine the costs of the proposed widening of the road.
Despite this, the majority of the changes to the railway crossing were agreed on the condition that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" if necessary for meeting traffic to about 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had examined the railway's conversion plans by the engineering office Breinlinger, because she had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was possible.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the inclination ratios of the road could lead to longer vehicles being seated.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility for this as a road load carrier.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Haas argued that since both the removal of wood and the turning of wood were working in the current condition of construction, it should not be agreed with the conversion of the level crossing.
At this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is also significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because right next to it is the stop centre with a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point to such an extent that no collision would threaten.
The majority of people refused to approve the renovation of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach had to "bade" the problem with seated vehicles, according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
As unproblematic, the panel considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Far-off planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Faraway worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets on other stars.
No one knows if there are lives on at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earthlike planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are being asked by those in charge of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make research a decisive step forward.
The budget for such "L missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were under discussion, five of which have now come into the short term.
Many committees examine the proposals, check out the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
The Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, initiated in 2007, will find answers.
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our near surroundings will be examined in more detail.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered as an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to shed light on what conditions exist for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system.
In our solar system these processes can be investigated exemplary.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe will start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be combined.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, which consists of stars, planets and living beings like us, there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already granted an M mission here, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and thus enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best chances for an L-mission are "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
By this, physicists mean changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves created during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four more proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
Among other things, proposals for the re-transport of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics have already been eliminated.
Snowden ready to "co-operate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence agency, has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify to the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, the latter writes: "Even though the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy in charge of the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that one should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US".
Ströbele, a Green MP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele stated that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden says in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, said the MP.
Snowden explains in his letter that he would be exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had driven him out of his home country.
However, he was touched by the global response to "my act of political expression. "
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to US$100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for one piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers should keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said that 25 US dollars were calculated when the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who only paid at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the fee of $100 is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines began to charge fees for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible in hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee wasn't really about making money.
It was about Frontier's most loyal customers, who had made it clear that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at Frontier's boarding gate may be allowed to take a piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar piece of luggage.
O'Malley stated that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they came to the gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will only enter into force in the summer, and there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often scold about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transport of luggage should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, so far leave the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge hand luggage fees three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner, followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the Spirit hand baggage fee would bring 50 million US dollars a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand baggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I've experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing my teeth and hands-on discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding was running as if it were lubricated."
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and replenish coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had moved in.
Frontier's step to charge for hand baggage if passengers do not purchase directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than via an online travel agency.
Frontier has, however, gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were once again reduced to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight trip with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third party therefore only brings customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity decreased by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the company's sale.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women attended the last breakfast of this year in the Protestant church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house were "words from the Bible" and "reverses from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, responded to the biblical proverbs in a lecture after breakfast.
"Speaking words contain wisdom, prescriptions, or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
She called sayings like, "Let the eye of wood be watchful, as the scales fall from the eyes, and let an eye be cast on a man, and the Lord gives him in his sleep, and wash his hands in innocence."
Several times the speaker also advised her listeners what the saying was.
The church councillor Christel Dehner took care of the phrases from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, making blue, beating something up.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges into the past".
Finally, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round also the mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is launched today at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry will be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
"It's new that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits were manifold: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would have trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA declares that an "internal error" and not hackers are responsible for the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a mistake has paralyzed their public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a scheduled update," the espionage agency explained in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that this is still not available for some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesman had told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "in no way compromised."
According to the spokesman, secret information is not in danger.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and, after the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad, is exposed to sharp criticism – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over intelligence fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and better than in September, "we had hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the employment agency in Sonthofen.
Many companies have reacted with restraint in recruitment so far.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the trade, health care and care of the elderly".
Since September, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been available since the season.
The winter season starts there in mid-December.
The whole background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Profit losses on Bombardier after decline in delivery figures and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after falling back on orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
To date, only three more take-offs followed the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
Results fell short of forecasts and led to a price drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its valuation from "outperform" to "sector performance" on Thursday in view of the limited price potential of the share in the next one to two quarters.
"Even though weaker delivery figures for aircraft were expected to be as far as possible, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft line can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, binding orders for the CSeries have so far been moderate at 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet airliner are true.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, corporate management also assured analysts and media that the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's service life.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, and the rest shortly thereafter, it was said by the company.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical as to whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer can commission a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said it was reviewing the commissioning plan (EIS) and would update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share from 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share the previous year.
The adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales decreased slightly and dropped from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenues of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer states that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Orders in the aerospace sector amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were within our scope, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment have increased by just under eleven percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transport division was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September, slightly higher than on 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In midday trading on Thursday, Bombardier's share declined by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google's Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will change to the Board of Directors.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport administration told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard had also been killed.
The media also reported several casualties.
US President Barack Obama is constantly being informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses reported having seen a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveller told CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travellers would have screamed and children would have cried.
Panic broke out among those waiting, many hiding behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA had suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television pictures, there were numerous ambulances and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building to safety.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a Special Operations Command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management reported via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, formed long backlogs.
With the exception of landings, air traffic was temporarily stopped.
However, several aircraft were also observed on CNN during take-off.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officers watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the attorney's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar with colleagues at a dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta used class A drugs on a regular basis after traces of cocaine were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards during tests.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted cocaine possession in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out during their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash can.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park for dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was announced that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs of class A in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to the "lawyer secret."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he operated an office under his private address as well as at work and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called important actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after important arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law. "
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted as far as possible against the police investigation, so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus discredited his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta rejected any misconduct and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but would do it immediately. "
But after the hearing, superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: "Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals. "
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and odds inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which captivated the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary Mass will be held from 19 during the evening Mass at St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at the divine service at St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The fair is performed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Scepticism is increasing in confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, fundamental changes will be made in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing to change about the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new one is hesitant but increasingly giving way to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the main officials of the pastoral care team were held.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt presented the revised guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
In the future, the SE Haslach as a parish will form a body of public law, which enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual parishes so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the Reverend Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members of each parish are to be represented, in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed locally.
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide for accumulated funds to be retained in the parishes for special purpose.
On the other hand, liabilities are transferred to the whole municipality.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which all parishes then meet, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone were invested in," relativized Haslach's chairman of the parish council Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the committee in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had set themselves the task of "becoming one, stay five" and had to realize that this is not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral unit then began to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparation will be made more concrete in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity is more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorfer family will incur an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is fixed every year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These relate to the additional costs incurred by them in the energy transition, which they can charge through a levy on the price of electricity.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf are the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform its customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the figure more close to 2 cents.
Traffic light on permanent red: Watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the sign of light is defective.
Then what should you do - drive with red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free, he can continue driving, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period had to be "reasonable", which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before starting a malfunction of the traffic light.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that he bears the full blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who endure less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and refer to a decision of the Upper Regional Court Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light breach.
The traffic light was not defective, but moved to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Community Council is pleased about solid household
Every time municipal council meetings are about the household, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal bakery in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration no longer knows debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recognised as a full success in this respect.
This became clear at the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros exceeded the planned figure.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about one million euros higher than the approach, with some 1.8 million euros.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipality's share of income tax.
The asset balance was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investment than planned has been made in the 2012 financial year, the provision of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the councillors were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dear.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to dispense with high lifting rates in the past.
According to Gerster, however, this in turn has often reduced subsidies from the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory stocks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for subsidies must have certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investments are due in the coming years for which we would like to have subsidies," announced Gerster in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honoured.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which is probably more than loved by now.
Wermter was also active in the club, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst, as the choir is also a church choir.
His singer colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honour, the 31st Autumn Festival was held in the usual lanes: with the MGV Betra, the Salzstetten Liederkranz, the singers department Baisingen and the local music association, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mixture of different choirs and vocal styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, you brothers".
To honour their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small volume - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you go through the valley".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and women's group - the "Impulschor" - provided for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir with the Neapolitan people "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus took to foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer's department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papart's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical graduation.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which the children occupied the lunch well.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centers in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
The Schwarzwälder Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, would like to support the institutions in the realization of their building and beautification wishes.
Does kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centres and crèches from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a building or beautification wish for your facility, you can apply with this at the Schwarzwälder messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten building site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the requirements for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide for many diligent construction workers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
With the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb, Bauhaus provides the material.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and should then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law
"We are in a terrifying situation and one may wonder: What does Parliament prevent us from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was read in the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government is "effectively strangling the media " by means of the new law, while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered "a heavy blow, " calling the draft "draconic. "
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the authorities' anger because they published footage of security cameras showing how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxury mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate him, even though the summons was withdrawn after the media shouted out.
Under the new law, media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "a single penalty can bankrupt most radio stations. "
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "lively blogosphere" in their description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a national journalist who describes Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"If politicians leave themselves, they will lead the country into bankruptcy and we will return to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already attracted public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reinstated their strong salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field did not lose any of its importance for the city and the football club.
It seems that everyone had wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason had a look.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as for some speakers.
That's why the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, was also wet.
His thanks went to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association, who contributed.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The well-equipped pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
Karl Rombach, Member of the Parliament of the Federal Parliament, also praised this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Further greetings spoke for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn caused the original lawn so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first reflections on the solution of the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the real school on the Salinensee was considered.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up about the creation of an artificial turf sports field, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were made two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erblascht, agreed to a cost contribution of 100 000 euros for the construction of the square and approved the country's funding of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 to the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarizing Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 by 108 metre artificial turf site began on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used to create a dirt bike track.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of home affairs and justice.
In addition, the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, deputies' bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, this should be about dual citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the pressure for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flatrate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive", said the SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his faction.
There was a threat of alternative traffic on rural roads, which are already the focus of accidents.
Moreover, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step from Pronold's point of view.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was actually not the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.

Drivers seriously injured in an accident
In the event of an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old passenger car driver from Aachen has been seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempener outer ring towards Grefrath around 9.15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the 37-year-old's car.
The driving fence collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Konstanz: Locking after accident at Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of the city on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left-hand side lane in the direction of Stroseyersdorfstraße and changed to the right-hand lane.
The collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer took place there.
The VW Passat from a 19-year-old behind the BMW was also damaged.
A total of about 15,000 damage was reported by the police.
The road had to be closed during the accident, it was said.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no announcements like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements thus falls away - the noise level should be reduced significantly.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers sound on one day - it is to be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information on changed boarding or departure times is also a bit lost here," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to pulling the brake cart with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are Swabian-flavored on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and lone fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The trunk is long and weighs between 25 and 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter what the distance," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown vertically, should be overturned once and then just come to the couch.
This is rated with the most points.
When throwing horseshoes, it depends on the accuracy of the target.
From eight meters away, a stake is thrown.
The participants must demonstrate skill and strength when carrying water buckets over 50 metres.
Time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
You can train from 10 o'clock.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Scots Skirt.
But also Swabian costume is allowed.
For the "Outfit" the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is already announced on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening the brass music friends get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m., the biraböhmische brass music from Schömberg creates the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays brisk polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron from Weilen, will be part of the tour.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fool guild.
On Sunday the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for early shooting, from 2 p.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the festival.
The start is already on Friday the Stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf.
Other program items include the old-timer and tractor meeting, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry on Saturday and Sunday.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the Crafts Market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, Strohhhüpfburg, tractor driving (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of dairy and egg alternatives
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quark substitute.
The Federation of Vegetarians mentions others for World Vegan Day on November 1st.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, and yoghurt is replaced by soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Strikable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a crushed, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple sauce or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable.
Loosen doughs instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can also serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people currently feed vegan, i.e. purely vegetable, in Germany.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, where the heart of Manhattan was reached on foot.
Here was a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city doesn't sleep", the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then we went over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11th.
On the third day, students from the 373-metre high viewing platform of Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city and enjoy the view.
Then we went through the hectic bustle of New York's streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was, according to legend, a quite ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe der Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on Parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The winders wear riding clothes because they accompany mainly riders, horses and dog pack musically on towing hunts.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new café.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to the lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling that it has experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to remain the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the café with its beautiful name has exactly that to the goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but also tangible and recurring experience.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team spoils the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually stocked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, already made a name for themselves as gourmets before the opening of the chic café at Opschlag: In Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"We don't have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here would like to address young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple is behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoys the fragrant hot brew in various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of an expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," the NRZ reveals.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better put, one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner isn't a big fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right."
And with an event, I only talk to those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
Let's say Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival that the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club restaurant of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the right celebration to perform honours.
This time secretary Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You not only wrote a lot for us, but also made some rounds for us, but also our warm thanks," said Erich Schlotmann, chairman of the choir.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of a bunch of activities went this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
==References====External links==
A special thank you was given by the board to the team of Vereinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribert, who once again conjured up a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choir rehearsals on Tuesdays at 7:45 p.m.
"New singing-joyed voices are always welcome", says Schlotmann.
UN announces new poverty reduction targets
As of now, the United Nations is starting to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing "sustainable development goals" to replace the 2015 MDGs.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, the handball top team still has a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated in this matter.
Still, I hope we finally win again.
"Because I don't even know how such a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-liga reserve from Fredenbeck hasn't torn out trees yet, Malmon raises the index finger warningly in advance.
Many players I have still trained myself in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait and see if there is any reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Above all in the cover work and during the switch-over game it had a huge hap.
The use of opportunities must also definitely be improved.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to appeal to peace calls during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the Independence Square of the capital.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by the White-ruled Rhodesia and later the South African apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could in the next few years bring investment of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA to the country.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, told Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
To AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who "want to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions that have been fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a grievous movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former member of Renamo, will probably improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made troublesome attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, where Beira is located, which uses the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga was reluctant to answer the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country's future and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable streets again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life," says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrated how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "far too wild, too offensive and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught at schools", which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" of works of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who are "excessively didactic" would "completely shut down" children, for in entertaining stories the messages would be conveyed" subliminally. "
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scene play.
From arrival to the awarding of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and bridged time leaps from youth to imminent retirement.
On 22 October 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his children's heaven, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as the city's great son.
Stilecht he drove with the Zweispänner and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received by the audience with a lot of applause, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann was incredibly well versed in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance.
Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honour of awarding the honorary citizenship, which, together with a part of the city council, was waiting for him on behalf of the then incumbent Hättich.
Their expectation was then made by the Dreikönigsinger, which led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Oh how beautiful, youth memories of my own Dreikönigenzeit come to life again".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Out, Out".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the Heimaterde, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene play.
There was much applause and many praiseworthy words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants grows
The chances of remaining in the league of the sports downhill Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project dispenses with an application for a possible return seat.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first breath from Ludwigsburg, however, could not be heard.
"We didn't deal with the wildcard procedure until it was clear that Düsseldorf would not be licensed," said Alexander Reil, Neckar Riesen boss of our newspaper.
Until May 23rd, starter Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic suitability in the Bundesliga.
Until now, however, the Rheinlanders have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The Church of the Lord's Supper
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the cultural and tourism office of the city dedicates the last of its public theme tours on Sunday, 27 October, to the Lord's Supper Church.
After the visit of the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerlocher period after 1850 was to be considered when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning final point is a visit to the Lord's Supper Church.
There the leaders get the story of the construction of the church told and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the painting of the Lord's Supper, created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the andert half-hour guided tour is at the Atomkeller Museum at 3pm.
Maps are available at the Atomkellermuseum's cash register.
For questions and information the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spy case in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency on the basis of unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved in the inter-state context, it said.
A departure of Snowden from Russia is practically impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, Snowden threatened the extradition there, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the winning title in the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team, each playing against each other.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were equal to Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze podium.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful end of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in children's hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program for a colourful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, the right thing is for every age.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop also works.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or gyro, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow races or stilt runs, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 2 p.m.
On an off-road tour, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or yet lie.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward on Sunday to the clown Otsch, who drives his cockroach from 11 o'clock with the museum guests.
Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner is comfortable and fairytale-like.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 am to 5 pm, numerous craftsmen such as the broombinder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be looked over the shoulder in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday program.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovable cow because he intends to participate in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt can't be distracted from his dream despite a heart defect.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the movie there is coffee, tea and cake.
Shrill beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the dump.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage place in front of the dike.
Two huge blue dumps and recharging devices distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the transshipment equipment moves, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with unfavorable wind, this is widely heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now time to keep the warning signals quiet with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to rely on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Niedersachsenbrücke, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the sunbathing tub in front of the terminal, which is lowered to 18.5 meters, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can be handled here for a long time.
"This year, we want to crack the 3-million-ton mark on the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the imported coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant were still connected to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning the best team in Europe over the past two years," said Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
At first, the guests managed to transform a 15-point backlog 13 minutes before the end into a lead before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again," said Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: just under a hundred years ago, the varietal artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as it was most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Caroline's stand-up institution, this year's festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and became more and more successful until they became too familiar to perform in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The world of comedy has also grown with the festival.
A number of comedians participating in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional paths, such as programmes on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slipping fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on "Saturday Night Live" as well as on "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell, focused on racial issues) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a TV show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of the last few years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides would come to a solution at the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Killing Game Comrades with Machete
Two children have admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victim to go hunting birds with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body in a well, reports the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
After that, they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half - sister of the younger woman who took her with her was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the crime before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other reasons, the elder named a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric juvenile institution.
Pimps must go to prison
Due to exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a trial.
In five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the streets after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the earnings of the women, who partly bought for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermined women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he suffered severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion.
The 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession after a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus a limited capacity for guilt.
The court did not have to hear any more of the injured women.
According to a KRIPO official, after a first announcement, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be detected by telephone surveillance measures.
The intercepted talks were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in whom one of the women had found bruises all over her body, has not made any statement to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality" that sees violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has detached himself from these circles and wants to live a normal life after the detention," he said.
Oil price continues to decline to USD 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil grade for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel in Europe in the late morning in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was evidence of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, with growth rising to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching the lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by US refineries, fell by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy
On Thursday, a federal court in the U.S. blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program ("stop-and-search") and released the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheldlin were suspended until an appeal of the city was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was violating the Constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and the corresponding training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the code of conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program in an inappropriate way.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program with body-carried cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics were criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of office of the non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities filed a lawsuit, which became a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, and influence the way other police officers use the scheme.
Opponents are of the opinion that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; that money would also be wasted and that the broader problem of a police force that was under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade would not be solved.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented the controls.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only manages to reach dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the interventions were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
This is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Henne, to work with the association in an advisory capacity.
In 2008, Schleeh carpentry from Baiersbronn created the Sick Bay in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just under a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, says Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, one could not make as many trips as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to hospit here in various areas.
In addition, containers of material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling about Mercedes vehicles converted to a mobile goat stable from Mauritania and by describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation he named his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of Parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and chased them, but Coulson also called them and left messages, as the court learned.
"According to the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is no one standing in front of people's homes hoping to catch them in a fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW used three methods to investigatively research stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, it can't be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say: "If he knew about it. "
Rumors about Clarke's affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editor when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time of the research, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about. "
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Blunkett for an affair with a married woman when he himself had a relationship with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3rd, 2000 and August 9th, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reichensteuer, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without result.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande welcomed members of the association and association representatives at the Élysée-Palast in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on incomes of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced at the end of November will now also be carried out, the head association of the professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, informed.
The games in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are therefore cancelled.
Sinking: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning process", opened Mayor Jens Häußler the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to have the planned measures explained, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council".
According to Häußler, the flood, which hit Gechgen unprepared on 15 May 2009, was a major event that raised the question of protection measures for the future.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighboring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many cultivated land as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
The planning of the protection against a flood, according to the German Weather Service, is based statistically every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles, this is called "HQ 100aClimate".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in 2009 in Gechingen, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aClimate, around four million euros have to be invested in Gechgen, whereby the municipality can expect regional subsidies of around 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that funding only existed if an overall approach was implemented.
For this purpose, the municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the tributary of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Tal.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired overall goal.
In addition, the most economical solution was to be found, says Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was displeasure with residents of the old town, who have to suffer again and again, even in normal thunderstorms, from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is well known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the directives for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be tolerated.
To scale the sewers larger would devour millions.
Severely injured after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately completely blocked the road, but could say little about the accident at first.
However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, with the woman so badly trapped that it took the fire brigade less than half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both victims came to nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, and his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazingly the kinship in the outside: the stabbing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security madness and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John's revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugged his brain.
He got it, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates from 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is like ours, mutants are looking into the future - and the police are reaching out.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the agency.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a penal camp full of pesudover criminals."
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into action.
Dick's story looks like the blueprint for the NSA's anti-terror laws and listening rush.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself will be monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system's freaking out.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own requirements.
Not only do you buy mistakes and sacrifices, but you build on them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Spokesman's affair about Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spying arm around Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, reported the agency Interfax.
Previously, Green MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations strengthen company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the request of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German internal intelligence service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, BAT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of views between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use opportunities of foreign espionage "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profits."
But ever since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, started publishing his corneal to US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director's word.
Reports of the American National Security Agency spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtaining data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company's paranoia to a new high level due to state surveillance.
The barrel overflowing caused the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, corporate management is certainly also a potential target.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence to date that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag, it was suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the jurisdiction there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, according to the revelations about US data mining activities with Prism, some ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they stay physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place.
That's always been the case.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of BASF.
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business management does not usually boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that gives advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the Board of Directors of Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access," warns BAT in a report.
The US warns its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second behind China in the US National Intelligence Estimate, which used hacking economic data.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even when working together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony succeeds, gave now a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers around a wedding were represented.
A trend: The retro look has come back into being.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is a must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the clothes, which are often wet and embroidered, are closed, often with a veil, but at the back, they go down their backs and often end up in a train.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidermüller, the spirits are separated.
In men the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be chosen cream-coloured or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the restaurant, was explained.
Jewelryless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
If you want to advance with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for him.
"But carriages are also popular for juniper parties," he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
The "After Wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - in other words, recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothing, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Floral arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.
Dog friends successful
For the time being, the athletes of dog friends Bitz were successful in a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15 month old Marley he took it with 87 points to twelfth place.
Susi Höpp, with her woody in class 1, faced the critical gaze of the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up ringer mat in the gym in his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the lawyer told the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium.
The sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubted.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
You never thought he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that any logic is contrary to the laws of physics as well as to common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they were convinced that the truth was covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important issues remain unsolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of "position - related suffocation. "
A second autopsy, however, resulted in another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would commission the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Department was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all the surveillance videos that the investigators checked.
The teenager's parents said that they hoped that the video recordings contained clues as to how he died.
CDC Publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with children's food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government, as the number of school children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff, and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen auto-injection is most commonly used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue, "" My tongue feels as if there is a hair on it, " or "My tongue is tingling. "
Parents of intersexual children can choose "gender indefinitely "
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognized for children born with inconclusive genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can indicate "undefined " or" not specified " on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for sex assignment in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person said years later: "I am neither husband nor wife. "
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and scarred.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children are born every year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (eggs or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available gender identification information if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding – if at all – for surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds after a good cause. "
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
One could make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but because of their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender people face in working life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who are not in line with the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court had granted life-long retention of "unspecified" sex status.
German ID cards will have a third assignment in addition to M and W, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, stating: "If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we twist two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that it would be better for babies to be assigned a gender at birth.
"Being a parent is stressful enough without any further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered sex to be something that could be eradicated and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are questioned, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a 'psychiatric emergency'," said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with inconclusive genitals is based on Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses – how parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person views himself as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
But at 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990 ' s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public, who are "not happy with the result. "
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life " as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he was supposed to have a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The surgery has made him barren.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘undefined' to the child," she explained.
We fear that this favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said their organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a struggle to force young children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Katie is now 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the children's psychiatry.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make decisions in haste," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write "male " or" female. "
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy your parents' happiness.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that's wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknown hurt girls by shot from car
Unknown people injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shooting from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin with an air-pressure weapon.
That's what the police told me in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left calf.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot a bus stop.
A slice broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police are investigating, it was called Friday.
Until the present time, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to throw eggs at children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains immediately, no damage to the property should have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvesterbollers were probably ignited in the city area, but also here no material damage occurred.
A local resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found all his wheel petal blinds in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to take any further action.
Living with a future perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives dreamlike.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
To the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider at the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern that in old age the many steps to the house and the apartment can no longer be managed, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty-year-old has had to experience what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently a book by her has appeared on the topic 'Happy Living in Old Age - Which type of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't work at all in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today, at the age of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the subject of 'living in old age' at all.
Most people push it as long as they can.
Only the others are getting old,' she says, smiling.
It is only when the pressure of suffering is really great that you think about it.
'But then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 residential models for self-determined living in old age.
'But what type of housing you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
There was no solution for age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also become ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the local language, one can also unite in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist author of the book Aussiedlungswilligen to consider.
Among their models are classic caring models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner's WG.
When you're old, everyone's got their Ticks and Macks
'For me, a shared apartment would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Especially not like in a student flat with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'When you're old, you just need your retreat rooms,' says Ries.
Nevertheless, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior resident community can still work.
But this had to go differently than in the classical student World Cup.
And sometimes you just want your peace,' she believes.
With this opinion, at least in the state capital, it does not stand alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as they can', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the citizen service Life in the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people on the subject of 'becoming older'.
For this reason, elderly people in particular would often also accept inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends to all who are concerned with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or their apartment, first to inform themselves thoroughly and not to commission the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer explains.
But the existing apartment can not always be adapted to the age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.
She'll keep looking until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more afraid than in front of the spider at her apartment door.
USA to continue prosecuting Snowden
The US has not changed its position on former US intelligence employee Edward Snowden.
He was still accused of having passed on secret information illegally.
Therefore, he had to face criminal proceedings in the US, said the spokesman for the US State Department, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even Snowden's recent statements would not change that.
The German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had previously appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to further threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's statements were those of a parliamentarian rather than those of a German member of the government.
Secret Service Explorer Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
At first, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
The former NSA employee sought by the USA made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
After a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the responsible persons
I've been asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously employed by the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my work in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is accountable to no one as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while the risks assumed have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a breach of loyalty and strives to criminalize and prosecute political opinions.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this negative stance.
I hope that, when the difficulties in this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate adequately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," emphasizes Maier.
The budget was EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, as heating, looking for the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereienbach gives a place concert on the terrace of Gasthaus Hammer.
As conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the baton at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
President Manuela Honeck presented the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully overcome the first musician's shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin's and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and on Thursday night, it reported that the president's top advisors had conducted "extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's dwindling hope of re-election would look better if he dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Policy Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of the campaign's and the White House's leaders, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the poll readings of former Secretary of State Clinton's exchange with the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisors – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisors, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite their "close, personal relationship" before they finally decided against such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government was actually considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I have said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president at that time had terrible polls, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley described the investigations as "required care," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move would pay off with regard to the ballot boxes.
"Campaigns don't spend that much money on surveys and focus groups unless you seriously think about something," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was "conscious," the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Has the design of the Internet service e-mail been technically implemented in a similar way to traditional mail?
In the design of the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
For this reason, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account in creating a stable foundation for a reliable exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
In the first step, Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
In the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the e-mails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an e-mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails.
There are also possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading along?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against read along.
With great technical effort, it is also possible to cover up the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to easily recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had fallen last, GMail from Google was able to increase significantly.
Mother buried in the forest and pension collected
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.
In order to continue to collect pension and care money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
First he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, then he had spent more than a year and a half on the money.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
Thus, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: at that time it was noticed that the mother in need of care no longer needed any medicine.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had recently cared for it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy did not reveal any evidence of a capital crime.
Want some ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a glowing treat.
The idea came to him after reading a research on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue during consumption, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH increases and the ice glows.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious for that.
Charlie's experimental Bristol-based company is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: "I want to develop an invisible ice cream. "
This is impossible in itself because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
After six days of playing, the TSV Morsum is still in the handball league without any point.
For the team of Ingo Ehlers, it will be the Derby against the TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope that we finally have our heads clear," Ehlers says with a behaving optimistically.
He finally has his full squad at his disposal, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden, like us, is also betting on tempo play.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left everything but a certain impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite, because in derby everything can happen.
However, Panitz now wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
The A-Youth Joost Windßuß, who is active with double rights with the A-Youth-Bundesligaten HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, stay at home.
Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more of a Halloween muffler.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I do not think I will do so this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep on Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween after all is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, irritating inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we're not squeaky.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the US Department of Commerce's 41 million people who run through the neighborhood with the slogan "sweet or saure."
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let's not fool ourselves – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in proceeds, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos where you pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you can't get rid of them again, and then the guy you're standing on leaves a comment like "nice face. "
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something that we made from a small age.
Fortunately, the "baby in pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, says the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you really want to score, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Wohnungsbrand in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces recover charred corpse
The fire brigade had to move out late Thursday evening in Helmbrechts.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
The rescue forces are bringing a charred body out of the house.
Rescue forces found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman explained.
The building was no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030, according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine itself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor on a full job for the first time to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfia takes this back to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly more is being paid in the free economy, but theologians have a secure employer for that.
This came to meet the young people of today who are not only concerned with careers but also with meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point gurte as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with supervision of Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for suspense and adventure, as well as for an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fireman called to rescue a doggy who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock ledge in a quarry
Cockerspaniel-dog Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her predicament
Firefighters roped to rock face and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stuck in a rock wall on a 15 - meter - high lead.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published calls for help on social networks when she escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker carrying out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station hurried to the spot and roped off to rescue Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move any muscle during her rescue – she was frozen like stiff.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog pies.
That was a rather unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky. "
There was a possibility that she was severely injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was scary to watch the rescue. "
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her in her arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had grown too much and it had collapsed, it would have probably crashed.
The firemen have done a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up. "
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker, and that "he hit me when I was 18. "
She added: "That was a long time ago and he was very kind to me. "
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever attempted to approach Katy Perry. "
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else. "
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on this year's Rolling Stones Tour.
Her new album "Prism" immediately landed at number one this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling Gives Scots the Choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed - wire border along the Hadrian Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this did not matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often adjust their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance with Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has come so far that it is already like a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European whistle?
Why trade the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, which was drawn up after the war, has been stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Throughout the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the Bundestag election in September, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket, in which the national economy is forced to stick to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to leave.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared with Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – inspired by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for gas compared with the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage fixings in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is coming up, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be kept in check and Paris at eye level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, with which the weak French economy has to struggle.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-hostile National Front has just won a decisive by-election, bringing the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the "Europe of the (Sovereign) nations" that favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (finally) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which also includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect Scotland could go quite well in a looser European network, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib coalition had to answer for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only in order to get a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing up faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white agemates, as studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the pediatrics association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents – normally this is no indication that puberty is coming quickly," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, pubic hair, armpit hair and body odor, are evident in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first menopause) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it will take at least two to three years to reach Menarche," said Kaplowwitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem".
Time is the most accurate test of puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is "floating" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before eight years of age.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
If progress is made faster, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist, so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstruation and to defend against another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their agemates. "
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter had her days when she was ten.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys come into puberty similar to girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls between the ages of six and nine, which links body fat to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white agemates.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although boys' facial and pubic hairs have grown earlier, the trend towards full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders
Leading aircraft manufacturers have come to an argument about the breadth of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, which is the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width that passengers are offered on long tourist-class flights – not always those that airlines are most concerned with, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American arch rival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results that the new "mini jumbo" design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernised 777X accommodates 406 people with seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18-inch seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often hand over technical details by advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people squeezing together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turboprops," says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy.
People are getting fatter in the face of changing eating habits, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American has increased by ten percent between the ages of 40 and 49, according to the US Department of Health data.
According to US health statistics, the waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations were carried out that showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus' figures on seat dimensions and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
Passengers are more free of elbows, but for manufacturers it will increasingly be an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results partly depend on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive as our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers chose to narrow down, which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares.
"Eightteen inches of seating width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin equipment, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry tape measure to measure the equipment in competition.
Even if they charge for comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but according to its own statement has not sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats at the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to blow away, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking go away
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before tests on humans, more trials are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, whereby a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a "time-out", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he is quite sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, though, smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer enjoy the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to stop the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned at the same time that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former minister of the laboratory party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state's corruption inspectorate.
The former NSW Minister denies that he has changed the rules on the lease of maritime life at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
Now they're investigating the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the properties after Tripodi's former deputy staffwoman Lynne Ashpole testified on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for leases.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which earned the Obeids 2.5 million dollars annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally opted for public tenders.
However, he denied that he had made the changes at Obeid's request, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reshaping of the government's lease arrangements.
A telephone record submitted to the ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
"Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial lease arrangements?", asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheaty Tripodi.
"No," replied Tripodi.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighters attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on rocket shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "realness test"
The government is considering an "reality test" for foreign workers with 457 visas in the context of expanded measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government proposal for discussion was published after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by Australia's neighbours.
"Sudden statements such as 'foreigners should stand in the back' and 'Australians first set up' are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions demanded a sheltered labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some people in the region took an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was visiting Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while others are still being considered.
If the ‘reality criterion' is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be checked to see whether ‘the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or is personally related'.
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after hundreds of companies, which initially only wanted to support a small number of workers, were finally shut down.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat.
The troubled nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections be established between Scotland and the north of England from the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together. "
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to look for further line capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our destination for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it has enormous advantages.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. "
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to "unmistakably" support Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian flight passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones when taking off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision that US airlines will have to do a lot of work to implement it, but do not have any immediate plans to change their rules.
The CASA also stated that the announcement would be looked at, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
‘CASA does not currently have any specific rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft', has been reported.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already had discussions with the CASA about extending his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and stated that one is open to change, but that these need to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of CASA's approval of electronic devices, as we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas said that the current rules will remain in place until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices may not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and modify manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer training.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be stowed safely under the seat or in the compartments over the seats during take-off and landing.
In front of the district derby against Schalke, fellow BVB supporters with flares had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that offered to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the fans with their songs were to be heard.
On the other hand, the South Tribune, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented itself exceptionally quietly at first: No songs, no battle cries.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint firing, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the grandstand, a large flag with the words "section ban on stadiums" was flying lonely.
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always as the first BVB player, entered the course, caused short-term cheer.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but far from everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern grandstand nothing moved.
Even the fact that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not make for a celebration mood.
Only five minutes before the whistle, the Capo climbed his podium - and until then the tension, which had been palpable with hands, was released in a loud scream when Dickel asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium as usual.
The last one was the south grandstand as usual - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was here again as usual.
And at the latest when the loud invitation "Derby Sieger Stands up" came from the South Tribune with a hint, everything was as usual again.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before the district derby at FC Schalke 04 some of the BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the audience and on the place - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was belatedly whistled for the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that," he said.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown different possibilities of punishment - by Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will impose a penalty by the end of next week.
"This is going to be drastic," said Watzke .
One can be curious as to how the reactions in the South Tribune turn out.
Pfandhäuser booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawnshop at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, it's all my money," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, her monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pawning jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore require an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4% required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or income proofs, which is why loans are faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressure from rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for pawnshops to compensate for the difference in the stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, called it a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, given rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices in the last two years have reinforced the trend towards pawning personal items, as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of pledged items are gold in the city's 200 pawnshops.
People say: "The gold price looks good, let's pawn grandmother's gold chain and get it back next month. "
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent increase in customers in recent months in its branches.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only offer lower interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household training," she explains.
The pawn loan business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are all people who use pawnshops in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
"These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service unveiler Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany solve the ever more explosive NSA spying affair.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Parliament, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify to a German prosecutor's office or to a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments due to cataracts, are to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist training, services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of the clinic staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report on where the additional funds were spent on a monthly basis.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable path."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these election benefits will largely compensate for recent cuts.
However, the public health spokesman of the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "pattle solution".
"We are in a position today because the Labor Government has deducted 430 million dollars from the health system," he told ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth 300 million in it and then pretends to be good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
The plot played in France in the 1760s tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips away in lustiness or sensationalism – and that's where his problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a painful penitent shirt for the audience as well.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gitft gas ammunition facilities, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, while serious clashes have occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are suspected to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date of
1 November, set up by the organization of Damascus, based in The Hague, to destroy or make "inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still has to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and deposits, as reported by the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory.
On Thursday, the activist group, which is persecuting the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, declared that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fights underscore the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its poisonous arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is "now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has witnessed their destruction."
Therefore, ‘no further inspection activities are currently planned'.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
The inspectors said that it was not possible to visit two facilities because of safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "discontinued ... and the existing chemical weapons facilities had been relocated to other facilities that had been inspected," according to the Syrian authorities.
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I take the hat of the bravery and courage you all showed in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Surveillance Organization, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong, a secession of Shia Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger over Judgment for Bali Bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombing in Bali reacted annoyed at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to trial, as Umar Patek believed that he would be shot under the law.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted people, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A charge was also made on a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb builder, is also called "Demolition Man".
The decision has awakened painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy was supposed to get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurt many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually seized in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict was given before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is being celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in airplanes (but do not have mobile phone calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not to make phone calls, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
According to FAA employee Michael Huerta, how quickly they would be implemented would depend on the respective airline at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of flight personnel and the arrangements for stowage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not restart until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing approach, passengers must switch them off again and must not take them off again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment also on take-off, landing and on the runway, said the FAA.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit," said Glading.
To be honest, we are tired of having to feel like caretakers on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections to surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometres remain prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave an American Airlines jet in public because he refused to shut down the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may repeal ban on certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national traffic issues on CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission poles," Rosenker says.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies mention that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore switching off the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers in 1966, after reports of disturbances in navigation and communication equipment by VHF radios carried by passengers had become known, which at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they do not mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when flipping around.
However, the transmission values are stronger when downloading or sending data.
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he felt that the interference from the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports from pilots who spoke for a malfunction of aircraft systems through the equipment, and most of them were very old.
The committee, however, recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the shut-down of the equipment by the passengers in case of instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued bird released by air rescue service from North Sea Drilling Island
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released into nature again.
The water coral was flown last month by helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was patched up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water rall was probably a winterly migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea. "
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling rig.
He added: "He could no longer fly, which is why we were contacted with the request for help. "
When she was released, the water rall was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives representing, for example, British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while countries in the EU are stagnating.
They hope that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be favored by government instead of staying with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their opinion, the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster on certain issues regulated by law – from antitrust law to product legislation.
There was general dissatisfaction about the single market, as companies said that the costs of Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with this, which is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and probably most of all, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wanted a course to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "senseful change" that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
Much is at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect renegotiation to significantly shift power back to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means greater attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and his counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other downstream countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past Germany as a real estate location.
The economic framework data are correct and the funding possibilities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, the view of the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial properties are.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year's period.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of allegations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with child-related sexual offences before being charged in 2011, as learned by the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that "the organisation had never been involved in an incident involving sexual child abuse. "
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there were external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety".
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started with the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had failed "from me down" in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report breaches of the child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted of sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA at the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations of child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for her privately as a babysitter, left her sitting on his lap, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's supervisor at YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable."
The managing director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Hare stated that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW of his view that the lesson that the organization had to learn from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about employee reporting" and that the board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to push employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations were made had been taken by the managing director of the YMCA's child services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was to prevent contamination of the evidence, but that this had been "overzealous " and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruiting, checking, training, and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the horse show experts arrived in droves in Cardiff to select the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirp, who is not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of them the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had his plate cap put on at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which were far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a present for his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great team. "
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered him up and clapped. "
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
Just as he started, it won't be long before he's on the "horse of the year" show – and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony. "
Together, they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton's sweet clothes helped her part, that was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper demanding the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation on the front page was to be reformed, said a press regulator.
Guangzhou-based New Express had issued a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on TV that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
The New Express is now subject to "comprehensive rectification", the regulator said.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the Neue Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports about the listed company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that they had decided to "implement an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter's license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group had been instructed to complete the rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant persons responsible for the New Express and immediately check the New Express leadership team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page and stated that they had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year when the authorities were banned from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnels discovered with own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they'd ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug - laden trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized in it, the authorities explained.
The discovery of the tunnel involved eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the court's records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences between ten years and life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of bringing their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 metre long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a residence in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly the way we plan or hope for it."
Kerr and himself still loved each other, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very considerable way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edamer, these gluttonies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan abandons all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains may be asked, but on closer inspection the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor exclaims the maxim of vegans, which extends to the entire consumption behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan is not a waiver, it's not asceticism, it's an enrichment." Proctor's assumption that the food change reduces the choice of food options is more due to the power of habit.
And exactly these conditionings also made some still so well meant attempt fail.
"The addictive factor is a crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And say, "Some tastes are not attached to the beast."
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste good once.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste good, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," Proctor says.
He had not suffered any health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan food.
"My blood counts are good, I often get checked," Proctor reveals.
Many vegansimus critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12 in particular.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the freezer," says Proctor.
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor did not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on the spot.
I only buy something special once in a while.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is what it is known for "ordinary" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time consuming than is commonly assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few little tricks you can achieve good, if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecakes Proctor could also amaze his parents-in-law.
Family festivals give the vegan a new spice.
This is dynamic, when you cook together, it has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was also skeptical.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now, because I drink milk?" - with such questions one has to act as a vegan with a touch.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to be enclaves.
And in more detail, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan doesn't seem as limited in everyday life as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he evades pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are starting to adjust to it.
"When I started to eat vegan food 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it".
"If there is enough demand, they may be inclined to complement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
In particular, if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be contained in peanuts as colouring agents, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
Not only for this reason have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products.
" Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows which characters and logos one has to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to do small steps than stop or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger pointer that strikes the consciousness.
Maybe he doesn't quite manage to put down his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
The trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a series of minor and major failures at the stock exchange operator.
It was not until Tuesday that Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two breakdowns in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trading in the US came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Facebook's IPO also caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown up to the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established the SEC and thundered the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Konstanz: Cyclists are driving around 63-year-olds
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at around 10 p.m., was on the left sidewalk from Bahnhofplatz in the direction of Marktstätte.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on the sidewalk from a restaurant, according to the police, the cyclist could no longer slow down in time.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and pulled a roughly 15 centimetre long space wound on the head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police send Assange an extradition notice
The British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeak's founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "request to surrender" asking him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply, he would be arrested.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden for the charge of a sexual offence, after his possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the US, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "has ordered a 40-year-old man to come to a police station at one of our chosen times," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible espionage charges after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks unveiling website.
Driver who was racing with 210 km/h and hot drink between his legs receives 1,000 £ penalty
A car driver was fined £1,000 because he had been driving between his legs at up to 210 km/h and a hot drink.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
In the court of Colchester, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay £90 and a £100 victim's premium.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a 7 % stamp tax on apartments costing over two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
The income from the stamp duty on housing in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in 2012/13 was £708 million, is already in excess of the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced homes and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is hard to claim that high-quality properties are undertaxed, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system. "
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have increased by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog's tail wading is related to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs turned their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known to humans that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions. "
Here we tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swirling of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), her heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the waving with the tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences. "
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animal's emotions.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada said: "Dogs tend to go towards a robot dog when his 'tail' is waving to the left and not to the right, instead of getting restless – exactly the opposite of the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior can easily be recorded, it probably won't be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer has become infected with larynx.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to be playing in the hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has to be transferred.
The band's announcement came after having to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "After deciding to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys will also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
"A larynx infection was diagnosed with Alex Turner, which is why he can't occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on November 20th, which was moved to November 21st at the Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointed new Cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the election of the Pope – this applies to a group of 120 "appointed cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, would be held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He said that a pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary to make the number of cardinals eligible to vote 120 again, and as many cardinals as he would like over 80.
The Consistory next year was important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, says Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it was "well possible" for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation so far – that's all new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places are typically called to cardinals, but Francis "is full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints".
GM Recalls New Pickup Trucks in the USA to Repair the Seat Lean
General Motors is recalling just under 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, built in 2014, to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a communication from the US Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat back.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is driven up from the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," was the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks started in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not check the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation cry of a Obama elector
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs on the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It's a book that I thought would cheer me up and give me hope again during the dim second year of my medical studies.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records and go to bed in the evening, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and took my breath away from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and news anchors paused to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had approval values of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if being torn out of a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the passing of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the ending of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the Party's policy of blocking has overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I ended up trying to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are allowed to be interrogated or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives and why whistleblowers are punished who expose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that states that the White House's efforts to restrain the media are "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government."
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that the government's work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the deputy office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with Obama's approval levels falling to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become all the harder with this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week, I read a section of the book that describes how Obama had to take a serious loss against Clinton at the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict with his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim as he wanted to get questions off the table as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes will be cancelled or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she is on leave or not," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting counting process to speed it up.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which we march in, enter the data into a computer, dial it immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers.
Is it used because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
It's incredible to use pencils these days.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office was concerned with public service.
"We do not seek any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community in a critical time," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, so two people familiar with the situation, which is another indication that the worldwide investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly taking on board.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, with a daily change of ownership of 5.3 billion US dollars.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that would result in the scandal surrounding Libor's interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigation on this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people related to the situation reported that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent to and from an earlier trader to the UK regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now expected to have been suspended from his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week, and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher's Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies reduces the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks leads to the fact that "one can influence the market even at very low ticket prices".
The news came out the same day Credit Suisse announced that she had quit a London Exchange Traded Funds agent this week after causing a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and cooperated with the competent authorities.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," said Credit Suisse.
The fence on the Bechtle plot painted
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and widened the footpath, says a press release.
The planned cover of the disintegrating house in the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the area threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed to the beautification operation with his colleague Reinhard Domke of BI.
Before the action of the BI a banner with the message "We are for it" had been installed.
However, this did not bother the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative very much in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
Thus she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In a conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city's project will be much better for many, although many have the same questions as BI's.
But they begin to resign because the city continues to delay these answers, says the BI.
As we can hear, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
At the local council meeting on May 12, he said that he was afraid that the spa would end if the people voted against the plans for a spa and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow.
Some of them seem terrified because of this, while others feel that they are a "plumb blackmail attempt" on the population, says the press release of BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the helpers.
Ranknick Shelter for Shiris: Mane no swallow king
Just as Ralf Rangnick is satisfied with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bullen" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he took the two offensive swirls in protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which Senegalese became an alleged act - which was of course none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A gross wrong decision," said Rangnick, who called referee Harkam "totally overburdened."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He firmly defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old emphasized.
However, in view of the success of the race, Rangnick agreed to a praise anthem.
"There are only two words for that: really good," he said.
There's not much to expose.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep this up.
There will hardly be any cadre changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Apart from a player's desire to leave the club," Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court Confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the state's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts took the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the requirement of the Health Act that states should either extend the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise remove all state funding for Medicaid was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunfall, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers adjusted sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) project.
A similar construction has provided the Italian alpine village of Viganella with winter sunshine for some years.
Post barely emptys on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
The answer to the FDP's question will not answer whether there is still a Sunday emptying in Hofheim and Rosengarten.
The social- and youth-political spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to check here.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service, especially when it comes to appointment mail.
"Despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, this company is radically and unreasonably thinning out this undertaking."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals' political group and city association, supports his fellow political groups: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are being changed or also deleted in a clandestine manner."
The post office is miles away from citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the Neuschloss and Rosengarten districts have to be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Even for the core city, especially not mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office did not communicate with Lampertheim.
However, there is also a Sunday emptying of his knowledge in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the city's magistrate advises on a presentation of traffic decernant Stefan Majer (Greens).
According to this, parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the price should not be increased, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the store was "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "absolutely appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions to get rid of hosts
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen.
The calves were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
But soon it turned out that they could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadters, also due to age.
With the hard and placed hits, the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of Freudenstadters in all matters.
In the face of this crushing and game-determining performance, the third set was won a little lazily and without a desire to reach the 3-0 finals (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to assert itself clearly in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts, especially in the acceptance of the ball; even in the passports the precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical game scenes the over zeal prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this very well-balanced encounter, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team consistently matched the great physical effort and a gratifying commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
On the fifth day of nursing in succession to the Natura 2000 project upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut out on this day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Emperor, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents on nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations could also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Government Bureau explained this ecological aspect in the wake of the welcome by the district councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to the Tribukait, the tourist objective of the foresight coincides with the goal of maintaining the now strongly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free links to conservation.
Tribukait said she would not miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
In this planning, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved for the future with the Life project as well as the previous days of care.
Following these various presentations, Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance and the forest tug was ready to be retrieved if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the clear view at the lookout point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and senior citizens' policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive city, no second candidate for mayor has yet registered.
The 46-year-old bank clerk and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen is the only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who no longer runs for age reasons.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, tightened an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was outbid by him at Nortel's insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that had purchased Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concerned technology that reconciles search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid for 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being outbid by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patent claims at the auction, Google has infringed and continues to do so," says the complaint letter.
Rockstar claims a high level of compensation from Google as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt sworn first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, who have their seat on the Nile and are modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood trained in the USA, a fundamentalist group that, since its foundation 84 years ago, had been heavily targeted by the respective government as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential splendour of the Mubarak period, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the autoconvoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "substitute wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to target the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," explained Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wood paneled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army band that played the national anthem, to which he listened in vigilance.
Military commander Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people present in the university's largest lecture hall with speeches from "The Army and the People are One Hand".
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the Cairo University has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had taken over from the Chief of State who had been chased out of office.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Today's Friday night is called "Pump this party", tomorrow's Saturday night will continue with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers fell from ladder: severely injured
When replacing a defective external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder on Thursday and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior facade of an inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder leaning on the gutter, the ladder slipped away and the man fell onto the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to the Landeskrankenhaus Salzburg with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapists in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the station SABC.
The victim had later died as a result of the serious injuries.
John Cana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused national horror.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for 14 hours to survive the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Cana had admitted during the trial that she had been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the trial.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but he denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
During the trial, the prosecutor's office also stressed that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost part of the daily routine in South Africa: every year there are about 64,000 reports of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark figure for sexual violence, however, at 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pork legs, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo sighted for strengthening at fast food in Waldshut
"I'm working huge quantities here," the television makers, Black Forest ham, marvel as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what is important in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at the age of six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I can't wait to hear what happens to Roberto Blanco," said Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's worth watching anyway.
The spectator sees that cutting the clubs is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones.
The secret of the ham is the spice mix with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing remind Jumbo optically of a "sub".
The trick: fir branches in the smoke provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
"It's really delicious," says the TV star.
This will enable everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted pre-tax annual profit of between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290,4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner announced that Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on track towards record annual income before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest winners of results.
In Australia, the leisure sector recovered in the second half of the year, which made up for a slightly weaker business travel market.
It went similarly well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonal weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the year as a whole is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes "unseen texts " to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that "there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "more demanding, more ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from the right life", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The Kreisverbandsleistungsschau presents the most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour strokes at the Bürgerhaus this weekend.
The evaluations were already made on Thursday
Once again the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the associations in the Soest district show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and distinguished outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed, as the evaluation of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition takes place by Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3.30 pm, which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola equipped with stately prizes and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
At the next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, 21 October, the New Museum of the Castle will focus on the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on the Dealing with the Last Things Today".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to explore the question of how today people classify the "last things" after death.
If the people in the past centuries had known too much about it and had put it on those images of heaven and hell "which still shape our ideas today", the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of perfection is characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have been lost".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death."
The question of that longing, which "dreams of the fact that everything may be good in the end", is connected with this.
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair in Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their creed at the confirmation
In two services 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the pastoral care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were confirmed.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners, the Firmlings had prepared themselves for the great feast day.
In various projects they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced together the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In beautiful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to cope with the circuit over the hill chains around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel from the organiser Sportverein Illmensee tells us.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 altitude meters, were also numerous everyone's cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good rankings at the German championships.
These two were able to leave the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
==References====External links==*Official website
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare who made it to the top of the podium.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen came in second and third place.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years with the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race even more absolute top athletes were at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to set off from the top regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk-Racing-Team.
Together with a teammate, Pangerl has already been the world champion in the twelve-hour race twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German championship titles in the Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was an eyelash final in the finish in front of the three-laken-hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Only one second behind him, the Routinier Ballerstedt managed to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came into the finish line as third of the overall classification.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then there was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States is for a doctor for 413 persons.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle matured the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people forced themselves into minibuses and drove the latched medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages that needed help.
Things don't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his broad smile and his limitless energy – is happy to attend the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team will start examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The surgery usually takes place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the surgery and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a tiring crowd, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They are drumming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work it makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a hernia he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable work, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteering to work in Bwelle's group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations where we can help to remove blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies with them.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He is without doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, fulfilling a promise he has made to his Father, gives him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old rabbit in his profession of acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago with fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits on the chair tired of life bent, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is on stage as a single actor on long distances.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made up of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he illuminates the active scene: Santiago's hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise's favor, which sings Cuba's way of life with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Relegation to the Romans
At a length of about 120 meters, a sewage canal from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne do not pass the cathedral.
About 157 meters the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, know that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne Tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore the remains of the old city walls stopped only that which was not too large.
Most users of the car park therefore rush past the Roman remains today and only park their car.
But if you take a closer look, an archaeological site separated by metal lattice bars is discovered in the D2 parking deck.
There are about five meters high ruins of hand plate-sized stones to be seen.
"These are remnants of the Roman city walls that were built in the second half of the first century AD," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants climb down again into the depth.
Here we experience the headquarters of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the prestor of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means "city Roman right and city of the Agrippinensians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the praetorium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here at about 120 meters length.
"You can quietly walk along the Cloaca Maxima if you want," says Schulze, cheering the guests up.
Schulze still has one more surprise.
After fetching the key at the cash register, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the ground water, which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work will begin shortly.
However, some years will pass before completion.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rockermilieu is reopened after over four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds began in front of the Regional Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants remained silent at the start.
They were said to have been active in the rocker scene and were part of the bandidos at the time.
The prosecution accused them of stabbing and beating three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, it was preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the charges, it was about precinct fights and a power demonstration.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof lifted the sentence after the prosecution was reviewed and referred it back to the Landgericht for further proceedings.
One of the defendants is currently on trial for another offense.
At the beginning it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes on the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the then investigating commissioner was invited.
The focus was on cell phone calls from the defendants and other people who had been intercepted by the police.
It's difficult that rockers in court almost always adhere to a law that is more for them - and do not testify.
That also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor's Office Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that there have been new traces since the last trial.
Eleven further days of negotiations are scheduled for the process.
The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the passenger and rear seat the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or champagne may be responsible for this!
What's closer than riding to the next drive-in to get a little something?
I admit, I like to be with you when it goes to fast food-holen late at night or early in the morning.
A couple of fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco singers are noticeable.
Because what must you miss, that you throw with constant regularity your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags are located at the edges of the road and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It's not just that the paperwork spoils the landscape.
Bags have already covered traffic facilities such as guardrails and caused accidents.
But she doesn't even know what that word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
There would be a few bags more or less nothing - in contrast to the street, where nobody wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I see the day coming when the cities and communities will become too stupid to clean up - and the fast food chains will have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama's Backward Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama made a retreat yesterday in his often repeated, unequivocal promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received a letter of termination from their insurer, the Republicans accused the president of deceiving the American public in the last few days.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama urged those Americans who have received such communications to look for new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
The government considered it unsurprising that the five percent of the population who took out insurance had to look for a different tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards of the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans very directly: they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives' Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform had been "slightly" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing was received after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly insisted on the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced state-sponsored insurance in order to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Base
On Thursday, an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter planes attacked an air force base in Syria's Latakia the day before.
According to CNN, the target was "missiles and associated equipment", which the Israeli government had feared were destined for the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot at on Thursday night from Wednesday, and the Israelis blamed for it.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base, showing Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles and a SA-3 battery, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an Israeli government official who is also anonymous, saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
At any rate, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said: "We do not comment on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai, in Yedioth Ahronoth's daily newspaper, stressed that the Syrian regime had previously, partly successfully, tried to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line" that would be followed by a military response.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented admission that the U.S. espionage "has gone too far beyond measure"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated a softening of the US's defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying that espionage "has gone too far in certain cases. "
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying became public.
The leaked information has led the US government to a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a video-conference speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, as well as others in the government, have, without question, learned of some of the things that have passed by autopilot simply because the ability to do so existed, which goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, this has gone inappropriately too far. "
The President is determined to provide clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its monitoring processes.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. "
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing, blowing up people and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have indeed prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have learned about such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US in anti-terrorist efforts, as stated by the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration of National Security Agency surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a Democrat and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes.
Media reports that NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of intelligence said this week that the reports were incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the Congress's journey to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the grudge over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from joining FC Augsburg in the Bundesliga away match of the FSV Mainz 05.
Mainz is engaged by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his deployment at short notice," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six hits.
Because the Mainzers have already to renounce the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian appeal against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket because she falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage from a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having made up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a low-security detention centre on the edge of Phuket instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to ask for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are, of course, very worried, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is on bail of 50,000 Baht at large.
In Australian reports, it was noted that she is on holiday in Krabi in southern Thailand in the meantime.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its poor tourist image, and there is therefore an acquittal.
