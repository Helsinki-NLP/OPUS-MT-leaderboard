Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Munich" candidates perform shooting with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shoot is available in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that naturally depends on one getting into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as stated in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite the month-long debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be so," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also justified him by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation has not yet come about".
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris had to be removed to the extent strictly necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery to charge for lunch.
That might be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, for the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself, as she apparently wants to snatch children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and releases a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of doing child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan says in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
Eventually, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
Looks like she's turning around and slapping Lohan.
Under tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi increases to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 fatalities.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Chief of Supervisory Board
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletroautomaker.
He was sued for fraud by the U.S. Stock Exchange Inspectorate, but now both of them have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the Party Congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, Boris Johnson, the front-line ex-foreign minister.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they've come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on it this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brazils" acts as an anti-system candidate and is thus in the lead in the polls.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" reprocessing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still in existence," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, to the industry journal "Automobilwoche".
Audi head Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car maker had made "gravitating organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after the detection of the flue gas frauds.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At present, the company is headed by Bram Schot, Chief Executive Officer of the Board of Directors.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations available.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm to join the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President in the coming year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup event and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You always have to make an effort to re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association would find it "notable" in his own words if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the match for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who had fallen over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm will be working in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise the Bureau in this role and then, of course, be warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Properly lose weight with a half-wise scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the percentage of body fat.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the purges.
Doesn't he say if I replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominating Berlin with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) signed from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his mandatory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was best shot with 24 points in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings excelled at the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweigers, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne's city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in action - including snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe und Schrecksekunde
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert at Central Park in New York.
"Commit wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations, also showed up at the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a scare second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshot, scared, and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and diseases on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - shouts for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court in the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee, and thus pushed many women against their heads.
At least three women have filed charges of abuse against Kavanaugh up to attempted rape, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the charges after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," Flake said to the crowd at the New York concert.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends dismissal of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the dismissal of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a matter of disrupting the process of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had caused personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not certain of the Turkish authorities: Only at the beginning of September was Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for its lively conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour bar "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also have the courage to play the obligatory vocals.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Bewertung" or "Der geilste Tag".
But the trip to the far north didn't get well for the Munich.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely snuffed on it, his eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely worn out Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER goes to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And leave the round of egg liqueurs that Ina throws at 6:30.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the afterlife.
They ranged from instant broths, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nightly bouncing.
Since she moderates the TV fun at the counter already since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and misconduct
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly apparent.
Shards, cigarette dumps, garbage and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entry with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike trail in the Red Riding Hoodland a more than infamous sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the bicycle traffic officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Radverkehrsbeirat.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the imperative of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it also destroys the layers: the posts are torn out of the ground, trash cans are demolished, signs are folded, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"The focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also worried about the new bike park in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher to attack common property.
This would, however, require a police patrol to pass in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
He said he needed to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequenting of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning trail on the Haaße hill.
In case of heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-way traffic flows," she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for a music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long Albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
According to district mayor Joachim Schmidt, this contest is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see connected to?
At the places the Hiltruper lake and the market avenue were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honored.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about her work.
Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed a lot on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Hemig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again to the finale - and even without electronic support sounded "properly good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchiness of melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four maps with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only after you put them into it.
This ensures that the opposite side is not able to read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, it says to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
Three dice.
4th Festival".
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
Because here, not the terms, but codes are to be guessed.
One player per team alternates is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2.".
In "Decrypto" they should not guess the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cure", "fix" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the concepts of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with any hint that the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the descriptions should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about guessing and not about winning points, can also easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also appeared in a bar in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he did not comply with the evidence given by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be held liable for the use of signs of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig factory was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers popped on buffers, you heard it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squealed and the wagons gnawed.
It was just a train.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters has its vertex in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, train and thrust locomotives, which had their home in Pressig, were needed in the past.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshops, cabling and railway workshops.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and for 47 years a professional railway operator.
The Pressig railway depot, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 they were used only for freight trains.
Up to 1991, at least 10,000 weights were still placed each month.
In 1982, parts of the factory were demolished, and in 1991 the rest of the plant was demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not considered a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling station was history.
"The shunters and shunters did the most difficult work in train traffic," remembers Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian who was placed at number 13 gave up.
The swäbin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Kunst und Genuss" a special exhibition was opened on the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great ease registered organizers and visitors looked the ideal weather, when the special opening "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was demonstrated by a large number of visitors.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task into proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have been involved in designing flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical frame.
During the walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a piece of sound.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object appears fairytale-like and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On half way Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy formation of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" to stroll through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also aired their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bench in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten out of the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It will be full today," assumed Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
They had revived the Foundation's festival for the anniversary itself.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, for festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats in the "House of Encounters" as usual, but at tables.
In between, movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten sounded the voice themselves.
Matching the occasion, happy songs were announced.
Almost put it: " Such a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" was performed, which is the Latin term for "hops".
Richard Homann, who was one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at that time, was once again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it's a feat he's doing." By the way, not only men presented themselves singing this time.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented good-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the Allwetterzoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascender is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring can be found quite well in Liga 3.
No sign of shyness or flaws, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker agreed immediately: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring the goal to the goal, a game like this can tip," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We all know who's on the other side of such a derby.
It doesn't break our necks.
I have seen quite good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not argue with the 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independent seems not foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with Regionalliga Volleyball". In the fourth league they don't want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the series could have had a co-inflict with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as head hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left the ship forever.
The series, which made her star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," says Keller in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
At first she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he didn't want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have disguised myself", as she further explains.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I was sitting crying in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively".
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ resort in Zurich, has ventured into the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the glaring glamour in which a green carpet is immersed in the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds it over a fee.
But it's just film festival, more or less famous ones want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he torses over the square to ease himself briefly in the "Aquaclean WC-Oase".
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The needy institution on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's Oase for some reason to heaven.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the festival start with a party at the three-storey department store like every year.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works on display come from the whole globe.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into covert advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a volume around the feelers, which has attached a good fairy to him, and two bully doormen actually waved him in generically.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance far after midnight to live music or let DJ rhythms to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite bites with Cüpli.
In the delicacy shop in the basement oysters are waiting for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut open, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he's gone into the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has already saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the poultry tip a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for that brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But between local celebrities, cash table and kitchen items, a face that is known to the observer passes by: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor shouldn't be far away.
And really: Right away Viggo Mortensen, with nearly sixty almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not being chatted, he's not being beggared, he's not being cheated.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as clumsiness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is happy about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican second division had defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Sending to last minute broke "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - broke - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we have totally sleepy", the ASV trainer annoyed.
The owners quickly led with 8:1, even the early break, which Bieletzki had taken, did not at first bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up for the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially Sending Bester, Marius Hintze, met in the phase again and again.
After the change it became even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15:15, then the relay changer led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then?
Put the impartials into action.
Bieletzki is usually careful not to blame others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and threw again and again at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory has to come," said Bieletzki.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police digs for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
Forces dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
To this end, the road surface and several layers of it were removed, as police and prosecutors shared.
New evidence suggests that missing persons may not have been buried far from their place of residence at that time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively on the case together with the prosecutor's office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained in the smell of human bones, the officials narrowed the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are lurking on the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Stock Exchange Supervision SEC filed an out-of-court lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay 20 million dollars, and Musk also gives up the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He's allowed to remain Chief of the Board.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also in charge of SpaceX, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He had always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying 420 dollars per share, and that the financing was secured.
Tesla would have been valued at 72 billion dollars in total.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

"Let's Dance"-Juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi probably broke up with his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhal Inhalt) reports on the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert, citing Llambi's lawyer.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
According to the querels of the past weeks, the GroKo collects several poll low strokes.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in an interview - Angela Merkel is critically viewed.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday nationwide.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD scores one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would, according to Emnid, get only 43 percent of the votes together.
This means that the grand coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a total of 53.4%.
For the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, in several polls second largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, while FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards, depending on the percentage of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens still find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there were also significant losses of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans are also judging whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
Thus, 64 percent of the Union's supporters would like to have a candidacy, 35 percent not.
Aushang bei Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi becoming Tinder 2.0?
Who says in the times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a place to meet the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargain at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being not so much a contact, but rather a slippery stock market.
We have dared the test: How do women react, you don't talk about the hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
It's the right Hollywood-Lovestory potential when the love luck precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-refound plot.
If the guy also registers with his loved ones at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in a Aldi branch unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic putty".
For believing in the magic of analogue getting to know her, she definitely deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been involved in the action "Liddle against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, referred to in German as polio, leads from signs of paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to have been eradicated, but there are still three countries around the world where the disease occurs.
So far, the cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be contained by immunization, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace and quiet for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Reus, a friend of Götze's, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry with contract discussions with Hecking

"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit and talk," Eberl said on Sunday night on TV station Sky.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researchers appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg, coach of VfL Wolbeck, retired (inside) to reflect on the lack of commitment on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is again running around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only very thinly past the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We have narrowed the rooms and exerted pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and went to each individual for the game, simply to say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes in the front front waited for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost it would have been avenged when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box twice in a minute of 41 by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late for a Thewes entry after 58 minutes.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left side again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The foult took part himself and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flap hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the penalty room unfortunately to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange Minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske still had the victory hit on the push in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Starting position: Four points after five days of playing - coach Adi Hütter couldn't do that.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home win.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who was in the starting team for the first time after an injury, was supposed to help.

Helicopters crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. there was a drama at the airport in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
During the landing of a helicopter turbulence occurred, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was caught by a windboe, crashed to the ground and came to a slump on the side.
Police, rescue and fire services were immediately notified.
With a large task force, the forces came to the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and could go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to the firefighter Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could be quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
Thus, only 8 percent of the board members were female on September 1st, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was available to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in advance.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams - with a few exceptions - are far from conceivable.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchanges was due solely to positive impulses among the companies in the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
At the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to make a commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: on 1 September the proportion of women there was 30.5 per cent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If there were just as many women recruited for the board of directors each year, a share of 40 percent would have been reached by 2023," the report says.
Some even make a mess: Luxury coach: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians receive 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros of operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are even strong on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros earnings before interest and taxes.

Torch procession at the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
The Tourist Association opened its Wine Festival session in Abtswind with a torchlight train.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which start every Saturday in October in the large marquee at Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the jubilee, the responsible people moved under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn through the place to the Festplatz.
The chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already busy marquee. "60 years of organizing something like this - this is a fantastic achievement for a small village with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically struck with the guests from the stage.
"Nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "The Troglauer" provided a mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association set the drinks prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5th, in the guest's house, before going one day later in the marquee into the second round.
In Bonn: Ambulance car crashes in taxi
An ambulance is badly damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passerby has been fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an ambulance with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance had run over a red traffic light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then met on a crossing with the taxi that drove at Grün.
The doctor's car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passerby, who died at the scene of the accident.
Emergency car driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency forces.
The 29-year-old doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could not help her anymore.
Another called emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn prosecutor's office, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After a blaming break in the league cup, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is under ManU 1:3. The way of defeat is likely to still be talkable.
The 74th minute scene in which the regenerated Marko Arnautovic shot 3:1 for West Ham was symbolic; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all the defenders of Manchester stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
At the moment, the mood at United's city rival Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion for a 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defense bar of the outsider for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer the leader in the table
Three days after the 1–2 defeat in the Liga Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool won a 1:1 victory in the Premier League against Chelsea.
As in the Cup-off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only match of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with an impeccable balance, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and then the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the league.
Like City, London's Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) clubs celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played, however, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buxed an entry by Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal in the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive victory and is now immediately behind the great rival Tottenham in 5th place.A strong impression continues to be made by Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at the 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show in the light of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, they will be showcasing their innovations in the French capital together with competitors from all over the world at the Automotive Salon 2018.
The diesel doesn't really matter much anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic, at least behind the brilliant scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have, among other things, their first pure electric models: The Ingolstädter e-tron is scheduled to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
However, both were officially presented.
The iNext from BMW is not scheduled to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new three-piece.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
In the severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami, at least 380 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, and there is enormous damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still significantly higher.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
Affected are also numerous other municipalities - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 o'clock the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker's early shoot was on the agenda and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the Biker service by Reverend Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical accompaniment.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetically calm," says Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big celebration: after the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the process from ripe apple to apple juice step by step to his astonishing spectators.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how this would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to take a look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in forms and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces that look a little bit like hickselgut layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the fugitive farmer also had ready-filled specialties with him.
So he opened his "Treasure Box" and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly great.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active of the fugitive camaraderie of former soldiers engaged themselves during the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
The Heimatverein will also be offering an action day next year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious on the basis of the topic: after all, the milk will then be round.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season broke: "Fucky Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed pros of Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive in the last table of Eintracht Frankfurt at 1:4 (0:2) before.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "Of course, that's disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met to the connection, stand with two counters at the bottom and are in their current constitution a descent candidate.
On the other hand, led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB trophy winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who, after the successful rehearsal for the European League match against Lazio Rome, scored seven points in the midfield of the table.
Croatia's vice-champion of the world, Rebic, was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse in his debut and never managed to get control of Hanover's defense.
With his speed and assertiveness, the striker, long after the World Cup, showed why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, which was loaned by Liverpool FC, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, which began with a dynamic start.
Lucas Torró (17th)'s headball on the net of goals brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-refuge around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserving.
Filip Kostic raised the ball to the penalty room after a corner, Haller extended it by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to stop his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for AJ Auxerre's second division player in the summer.
And Frankfurt fell off before the break.
This time, Haller fit his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled and 96-doorkeeper Michael Esser didn't take a chance.
In the mid-term Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak imagination of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Niedersachsen played a bit more courageously forward, but igniting ideas remained out until shortly before the end, when after all the connecting hit succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After less than an hour Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurters against overburdened guests only show-runs, also Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter made it to millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Municher Wies'n last week with two beats.
Geisingen: Geisingen Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who came from the 30-year-old war and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this a large pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Reverend Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The church service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the divine service the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the feast of the Cross ended.
For many years the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage has been determined more precisely and the individual tenders have been prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only possible by the appearance by means of scaffolding.
The pedestal plastering work is completed, before winter the natural stone work is to be started and it is hoped that more than half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residence for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" is now handed over to its destination - all those present agreed on the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have already been living in the residence of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former US Army officer's building was put to the test for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
About 4.6 million euros was invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many specifications, which allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile".
The comfort and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this position is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square metres, divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a payroll basis.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unit.
We must not content ourselves with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang presented two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs to South Korean President Moon Jae.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their recipient already on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to "acquaint themselves".
The dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
At the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the North announced the gift of friendship in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the Olympic Games in 2032.
Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines as part of the mutual approach.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the actual work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU finally did not conjure up the "return to substantive work" in a mantra-like manner.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and actual work, but be it that way.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mission - to govern - it should not be prevented from doing so by means of conceptual debates.
Monday may show whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet to form the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, however, the issue of diesel retrofits and the Skilled Workers' Migration Act is once again on the agenda of conflict-prone issues.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange awards, while SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned labour migration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "purchase" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute between the coalition partners - and how else should it be?
It is not equal and equal that has joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Fighting's good.
Without a dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory, interests is not progressing.
However, in order to be constructive, there must be no uplifting of conflict for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are supposed to argue - but always have the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is why the People's Party must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, violate the applicable right of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legists had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is astonished - it brings the matter to Parliament now via request.
She assumes that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and not to announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to "acquit Har tinger of any suspicion".
Police tear down a street in search of women's corpses
Marxgrün - For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was anticipated that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able, together with his guide, to limit the relevant spot to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian conservation authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year, prosecutor's office and criminal police court have been handling the missing person's case.
Again and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried here in the course of the new building of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia-Jahrestag
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia marks the first time.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police mission of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police have taken place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the supporters of independence with paint powder, among other things, when they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 police officers from the Police Departments Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues at a rally in the polling stations last year in the illegal referendum.
In the attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the separatists and the central security forces apart, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would then have tried violently to break the police chain, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officials.
Six people had been arrested, 24 others had been slightly injured, according to the authorities.
Monday is the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Condensed perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split up goallessly
Red-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Also with FC Gütersloh it reached only a 0:0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third last one turned out to be a total perplexity.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
So if you wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst, you could not worry about it.
There was no danger of missing a goal, because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the whole game in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty line.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Müttel from 18 meters aimed just above the housing and after an hour, the Güterslohers also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a shooting of Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
The quickly performed counter over Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a lax shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they put on a Wieckowicz headball (66th) after a corner ball of ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Müttel (70.).
It did nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than visual superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but she didn't make any difference either.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately, the zero was also in the lead.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede and even though our opponent didn't want to play with us," said RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was a bit flaking" against a team that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a counter-gate," Daut says.
To his sorrow, however, the audience did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld Table Edition, for which these donations are intended, are pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky turned bright blue, but the place was still a little empty, but that was supposed to change during the day.
Because: "It's so pleasant here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit, as always, with a proper pinch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain musically the increasingly growing visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung along later on.
"Simply great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased about the many active people with their booths, among them mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a blackboard," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "Clean up" action that took place in September.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - here something goes.
Then the Maikranz was taken away by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to Winterquartier.
Many stalls were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decupier saw.
He had veneer works, beer lids with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, as good as the cake tasted.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to linger for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricating with local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknown people have advertised for the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly conducive.
In several places, there are corresponding briberies, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been sued for material damage.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" (Skatepark for Lengerich), among other things, flaunt on signs at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the trade fair on 19 September a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt bistro was discovered.
Since the short message at that time had apparently been left "only" with an edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally voted in favour of the majority of the fire-fighting parking.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building at this point.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now unanimously voted for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is then given to the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be made in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of an improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Traffic Control Union, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control services, for which there was no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for ready-made pilots is empty throughout Europe.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, around a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic City to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work condensation and overtime, it won't work without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German air traffic control company.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot misdemeanor.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at national air traffic control services are now fully consistent with operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to support regulations in Brussels that "do not cut off the air any further".
At present, the EU's targets would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU is constantly under lobby pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs of airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", said Maas.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilot pupils per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to rebuild the company.
According to Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to have their headquarters in Essen and to be listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction in staff beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and subcontracting.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of policemen and Catalan supporters of independence.
Two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish policemen and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large bid.
However, according to the forces, supporters of independence repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and gunshots.
According to the reports, there were also inter-participants in the various protest movements.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators found it a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke" the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British Minister
A security vulnerability in a mobile phone app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and representatives of the conservative British Tory party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hanover police reported a serious traffic accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game after the early delay by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and depended on the worst chaser for the time being.
The goal hunter brought from Real Madrid first put up the former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who provided for the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work on the goal of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th) after a corner by headball, who just had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goaltender is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' superiority seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.

But at the latest after the rejection of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top team was decided.
The Portuguese had to climb too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.

The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the course in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is closed for the home game against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly bizarre performance, Rapper Kanye West paid attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "ye," according to the musician.
"The being that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted, following the late singer Prince, when he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and there it means "you," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage did not hide his disappointment.
This was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we have hardly ever put him before problems". Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar bullets reads thinly.
Gradually two goals in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first run, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after a great preliminary work by Krause, he was free-standing.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when first Moritz Höne failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and found his master in Jan Blome's second shot in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
A commercial meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the gate line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann also could not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other hard before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he said.
"We didn't get any access to them at all." With them he probably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all other green-whites, who stood out with collective offensive drive.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling from then on His players, however, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class preservation.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0-2, as we keep against it over the entire season against one of the top teams in the league, that was really phenomenal."
It is all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goal hunter Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season goal (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He put the 2-0 over the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was already insanity, what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent enviously.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf made the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia gatekeeper Hinkerohe into the long gate (45.).
After the side change, it was again McGill who scored the balance (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann compared (69.).
In spite of the high number, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.).
We must now focus fully on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten is what we now have to win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbucker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The team leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Entire Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire executive board of football second division Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media called for a joint letter from the board of Saxony.
A confirmation of the association was not available at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Celebrities and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to personally pick up the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
Christian Wulff's term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there as a guest.
Thus, Academy Director Udo Hahn reckoned him when he said proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." However, the fact that celebrities always appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic at the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, and on September 29 the writer Frido Mann attends a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed: He wants to personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without a limit".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war ridicules every humane idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between the rich and the poor to the radical change of work through digitalization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "Free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to search for solutions or at least partial solutions."

Karl Marx's birthday will soon be expected by one of the more visitors of the direction of the critique of capitalism, the others rather of a tendency "from outside the left to the center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Both suitable for adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner preoccupied himself with gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeled) woman and the (feeled) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
This is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes to the end of the movement to speak, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner, that some might have wished for a solo.
That was also true, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, as it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought in a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes if he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates this: What would have emerged from Mozart's composition if "the Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" to the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was big applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not take any additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as to one in Wolbeck.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain Chief Executive Officer at the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but has to give the chairmanship of the Board of Directors.
Musk also agreed to pay a double-digit million penalty with the US stock exchange supervisor SEC, as the SEC reported.
Background is Musk's surprising announcement of August to take Tesla off the stock exchange.
In its complaint, SEC accused Musk of having provided false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
10 passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
They were all released from the hospital by now.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night to observe.
He was released during the day, said a police spokesman.
The cause of the long-distance bus accident at Bruchsal was still unclear.
The long-distance bus was unbraked in front of a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG barely retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems with the third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has scored too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them," says ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
The focus at the end was missed by his team this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost until the end a delay, lying at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) at the back.
Only towards the end did the broader bank of the hostesses become decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement back room on the left, which then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top match at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The Blue-Whites won 3:1 in the second-league VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out," said coach Dominik Münch, happy after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the downfall of the table leader.
The guests dominated the first passage almost as they liked it.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-champion of the previous year.
Food took over in the two bars, but it didn't come into play.
We've been very busy with her.
Our opponent hit at high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen changed the assumption to three-way bars.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked up, and we got a little lulled," Münch continued.
At the 18:17 the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their noses in front for the first time.
Although Ostbevern defended four sets of balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt, however, found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," the exercise leader said to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV used the leaf in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly there".
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue and white passage four to their side at 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dirtmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the mosque opening in Cologne has left behind a heap of pieces that can only be difficult to meet," said Gökay Sofuoglu, Chairman of the TGD, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides had missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of working side by side with top German politicians to underline the Muslims' belonging to Germany, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes," lamented Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "strengthened many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly to the day it is then a year ago that we performed a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I didn't think our folk meeting would be in Nottuln so fast.
No matter if Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of Amtmannei was always full.
"As always, the program at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer pledged with his accordion for the first Folktreff "birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring Steinfurt district, which played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" enthusiastically sent the listeners home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there in good time.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, said Linde on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar merger is still subject to permits in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
Most recently, the chances of an insider's approval had improved because Linde agreed to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state care was celebrated with a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall.
On 29 September 1893 the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, he was called "Kulmbach City and Land District Fruit Building Association" by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually about fruit-growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment era, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said district governor Günter Dippold in his keynote speech.
Fruit trees were to line highways, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the conveying of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
"The youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with landlord Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides", added Landrat Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left Kreissführer und Fachberater Friedhelm Haun no doubt about it.
He guided the many visitors through the long history of the Kreisverband with a picture lecture and reported among other things on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, it was fed for winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," argued the expert for fruit and nut trees.
For this reason, there is an incentive for horticultural associations not to slacken, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also included welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian Federation.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which is what we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the towerwinds of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Secretary of State moves UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister would not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she focused on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the United States.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a new version of the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are to be completed by Sunday evening (local time), Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the U.S. Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a stabbing attack, left the hospital.
According to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo", the extreme right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the street during an election campaign in South Brazil at the beginning of September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations mobilized racist and misogynistic statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
Although the "Trump Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, it is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first round, there will be a final election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this success - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known to be instigating homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing workers' party should be shot.
Europe takes back Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale at the gates of Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favourite defending champion USA around a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days in Le Golf National with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen informed on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on his deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music stars like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "street boy" who "was against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed on the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 2010.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: volume at compressed air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure from three other bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of stage fright.
Afterwards the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly inspire the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visibly.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince at the beginning of the concert evening also with the latest, unknown pieces from own pen and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the performance.
Although "addition" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not just hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenzorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used for "Here We Stand" in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost balladish "Take Me Home" captivates by changing from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and inaudible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets his own accents in conjunction with the band with the only coverted song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound that feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheered solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain amount of volume is of course part of the genre at such a hard rock concert: the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing console team, is about 98 decibels at the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition".
This is for example at compressed air hammer level, but is thus still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", to which "The Ignition" on their website point.
However, the Ahlener audience does not need 120 decibels in jet drive volume as usual with the annual Metal-Stelledichein in the north of the Republic.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and set off a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, can say in the end.
And above all enjoy the big applause of the visitors.

A dead person in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed at the airport on the fairground.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" also reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a one-seater.
The plane was already on the approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a marquee at the airport.
But since this weekend, an Oktoberfest has been taking place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr towns and directly at the entrance to the 52 motorway.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US President of North Korea's leader Kim is quite well-conceived despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made his colleague a true declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has become known for a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although the nuclear disarmament wrestling around North Korea proves to be quite tough chunks.
"I was tough, he was tough, too, and we went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection had also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announced stop of all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have seen little more than lip service.
The US president seemed quite aware that the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - for his martial threatening gestures - could not be for everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But he cares very little, Trump explained and then pointed his index finger to the crowd: "I have always told you it is so easy to be presidential".
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this bulging arena, but we'd only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric as well as pampered by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair Baesweiler's city center has dressed up on Sunday.

Refugees rescued thanks to video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya and thus enable them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal city of Savija in July under life risk and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger according to his own statement.
One of his associates had been beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They all beat us with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the program, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via cell phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the situation in Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher contacted the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Perpetrator description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in Middle Franconia after he had stuck the car away from all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon, not far from a pasture, and rescued the missing person since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
According to the report, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road vehicle across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Lashet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned according to his own statements the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns above all the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and religion.
He had therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to become normal in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
Laschet also mentioned the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Mr Erdogan had then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri demands Washington's approval.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula in the UN general debate.
"The recent stalemate is that the US is building on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea to "knie" is "a dream of people who don't know us".
However, in order to build trust, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
From the US side, however, there had been no "corresponding reactions", the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone had adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been urging the United Nations to strictly comply with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
Trump had met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time in June.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing of it: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the nasty surprise came: a power failure had put the huge, two-part fridge out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start over again: although we had a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to make it on their own," Westbuer said.
And that's how they all got involved.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Better cooks can't," praised one visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Reverend Frank Beckmann, while wizard Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other feats.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW of the board
Out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his position in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice-Chief of the NRW-Tafeln, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
Too many fell in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Tabern-Landesverband NRW, spoke to the dpa of understanding for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism had taken Sartor away.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table was doing that."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen board - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday", Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
One should not take the approach, "without us people in the city starve to death".
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not participate in a congress of the Tables on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet shudder," he said.
There are all these social fuzzi that criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch miss 2:0 tour - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sport friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen was quite different: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly got in the back with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to achieve a 3-0
Gladbach playfully two-time tour - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) In the first five league matches, Schalke has maneuvered away four times with early counter goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had finished first behind Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the Heimequipe in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Evgeni Konopljanka with his head, and subsequently the hosts conserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had traded for Bayer Leverkusen with a 0-2 backlash until the break, but in the second half it came to the 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63. minute, with another doublette in the final phase (86/94.) ensured the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart was also the first victory.
Against the Werder Bremen, already decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious throw-in gate that helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not have a fully successful, but also failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
With the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, the Gladbachers gave a lead twice, played 2:2 and are still waiting for an away victory in the VW city since 2003.

Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as well as at the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
In the storm of the foals, Alassane Pléa appears to be a Goalgetter.
The third time in a row and the seventh time in a row, the French record purchase came against Wolfsburg by the OGC Nice.
After seven laps Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable location.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first goal in the season.After 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: 23-year-old Serb collected yellow-red after a tricot swab against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremers back to the game with a curious throw-in goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters back to the Siegesstrasse in excess.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0 sovereignly for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already put the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens vote on whether the name of their country should be changed to North Macedonia.
With a yes, the almost three decades of simmering conflict with the neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked Macedonia's approach to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and hurt them partly severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted at 10 p.m. on Friday in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they approached the accused, who with his fists clenched on passers-by and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officers.
A short time later it turned out that the suspect had beaten three older ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop on Währinger Straße shortly before.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematoma, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also severely injured "for unknown reasons", as it was said by the police.
He was taken to hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the word "yes" on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered partnership had not come into question for her.
"If we get married, it's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with an angry speech on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "tolling" herself on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Bürgervereinigung Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leprakunde.
About 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Citizens' Association.
And there were a lot of things that had accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
The hedge had already been shaved in the spring.
The breakfast that always follows the work has also been a long tradition.
"Everybody should keep their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoeslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canoeslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old took a perfect run on the Olympic circuit on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already enough rides here on the facility and it was all right today," said London's Olympic third in 2012.
In the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and raised both arms in a win-proof manner - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had number four.
But the six remaining starters could not beat his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting reports the first attempt to break into a family home this fall.
Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of.
So yesterday the police inspection Gauting reported the first attempt at burglary this autumn.
It is thanks to the alarm system that it remained when trying to stay at the family house on Königswieser Straße.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they took refuge without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Broke at Hertha: Catched up with reality: Bavaria challenged against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want to be "fallen" by FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small performance-delle under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the Munichers to the greater autumnal low.
"A week ago they still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we have a little bit of reality," Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is really annoying and that's why we're gasping towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal was scored, like at the same time of the preseason two mandatory games in series without victory, the lead in the Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful pin-stitches over the outside have delivered within three days two blueprints, as the last overpowering Bavaria can be cracked after all.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," Kovac emphasized.
Otherwise, however, he handled his losers in his native city surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again flawed handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would, however, make the first interim conclusion of his term positive before the inter-country break - otherwise the tone should probably get worse.
Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second top-class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the brief preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax begins as planned, which had also been defeated by AEK Athens with 3-0 at the start.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again", announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Just like after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The defender of the right appeared in the role as a Mahner.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the variety of chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians were even behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich was at least positive with a wink that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB Boss in Shot Line: Özil-Causa: Sharp Attack from Erdogan to Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the union line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for interpretational sovereignty in the permanent dispute topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the way the former world champion in Germany was dealt with at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association line.
In the early Sunday morning, the Grindel personally attacked by Özil in the Mainz ZDF "Sports Studio" announced consequences from the causa.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again explained that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as your president, I couldn't digest the fact that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, contrary to Özil, he felt "reasonable treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with Erdogan through photos of the two.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - I can't.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, that's what I used to say.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team either.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is to be appointed as the conclusion.
"If one without a migrant background is clearly involved in society and football and says: "The issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauter Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personal data since the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who would have left the road and hit a lead post.
In response, the man did not want a police force on the ground and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has moved to his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and has rammed a construction vehicle at the turning point.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and couldn't remember much of it.
The damage amounts to approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 troops are still in operation.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still engaged in the firefighting work.
That's what the Bundeswehr said on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop, according to a speaker, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been resolved, which was proclaimed a week earlier on September 21 because it was feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements by wind and spark flight.
On Thursday, it was said that an attack of the fire on adjacent communities would no longer threaten.
At times, more than 1500 forces on the ground tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus engineers.
The smoke flag of the moorfire had occasionally moved up to a hundred kilometers far beyond the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to set up a contact point to receive claims.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the word "yes" on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered partnership had not come into question for her.
If we're getting married, it's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with an angry speech on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "tolling" herself on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.

As a means of pressure, Athens had for almost three decades blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote in favour, they will also give the start to their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30th.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner from 1986 dies in the USA in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available if required by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still - as in Germany - only be removed with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
According to Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation, 15 percent of Swiss people are expected to have a donor card.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the family does not know the deceased's wish.
"You will then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Ever.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - per or contra organ donation", she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered as an organ donor, unless he or she disagreed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church refuses to do so.
14-year-old student is world champion in head calculation
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in calculating his head.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg he prevailed against 39 fellow fighters.
This is what Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as main arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenceslas Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was already present in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old at that time.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
"Calculation can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-based computing competitions.
One of the disciplines is the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because they learn to calculate their heads more intensively and with other effective methods in their early childhood.
Urgent Appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's About Early Breast Cancer Recognition
Tennis Ace Serena Williams shows off from her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to point out breast cancer and to promote early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of this.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project that deals with early breast cancer detection, which can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexi's Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "Symbols Act" in review.
The aim is to significantly extend the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the west next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it was said.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the low-forested federal state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree- and shrub-peckers are "walder-set" and for many animals and plants the last retreat-rooms.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Association Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Dane King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: the dense, intertwined demarcations could develop through "knicking" the branches.
Today, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by around 7000 species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of kink and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he becomes a light row of trees, which in addition to biodiversity also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichovsky.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Knickpflege may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on site
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami yourself?
No, I was in Jakarta at the time on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
Since I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners run around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information provision on the island going?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people they don't know if they are alive and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but on the road to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many people thought, "Okay, no tsunami," and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must for a long time renounce Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had contracted a muscle fiber crack in the rear left thigh at 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football club announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following international break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast of downtime.
A muscle bundle rift usually heals within six to eight weeks, and a muscle fiber rift usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián, the annual round of the most prestigious European festivals ends.
Despite all the songs on the cinema, we can sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Hollywood Oscar candidates, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action lasted for some time.
Even a boat was deployed.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olchinger See noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back on land, where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman with a courageous grip after almost an hour.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard picks up World Cup medal
==References====External links==*Official website
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up on the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang to grab the medal.
Seven tenths of a second were missing in bronze at the end.
"I deliberately took the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up on the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
One day you'll have to strike.
The World Cup-Loipe in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbospeed
Time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is very limited.
With a turbo-tempo FBI investigation, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the judge candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial about coercion charges.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama about Kavanaugh's vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing with Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer launched angry tirades against the opposition democrats, the Senate's Judicial Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultous scenes, his party friends consented.
President Trump, who had described the heavy reproaches on Thursday as "shit," initially abstained from further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, final doubts could be cleared up, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats because they reject Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One would specifically investigate the well-known accusations of two women, that's all, one government representative told the Wall Street Journal, "They're not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar set up in a "civil vehicle" by the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1st, according to the municipality.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our penalty room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blues still managed to bring the close 1-0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first win of the season under roof and subject.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given Tedesco safety: "In total, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing", the head obviously played an increasing role with increasing playing time.
Don't actually create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore keep retreating.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man-made."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start at the beginning and make a firework out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can be happy for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest drawback of the afternoon: King's blue missed it, rather to worry for clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From a distance of about two kilometres, a hiker in the Leitzach valley observed a fire on Sunday around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out police and fire department: An unknown person had burned garbage on a two square meter area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, he seemed to have monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling apart and deleting.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Before them stands the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and one or the other joke, he brings one of the most conflicting topics closer to the listeners: migration and integration.
Why are there increasing conflicts despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table is German society, at the cat table is the first generation of migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to play a part.
That leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether to classify oneself politically right or left, but rather: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
In the beginning, the discussion starts with a more and more active attitude.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is on equal footing.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, was intensively discussed.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn finished the first match day of the Bundesliga (BBL) with a home win and an away win.
Gießen won a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won with 86:79 (49:47) at the BG Göttingen.
After the 112:55 gala on Saturday, Alba Berlin will be the first leader of the season against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former serial champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich had already struggled on Friday to a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality is completed on more favourable terms and prices, similar to the previous local model.
According to Frick, more than 100 applications were received.
"The documents are currently being checked", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Mayor of Plien, the aim is to have the applicant ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
Thereafter, the award could be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with expected eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads are to be paved.
A single plot as well as two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of the land on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as an affordable living space.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
On the surface of the new Landsham-Süd area, housing for about 200 people is roughly estimated.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new day care facility is taking place there.
It will accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "big sport" on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting team: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in a row had not sat in the Schalker startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-meter-large Brazilian had once really spoken of the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and the head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom everyone simply calls Naldo, joined in and said: "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his re-reservist existence, had no grudge whatsoever.
Presumably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker in the past season, knows that he did not get on the parking track with his coach - but for good reasons gets a break.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll tell you the truth," Tedesco told me about the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't on the starting team.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breather at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which was finally caught by Naldo.
And to which the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself an exemplary team player at the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at 46.7 points at a 37-month low.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood across Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute reported on Monday on its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, the PMI of the euro zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, which means that the index is still below the 50-count mark for the 13th month in a row, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer decreased, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains - in the third quarter at least - the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have fallen as much as they have not since November 2011.
The companies therefore lost jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more sharply in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial enterprises.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are raised.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds in eighth victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel hurried with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship further from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1:0) thanks to two Superstar Neymar hits and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar brought PSG into the lead after 22 minutes and made the finals in the replay time.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) provided the interim 2:0.
Paris was also able to complete the test for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the league, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat this season at the 2-3 in Liverpool.
