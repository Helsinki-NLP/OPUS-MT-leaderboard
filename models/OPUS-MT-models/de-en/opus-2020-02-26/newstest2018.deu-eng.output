Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
It's a lunatic event where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying if maps aren't up-to-date.
Everyone knows this, who had to get upset, because the Auto-Navi indicated a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are far from up-to-date - but this is precisely why very informative.
Especially if you compare them to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urposition sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian survey administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: It was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued to advance the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek like all others.
The comparison earlier/today is most impressive with the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, in 1877.
Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller-piece map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered corridor pieces from the so-called "uptake" from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots do not occupy farmers there anymore - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area is visible north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once imprisoned with delusions.
In 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called madmen.
He also prohibited staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked with the institute for an exhibition.
For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatry hospitals in Germany, has been located there.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
West lies the football field of the TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built, based on the original construction of the asylum, which had been destroyed during bombings during the Second World War.
Marienplatz was listed as "Haupt Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.
The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business buildings and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at Marienhof, where the preparatory work was carried out these days and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line on 5 April 2017.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial picture of today - and fill up the hole at Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Federation for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourins to pay special attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that aim disproportionately at minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also notes a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 percent more often than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People need to be ready to bring bail money or let the relatives know they're traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Pasture fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.
The CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on site.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-Ortsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the right-graben court of the Schwendemann family.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his company, where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Schwarzwaldmilch" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also Chairman of the BLHV of Fischerbach, he described the willow fence project as "elementary important".
I cannot operate profitably on such steep areas.
The grassland area ensures a lot of work, much has to be done with the engine sense.
"We have to fight with the conditions here and with the topography," Schwendemann emphasized.
In 2003 he took over the parental holding and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not run a bio-farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality recognized the importance of the willow fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can continue their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in via the willow fence.
The open area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of €71 500, half was supported by Leader, while a quarter was supported by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left the farmers 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
For Peter Weiß, too, it was clear that "best food is produced here".
The Landscape Maintenance Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
Prerequisite is the presence of a supporting backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the fenced area must not be able to be managed by tractors (over 35 per cent of the area) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbach Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The open area is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to them when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
When Miller Acosta scolded: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, / the miserable apostasy of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "poor waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who stood up to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting in a worn out classical pictorial representation the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this back a long time.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame to the dead world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.
It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbagh has come across something here.
The meaning of the statue is quite a question of perception's point of view.
The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And that's not, of course, the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch should not illuminate the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotsmen were part of the UK team
The UK Athletics Performance Director, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to continue until we figure it out," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And with the guy at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally was great."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total of athletes in the world championship so far was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-range runner Muir leads this way and has set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases also participate in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it a very special thing for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb Podien.
What about my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Do Not Apply for a Public Office If You Can't Accept the Heating of Voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded at the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for this earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzkopf.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Ms., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, when a number of people comment on the same subject, they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in the past if you'd done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest demonstrators and silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous pens beat his lead.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led the Archerfield Links to the finals last year before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it reaches its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place up.
He is an avid advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That really feels special," said the Southport based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on the back ground.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how it went."
With the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) will come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "slightly in time," says Fred Heinze, head of the building yard.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as much is hidden underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road was closed and only the busses were entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," Marvin Kostorz tells us.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was accepted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand-raising in front of the occupation troops.
An existing movement for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated metal roofs, which were converted by rust into various brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined gold and copper to the value of 3.1 billion US dollars.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated USD 78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We are going to lose everything" is stated in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic trends are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mommy [women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address inequalities and violations of rights in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuans gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators started throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the atmosphere was heated up, an order was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they will shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because she was being attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua Police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings came only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and swearing to address the historical maladministration in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be going through," he said.
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5th and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused of "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce infidelity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who reacted by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid that there would be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the mobile brigade of the police to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the responsibility of women, who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report about Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and harassed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shoots," says Gobai, the head of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never be given justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time
A fire found its way through Dubai on Friday in one of the tallest residential towers in the world and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the skyscraper in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and people screamed.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who named his name George Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the firefighting units at 4.00 a.m. local time (00.00 p.m. GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation came.
In the UK, the police said they believed that the plate system could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people at the Grenfell Tower in London in June.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Association (ITF) failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also very much appreciated for this reason, are thus retained in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member states voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was only marginally missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our memberships have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," said Haggerty.
They will continue to work to improve the applications.
It was not until the vote, after many objections, that the proposal to hold the final was made in a neutral place.
New from 2018 onwards are only comparatively smaller details: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items on the plane, a survey finds out
A survey of passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent entering the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers rather disregard the rules.
Of those who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the plane.
The company said that it asked travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many would have done it on purpose.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were the ones who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often insecure about which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could see books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electric thousandsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has insinuated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever more triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time another, less glamorous figure at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has often advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders in total, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US Dollars and in the UK 1000 Pounds) "reservation payment" in full.
Currently there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, admitted Musk in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it should be - all models taken together - 500,000, one million in 2020.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPO Chief Pruitt withdraws due to delaying Obama Era's rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era's rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a federal court of appeal.
It is about a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal in ozone standards would simply reinforce the willingness of the EPO to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through legal proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that exists to us."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt would at some point use his "feelings for delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on sound policies and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to get involved in polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The friends and patrons of Tumlingen have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and the Vogtei on it" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a royal court on Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or patronage right belonged and not vice versa.
So people also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement center of the village.
Old maps from around 1600 underpin this historical situation.
The patronage was created from the early medieval own church law.
A Lord who built, furnished and occupied a church with a pastor remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church.
This was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broke down on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell rang in 1692 for the first time, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower gnome that still exists today remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "creative pensioners" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organisers, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery of the St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, 16 July.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local head Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entry is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the Serenade there is a drink in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and patrons of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants approval of wind turbines tested
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see any legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It had been unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved, since at that time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border of Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
Such zones should prevent "parrotation" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the granted approval notice is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim defends itself".
State of the art: Before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This means that the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning at this point".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Viersen district since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argumentation of the association "Boisheim defends itself".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be met - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-sen households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crashing together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich took her car with her 53-year-old mother as a companion to the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and dealers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The Gewerbeverein and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the city center for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize customers about what offers the own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies with their training places are to present themselves.
In addition, the shops of the city center are to invite to the "Midnight Shopping".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags, which point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
Municipal administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade association and the city are thus entering another stage of the "Attractive City Centre" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest, including Sunday open for sale, discussions with all traders and hosts to get them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be re-exploited or re-exploited.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to invigorating the city centre - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time on the third "home shopping" day in Germany.
Next to Bad Langensalza are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also made it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more have been injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) an injured person was still in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A missing person was later also buried dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of disaster, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls due to payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, called on him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he publicly denounced the Wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US and swore to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia was "laughing", "bad" and "dumb" and that the existence of the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dump" after proposing a ban on resettlement of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Relaunch Racist Lynchakt as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled towards the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle - aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train to his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n-- r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Scream tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene that was played on July 22nd is just a rendition.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience uttered very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really incredible that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the re-enactment.
"It's a dirt stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia Congressman and a life civil rights activist.
For him, the reproduction serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A coroner puts a bedclothe over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of being involved in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch's actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a ruling by the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote in the summer election campaign for the first time.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more concisely.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their presentation is vivid, touching and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or if you don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - rushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He's played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearse their lines.
The play begins with Malcom yelling at Hester and harassing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n-he' back then."
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard R."
And that's where the energy in space shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays' grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you're standing on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy mutters as if he wants to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about the rendition with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words, which feeling left behind the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me think that Lynchen is still going on," she added, "today it's only called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone holds Brook's farm at his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The reproduction is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like, if we don't learn anything from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat them."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also relies on a colorful and frivolous production in front of a gigantic six-story backdrop.
The rotating stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner including the remains of the wall and the Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parked, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind us of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" production.
The three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Oak) must believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humblely bows his hands to Merkel's raute, are celebrated in a stormy manner.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directorial team was eagerly awaited.
Had he had to pass a roaring whistle concert in 2013, there was great cheer five years later, in which the isolated "buh" calls went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner may have been happy about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a certain way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but had also grown in understanding its view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where anywhere?
quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
What are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It's a nice, wide spectrum I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late-time volunteer.
How come?
Quantity: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineer's degree, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on the spot, perhaps also in the focus.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably do a social worker's training at the Herne Youth Office, and study at Hamm University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a little unusual to have several different locations during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partially in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, it was just the right thing to do that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you, each with a completely different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of touch?
Menge: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business
The British educational group Pearson said on Friday that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring program was launched to overcome the pressure the company was facing.
The loss of jobs, which Director General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost-cutting program a cost-cutting plan of another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its investment in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Konvoi attack by Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, a statement from Nato reported.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in Qarabagh District.
The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement states that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "person-carried improvised explosive device".
The statement states that all injured are in a stable condition and treated in the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since the US-led troops displaced the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul over the last few weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO returns decision to delay the smog rule after actions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has abrogated a decision to delay Obama's government's regulation that states are required to contain smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency for taking the action.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so-called "Ozon provisions 2015" and said it showed the agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPO CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to delay by one year until October 2018 the ozone regulations, which are to be measured in one part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda, according to Trump, to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the setbacks of democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of major emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that inhaling air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Community Council wants common space
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the Fluorn-Winzeln municipal council decides to set up a common space in the future senior citizens' housing.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still be time for the area previously owned by the parish to be owned by the parish, there is now no longer any impediment to planning the project that a private investor is planning.
There is a discussion on a common area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a common space not as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior housing, but open into the community.
As an example, the word from the "strick café" went round.
The decision, which was made earlier last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget, is being undermined by the possibility of funding.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.
The establishment of a common space, Tjaden reports, would be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal the investor that he does not want to be thrown between his legs in this respect, provides for the conclusion that both saddle - which is based on the surrounding building - and desk roof - which reduces the height of the trump and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.
If it helps, he'll pass the board in a unanimous vote.
It's not that easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which one can not make any progress, for which one now leans out of the window in the common room, she says: "I am having a hard time with them".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even external investors.
That is not the case, because the purchase of the area does not give a subsidy, but gives a real, in case of doubt marketable equivalent, is the counterword.
Staiger's request to split up the proposal for a decision accordingly finds three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller sums up: "If we take the decision this way, we will make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclists are hurled on the road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike on the road Schwarzer Weg from Hilden at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car guide driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove on the road, he obviously did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He bumped into a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rettug car.
FC Bayern München has to give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let go of the match against Dortmund.
FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the trophy winner.
Before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) the personnel concerns of the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger with cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
In the duel with BVB, coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to do without David Alaba.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, the Munich-based Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin from star to star
The first "Star Trail" is to be built in the Harz region.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the need for information from many visitors to the Harz Mountains, it was said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and sporting performance.
The members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well accessible installations in five to six locations" in Oberharz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be eligible.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the Sternenpfad Zug is to be extended by Zug.
"On the star path, the viewer learns a lot of things worth knowing, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, although it is much further away.
It is also reported in which constellation there is a selected star and when it is best to be seen.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the Bergstädtchen St. Andreasberg since 2014.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can often be seen clearly with the naked eye.
In the university city there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the Planetenweg since 2003 on the initiative of the association Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads with its steles up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality of the likes) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto at the end point degraded to the dwarf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, exactly 75 meters away, measures at least 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's super spring weight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I am a former feather weight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down on lightweight.
And he must move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year, in order to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title match in the forum on September 23rd.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said and later openly expressed himself to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he estimated Lomachenko to be "an enormous fighter," and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-time champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was to show punch strength, then boxing.
They both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured after tyre burster
In the event of an accident on the A7 four people were injured in part on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the junction Marktbreit, probably after a tyre seater.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed for about an hour to the north, after which the traffic could be passed by the accident site on the left lane.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Threesome chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue will score points after the 2:2 start of the season against Braunschweig.
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, if there had not been the two goals against Braunschweig.
"That was two counter goals too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the defenseman of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the three-way chain is also to be further optimised.
And a goal after a free kick the Fortunes don't want to catch themselves anymore.
"For the future it will be the case that nobody stands on the line next to Michael (Rensing) anymore."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the three-way chain even after the experience in the preparation, than with the four-way chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build well on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann in the chain of three," said Hoffmann.
"It is necessary, but that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in the construction."
Of course Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw doesn't know.
The performance could be quite okay," said Hoffmann.
"But if we can stand there on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I do not judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of playing," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climb favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know where they are at the moment, 100%," says Fortuna's internal defender.
The guests from the Rhineland, as an easier favourite, will go to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started to carry out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We don't see much difference in statistics over the past few months, the numbers are quite constant," he said to The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his or her age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "propose that the person examined is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in plan
The work on the three bridges on Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Freiburg Government Bureau.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has become old.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge attachment, which is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run on it.
The special feature is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special sensitivity has required the laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
In the run-up to the work, local residents were informed about the project through handbills.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collection consecration in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a single-lane traffic light.
For the construction of the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach, the road is fully closed in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is €700,000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Protest with German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district congress (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance which on that day peacefully shows flag because the AfD invites Rondell to the "big campaign start" in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle.
And well-known names bring to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
It's a colorful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers, is really happy about: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and plenty of food, including a "original German potato salad that the AfD could eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, and it shows a presence especially at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has made an effort for such an event and has been awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but had received a cancellation there, because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking spaces were available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
That's what it does: At around 8 p.m., a band on the Rondell forecourt provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle various speakers, among them the Rheinland-Pfalz-Chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weiel, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to give her speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but there is also a call to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can bridge - no special occurrences.
Trombone meets trumpet
A reunion with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or also "Balkan Folklore" meets a classical German training with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo pianist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new dress, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazzecho Prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing merge into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core of the programme was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously involved in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'"
The most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed it.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered particularly from this, but in school when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I was gonna look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'."
Especially to the public, they don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself to the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement earlier at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying, "The change of Governor Justice's party is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and the control of the fewest legislative entities in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that has no leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, agreeing message," said RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
The world's head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated into sport.
During the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, Russia's Head of Athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said that the banishment of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snatched away from gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re-designed."
Coe said he was also "joyed" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the moment to re-establish Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which start on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Tragedy for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, some 1000 people of the two soldiers died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements.
On the unexplained cause of the crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the two killed pilots as "coons of her profession".
"We bow to this supreme sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Chief of Staff from Northern Hesse were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a wake of the Bundeswehr were taken to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At midday, only the family left the church.
Afterwards the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politicians.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in service.
The captain of the staff had built up the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also explained: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, no one would have been able to do so."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That's what the royal house said on Thursday.
The Danish royal couple are traditionally buried in the Cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the message continued.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title of "Prince's Wife".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish royal family.
Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will be, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for in the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, he met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Thames at the French Embassy.
During his later wife the expressions of sympathy of the people always flowed, Prince Henrik in his almost 50-year-old reign with the Danes had a difficult standing.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "Just a few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who have a reputation in this country for being the brand of social-critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid reelection
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday we voted in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Prior to this, the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from her parliament in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained in Hanover on Friday.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that it be included.
CDU and FDP therefore have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Grüne 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag resolves its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its next step on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag withdraws the confidence of the Prime Minister and elects a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be properly assessed in law," said Thümler.
"Every question will be discussed calmly, if it is legally soundly examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but somewhat curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She referred to herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the apostate MPs to return their Landtag mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her Landtag mandate, which she has received from the Green List, with immediate effect," state leaders Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner informed.
Green Group leader Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret the decision of Elke Twesten".
She had deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of red-green," wrote the Federal Chief of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag quickly re-elected.
The withdrawal of Twestens costs the majority of Red-Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil "in her hurt vanity and frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country".
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this filthy intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 Landtag elections with personal career thinking.
The CDU was at that time the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Interview with Minister of Agriculture - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed with the editorial network Germany (RND) and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Food Warning.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance officer is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately closed and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of the concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe for health.
When eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg, they are not fit for circulation.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it's not the factory's fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production plants are not directly responsible.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or of coherent competence?
It was just the official controls that exposed the operation.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handing over to the prosecutors' offices are of crucial importance in cases where criminal offences may exist.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The splintered product has brought manufacturers, traders and consumers into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the production of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to be able to clarify the facts quickly and completely.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint Germain.
Some consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, because the leading organization that has supervised the European game the power to ban teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to counter with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the club's debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And even though Platini fell into disrepute from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to advocate deterring excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption amount of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not accept this as a legitimate income.
This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become the World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy for the UEFA regulators to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns an association, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline re-orders the order.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red-white-packed schoggie boards distribute 14 grams per year to passengers before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is more important: for a Schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Since 2006, Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be spoiled with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class passengers Schoggi from Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes in the short distance, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion fights for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup competition and could only look at the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-Grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults playing adults now, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the watering can principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character wanders through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-bossy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's underbelly beard of "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series, until he achieves what I assume to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose final scene the gang will show how she will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-against-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-sock Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the Voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it goes there, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef visit the American embassy again and again, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a lie.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Attack on drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutor's office Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects.
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the project.
A total of over 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crimes, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the Procuratorate of Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors' offices in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Rottweil hospital had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
For this reason, the large-scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused mainly on Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to be a part of the gang's account.
Weise complains big gaps in the foreigner register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has considerable shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Weaknesses in the data registered there could lead to "some serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis that the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" has submitted.
According to the register, 10 million people of foreign nationality are recorded, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore".
"Errorous data input can slow down return processes considerably," the report continues.
The statistics on people who are obliged to leave the country also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave the country.
Such false assignments, however, led to "a distorted debate about the handling of those obliged to leave", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government apparently began to send refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they entered from there.
This is reflected in an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "with respect to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state, which they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
The office now writes on the grounds: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children has increased significantly in Italy".
Italy had provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send back refugees under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, the spokesperson for the left-wing party in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened with unacceptable reception conditions and child welfare due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from persons living in Oberreichenbach has already been provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday.
First of all Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the local council, the congregation appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our bodies are designed to do this, and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood to strangers," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the circle of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the canned food is decomposed into its components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK Head of the Circle.
Obviously, the change to the theater house a few years ago led to higher attendance numbers.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger account for half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter paid ten times every 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sustainable" when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure.
The policy makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) voted at 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that in the next few years, interest rate increases would be necessary to curb Brexit-fuelled inflation, and it said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut economic package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper finance to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this system - with £115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household incomes continues to burden consumption."
With regard to interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool down inflation and a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "stepwise" and "limited".
The Bank's downward revised growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision will not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations for an interest rate increase and the GDP in the second quarter has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The recent Inflation Report showed little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases, as the tightening will first get worse before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income drop over the next few years, but she added that wages will "clearly recover" at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to fully achieve this.
Prior to the Bank's last ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike had increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and that it would pick up again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its 2% target was "completely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are looking loudly for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing deals and close new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, will now be delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal last year confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed as "important new intervention" by NHS England boss Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before being introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in patients at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is available in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Among those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study will assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delay in implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help to bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the big life: mezzanine floor and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment at Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's Duck & Shed architectural and design studio from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, it was about putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses from Joanne.
Through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It is counterweight, so when you push the door up, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the land size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing due to good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul's property worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The cost increases in this case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both-party law firms.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "high school in my last years when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and $26 million on leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "have become bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has held back a lot, although he was a former AFL board member and, after a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say, "I really can't say much," because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pass our surname through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution".
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts," wrote Colin.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior executives on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that got into the President's hands.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions that could be convinced," former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that without their interventions, Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets Trump hasn't sent.
If his associates have managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, made up of competing parties, keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - completely concerned with this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened to find out where they come from.
This was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy staffwoman Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he has in the past made false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tryed to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a Priebus manager, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are naturally unknown, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
On Friday, Europol reported on the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives are hiding in holiday destinations, says Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online wanted could be arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to references after the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the Millionaires series
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are back at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a trench drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy road from Solihull, called the "Millionaires Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters with them after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a trench excavated by the Council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the advice of Solihull, who said that it is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless when dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A local resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokesperson for the Solihull Council said, "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the Solihulls police, taking the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays were lost each year and revenues were also generated by the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation to the Landratsamt in the face of dramatically rising numbers of refugees who came to the county, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at the time.
But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the house even then.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were torn out, blankets partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much work to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything was to become "beautiful close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to be wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He had already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The city's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
When asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Just under a million euros, he calculates.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to front, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury according to a report.
In recent weeks, the board has started work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper assessed the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
For some time now, US intelligence has accused the Kremlin of engaging in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the election campaign.
More and more Trump's private and business environment has been reported to have been examined by Mueller.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that special investigator Trump has personally put the spotlight on the accusation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine available evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to prosecute.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictments.
Most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called on by the public prosecutor's office to invite persons under oath for questioning.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former campaign leader Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on U.S. television that the installation shows that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it did not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would be involved in the end in order to decide on the imposition of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives the democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
But they usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House endorses any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president was not being investigated.
There was no reason to believe that this had changed, the statement went on to say.
However, Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Allegations against Trump had been made that he had tried to interfere with the judiciary.
In June, Comey testified to a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure from the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.
This triggered speculation as to whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president's urging from the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed as easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has broken away from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than one trillion tons and measures 5800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years until it melts.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
He doesn't assume a danger to people.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice-shelfs in the region for some 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken-off colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Shelfeis so far.
Shelf ice swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen-C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and abortion was disturbed a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes that a complete shelf ice has collapsed there.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting of ice and iceberg does not increase sea level as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow away much faster than before.
This could potentially increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
The Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, according to AWI data, with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary from Swansea University, UK.
"This is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
It is controversial among scientists whether the Larsen-C-Shelf ice will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the destruction of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades a great many ice-shelfs of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has fallen by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the fastest-growing areas in the world.
CDU wants house rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU calls for the employer's association to quit in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the Kreistag waved 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have completed their first working day.
The teaching positions at the circle seem to be highly sought after.
Around 620 applications were submitted for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the district of Mettmann.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and counteract the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for recruiting and developing personnel".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-country entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known in the past.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is therefore high time to act, so that there are no more vacancies.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU's political group, goes further than the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a faust-thick surprise in the Kreistag, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost capping and astonished the other parties.
Peoples want to be reviewed for all possibilities that allow them to leave the local employers' association.
"If we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should aim for a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns and cities of the district," says Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the public service tariff system actually provides.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed; increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level that is oriented towards career years.
But the circle's tasks have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, district councillor Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet', because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in a statement on social media.
"We can only judge all the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Rescue', the IUVenta, since October.
It is assumed that its crew will take on board dinghy migrants who will be delivered directly to them by traffickers and that smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was reported to have taken place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, in particular, an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve "essential changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Physicians Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burg- und Weinfest von Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
There followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains.
In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point ran to the vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days there were again many altitude meters.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and retreat huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed healing brine in the open air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest at its best - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the wind and weather to fight over the stadium grass?
The fact is: E-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.
This is also recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was made in 2015 by VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says Managing Board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure "that there's still a lot of clubs on this train."
On the following weekend, FIFA is organizing the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that the young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be present online much more often in these markets than to send the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is this about?
In e-sports, computer games like "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are fought at competition level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse, too, has long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
However, it also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Checks are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.
The scientist emphasizes positively the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players are travelling internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros had thus been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, turnover is expected to be 130 million.
This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, the e-sports are "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", writes the Deloitte advisors.
Internationally, many countries are already further.
Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There are also some things happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, Dutt says that the first-level football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In a European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia and to transfigur the old days is no longer enough.
The aim was to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," Dutt also says.
"You can't hold on to the fact that everything stays the way it used to be in football."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal over poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts that force Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years suspended on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes facing down when she was condemned.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, has a significant influence on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that "there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all the pain we will bear with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was being "tracked" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having this only person I've been with since I was born every day is a pain that I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's textual messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention from Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, commented in the Los Angeles Times, "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lamb of FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete as captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner to have a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, that Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since there was of course no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup, he made the tie assigned to him hold on to his arm.
"The coach did not announce it," the Confed Cup winner told afterwards, after his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the debut could have been better than the 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But Kimmich could also interpret the sign from the coach.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf, which was made up of youth players, debutants and just out of vacation professionals, but he.
The best way to distribute sugar is to give it to those whom you trust a lot, who want to keep them happy.
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of lameness can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew across the field as a mini-loam.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on the arm did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich seemed like the one in this starting formation who could take the rudder in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unheard-of troupe.
He had the view for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal overplayed his lack of fitness (he barely clapped); Renato Sanches with it, on the devil come out to build on the achievements of the Asia trip (was also limited); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with it, in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey not to be noticed negatively.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The Napoli storm, which had been occupied by Napoli, was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build up the game a few times successfully.
His colleague, Rudy, admitted that the result was "not as we hoped".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Shifting the game, changing the tempo: "I was also brought for this style".
How unusual this Bavaria world is for the new arrivals, one saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but certainly gave six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
In Bavaria you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new guys that anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer has registered via Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern-Legionär is almost club-mate of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck and is feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
Perhaps our ladies could use the famous Bavarian shower too.
Company satisfied with Rheinland-Pfalz Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trierer Unternehmen Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a plan determination process, and construction law will be in place by 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the western bypass of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport infrastructure plan.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says Minister's spokesman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost for supporting regional but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aims, as suggested by Wissing, at a Rhineland-Palatinate wine label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports which have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros for the passed master's exam and 2500 euros is foreseen if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts can be quickly created, but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Out of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wissing at the national company Mobility, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, which in 2017 and 2018 invest more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Furthermore, the existing broadband expansion in the country is sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the grid supply in an IHK survey with the grade 3.4.
They complained about staggering Internet connections and crashes.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits on the board of directors of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke for April in order to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she already cleared the field again due to inconsistencies.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi announced, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based, to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as recalling them.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of tying up the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but back in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were accused, while others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in engine development at Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emission regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message made the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join in, a raft travels through Munich tomorrow, which has a special message.
If it moves to the Isar again on Saturday, there will be a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
It's the building department that wants to clear up.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river is to sharpen.
Last summer, the raft sailed over the Isar River and this year, too, there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's tuber noses and the laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon artists, the tuber noses of his characters are his trademark.
The Argentinian still draws with 85 and is working on a film.
His message: laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he worked out as an artist for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost in my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures roam in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own statements, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-feet as an opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is to be released on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he prefers the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence threatened with climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-borne insects, causing severe headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Kramers, guilds, merchants, vagants or a Landsknecht camp are to be experienced in the city center on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa State through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office, which was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico's chaos dangerous.
There is no pause from violence, and while the bodies are piled up throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter are her editor and her inspiration for Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we don't trust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the provincial capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to conduct journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish hard-hit investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid one.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dockman, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "feel a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. Days before, it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are in fact under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best-informed source of the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body texture.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez office was re-dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protested against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning about another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Journalists throughout the country have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gain international support for the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they were telling the truth.
Since then, she has asked for it to be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "encapsulated" by organised crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by order of politicians and security forces who were covered with organized crime.
Last year, the media watchdog group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipa six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel, "Here I am for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, Riodoce's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were crying up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who were holding guard to see if they were on standby.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you even remember to close," said Bojorquez, "when the intern asked me to send her to the street to report on the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a "unsettled past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy clumps of the earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink your eyes a little, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with armor and resembles a walking tank, it is likely that this herbivore has been threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made its first headlines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully exposing it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter-shadowing, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today's animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by sufficient pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shadowing - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this nodosaur was exposed to a real battle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous Age must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of his life, including his preserved intestinal contents, to find out what he ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just smile a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's asleep."
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted down by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that protruded from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as 'rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.'
In the thunderstorm: Mass carbulation on A8: many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carbide situation.
There are many injured, miles of traffic jams and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass carbide in the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police at about 5 p.m., almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were crashing into each other during a thunderstorm between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg county).
At first, no information was available on the exact number of injured.
It is mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large range of ambulances was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre-long backlog formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the counterroad - by numerous Gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the registration plates of the vehicle handlebars, which now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m. there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing suspects you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you're deep into your work and you just have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
If the conductor comes and wakes you up, or pulls the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket check.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the uncreated ticket control.
You just confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and devalue the ticket.
Currently there is a test operation on two lines.
"If the offer arrives, we'll expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany early next year," said a rail spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" is the name given to the train to cancel tickets without a conductor.
In order to be able to use these, however, some requirements have to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do.
You also have to use the DB Navigator app that DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.
Train attendants will receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to place Y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, work, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This makes it possible for passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, marketing board member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest nuisances.
Because you often have yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travellers not all the documents that you need to depreciate online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket, and at the end the conductor takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How an activist got to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born woman was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled through a mail from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," they said.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was outstretched on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She dropped off her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, carrying a sign saying, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"It's not common," Ferrell recalled.
"This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and can call typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, they discussed a conversation that they had "about the black experience and the black condition" countless times before this morning.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only to know activism and organization, but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman's child.
I feel that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a place across from the police department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-crime from Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field who is known for his activism around death row inmates.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are portrayed, because this is how I will be represented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black gay women must bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held upright by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence that she was on the front line because there's so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on parole for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
From "dream" to "major madness": TV readers discuss about bit gallery
The bit-gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Coldly, the subject hardly leaves one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit-gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Doesn't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Größenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the Bauernmarkthalle stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and that to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the Bauernmarkthalle almost every week for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women very much.
We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, too.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
But this is not likely to be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "What about shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that unnecessary.
There's already enough of this in our town.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no special shops anymore and what is left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit in with me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all, where should the Bauernmarkthalle go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost bit-gallery manage to drive out all the shops from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "This is just not going to work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmer's market hall thanks to the insanely many - I think - useless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the Bauernmarkthalle is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear."
A matching resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making public classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A Matching Similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a trans-wife and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, created a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formality of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly talking about identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning is visibly unwell in a driver's seat and wears a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stubs and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the trash to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which anticipated a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas only a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning showing up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the United States disciplinary barracks like King-Kong.
"If they freeze your speech, they won," they say.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets me from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulakras, which gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the files of the Cook County District Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.
A community alert system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives investigate the stabbing as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been on leave and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the UK police and willing to help the U.S. investigation agencies in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip saying something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and researching a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA timetable in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the Roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the Organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria on the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said, "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit something that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded by WADA from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was moving "in the right direction" in order to be reinstated.
Aldi doesn't sell eggs for now
This was reported by the groups of companies.
The communication stated that it was a mere precaution that no health impairment could continue to be assumed.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negative for anti-lover containing fipronil.
Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees' luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the trial.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which at a glance shows which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can re-drill why.
Companies come to realize that they need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118,7 billion in 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments financial website.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in discredit earlier this year in the middle of the Uber case.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send custom "pulses" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took time for the "social media to come to their right" that companies realized that they couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they have been up to now.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are committed and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and commitment, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow employees ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of it?
And if you don't take care of it, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, says Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bonding of workers in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's going to 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA trainings should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood did practical exercises.
They are scheduled to do 18 exercises during August 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA's change of rule, even if it adds another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they're still piling on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will stop its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight in its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been thrown with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a gate post.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then preparing to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party fact reviewers and then display their results under the original post, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact reviewers who may display results of the fact check from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany is supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to finding out which stories are being challenged by third party fact reviewers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature for the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, little Scotney Castle was shown in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time they lit a fire for the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself were there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overrated my welcome greeting a little") this all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent its days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive he described as "hundreds of years when aristocrats said, "Oh, throw it to the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.
Boys, let it all go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.
Maybe the two of them are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome boys, with a talent to advertise heiresses."
After the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf veiled
With the envelopment of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand on Friday.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there is to be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?", ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (of course!)", they write on their website that was unlocked yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action was about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point".
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-digit amount of its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
This week, too.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister's headquarters.
The five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs have now also taken part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government.
So the civilians in the YAS were outnumbered.
The government's pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the navy were deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
A total of 486 people, who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, have been being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt a "God's gift" because he gave him the opportunity to "fully cleanse" the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uneasiness in Military Headquarters".
In the General Staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifested itself among other things in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, the big clean-up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals used to be the real masters of the country.
Three times they couped on their role as guardians of the worldly state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least in line with the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is actively promoting the Islamicization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" an officer, who was not named, warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad.
If that is true, such a development could not leave Nato cold.
Without a doubt, after the purges, there is doubt in the alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army to take action.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US spends green cards to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the Rennsteigshuttle has been discussed over and over again - now it should go very quickly.
Before the end of the year it is planned to build on the derelict route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteigshuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the track is to begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said Klaus Sühl, State Secretary for Transport on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the line at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered from the country, is currently being finalized, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as operators already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially among tourists.
In the past months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also heavily dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, a new report comes on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we'll see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more disturbing because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, focused on conversation, or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the allusions to rape, when you take a step towards Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, worry you the most.
On his website True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they remain on the brink of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House bragging about sexually assaulting women.
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maid') is not the graphic images, the engulfed bodies and the punctured eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: Maid
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the USA gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's choosing relatives.
We're all supposedly trying to blow up our filter bubbles.
Less has been noticed is Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens won't repel us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right wing Republicans, who suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
Today I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, in fact, appear to be very mild crimes compared to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the clapping music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite through the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option of matching the score with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologizingly grinning while I was tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of incisions on his wrists, which according to the prison authorities, he suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, of which they say she is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the pupils will go to secondary school in the future, four to secondary school in the future.
Headmaster Angelika Sitte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Bürgerhaus in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle as a symbol of the school's leaving, which grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released into freedom.
In addition, the lively crowd performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hünenhof auf".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was shattered, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and vanished.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's study.
The hens danced with the young goblins who wore cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chickens), but belongs to it.
He'll never be like a chicken.
His destiny was to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
This was followed by thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into school shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she was reluctant to release her students, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all students sang a song of summertime and holiday season.
The children had great joy in doing so.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted from television, reported.
On the morning of August 1st, the police arrested a group of illegal camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose substantial fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Those Who Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesels or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheat software," says Anja Smetanin.
The German Motor Transport Agency (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to every person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within the scope of the inspection.
How long should the overall conversions take?
"Heavy to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on the political pressure.
"We have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily on the subject of environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign producers would probably follow suit.
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars now threatening?
The ACE fears that.
But in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will hold a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, announced that he would not participate in the gala.
He said to the "New York Times": "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and this is burdening me."
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The job has already been advertised, but suitable candidates are scarce.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he mediates in the press.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
In view of the regular periods of notice, therefore, there should still be enough time for training.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have the relevant qualifications.
Because the city definitely wants to keep this function.
If it could no longer fill them, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good business climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure about the construction office and its employees.
But diverse projects are also on the agenda in the future: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have started.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium renovation is still the subject.
The latter alone will score around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
There was a great deal of room for manoeuvre for a city builder.
With Haslach's own building yard and nursery, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and citizens and visitors often praise the design of the green areas.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city architect bears high responsibility.
He's a builder, "Everything's over my table in the end."
He can count on long-term employees when it comes to supervision and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Deepbau) has been there for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job."
Because continuity is not only important for a good working environment, but also for the further design of the city.
According to information from the city of Haslach, anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to demonstrate a completed degree as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building regulations and building planning law.
The City Building Authority is responsible for building and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition, administration of the urban properties, municipal farm with building yard and town gardening, as well as Lower Building Law Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South railway line closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so badly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators are based on two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver near the scene.
"This goes far beyond a luscious stroke," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system as well as the minutes of delay and the costs for rail replacement services, the offenders could also receive pönals of the railway customers.
Overall, a "significant" sum can be expected, said the speaker.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried without hindrance.
Nearly ten passenger trains had failed on Friday mornings, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, this may result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequencing and six types of bacteria were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were reared in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milkic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice' feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
With Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's 40 million pound signature began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments.
"Getting three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've done a lot of work."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner into the sky
US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the US, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such an advertisement.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD head, social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no interference from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federation - that was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy Brandt House have watched with growing horror the events in the SPD-controlled state capitals.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in terms of headwinds.
It was low blows.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the Landtag election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Green CEO Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of voters' will.
Elke Twesten must return her mandate immediately," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"All this must not be true," sighs a SPD election fighter, when the new message of Job reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the transition of the Green MPs Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, that's all, calmed down the comrades at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
It then became so - and it became clearly worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to tumbling, the Düsseldorf-Pleite smoothly killed the party.
The comrades struggled hard in the weeks after that.
Then, when they had just regained their courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication after that, which can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and its role on the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been critical for some time.
Poor survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been increasingly trying to put accents in the league in the past few weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden from comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted, as they promised to stabilize the party by Weil.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the party's internal conflict with the Lower Saxony Greens.
And certainly not Schulz.
For the time being, therefore, the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democracy-damaging, as Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the Landlist of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continued.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, complains of an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The voter's will four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local centres III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been renovation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the total funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to also promote internal development, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Karlsruhe Government Bureau had received information that there would be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How, then, does a rehabilitation area develop?
According to Schindler, one will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also played a role in rehabilitating whether there was any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state programme "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per plot.
The redevelopment area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The eligibility period for the grants has run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, by September of this year, the inventory would be carried out, in which the persons involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to complete.
In November or December, if possible, the Statute Decision is to be taken so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the above-mentioned preliminary investigations.
It was a question of assessing urban problems and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A remediation note will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann would come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer vacation.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot sheet", which deals among other things with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment sheet", information on the size, distribution and residents of a living space can be provided.
The blue "business return" shall be completed only if premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "first-round" principle - who comes first, first-rounds.
One could not "reserve" any funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the guests a "tasty" renovation.
British inventor puts himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a £300 surcharge per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine, costs taxpayers up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and White House executives took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at 3:00 p.m. on July 17th, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of duty hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Sounds like you're locked," answered the deputy commander.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the Presidential Airplane provided taxi services against the backdrop of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the Presidential Airplane by its predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn area to drop off the US President at the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to US Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
"Setting the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates of refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a RAND study in 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
Top of the Second Tennis Bundesliga competes in the third round of the S Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the rear positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability of the Suchsdorfer SV, imports from the far north are particularly important.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this is going to be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip to the far north is practical.
His debut for blue and white could be Maxime Janvier.
If the currently still in the Challenger tournament in Biella in Italy does not make it to the Bundesliga game, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in Liberec in the Czech Republic comes to his first bet this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was at the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
However, he was to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump didn't seem really happy when he signed the law on Wednesday night to tighten up sanctions against Russia.
"In his hassle to pass the law," Congress put in a few "constitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming against the US attack.
After all, the proposal envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV have been concerned, which together with other European companies is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea management Nord Stream 2.
The threatening scenery is enormous.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which of the company could ward off and which could really hurt it.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focus of Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season will begin on September 1st.
Roll backwards: the city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the daycare centre itself again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city day care centers, the clock is turned back.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the municipal day care facilities (Kitas) in its own direction.
This is good news for Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Assistance: "We were all very pleased".
Cooking continues to be done outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year of daycare, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for for 45 hours a week are eating lunch in the day care centre," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time staff will have a kitchen service from September 1st: they warm up the delivered food, add salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, deliver the food, clear, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are permanently assigned to a daycare center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-grouped as well as seven-grouped facilities - decides on the range of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more integrated and it is easier for daycare managers to implement pedagogical concepts."
Because that's also what it's all about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful.
Even for the children.
"They have a known power in the daycare, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the day care rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen's performance, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between self-direction and external assignment for the city, according to the Press Office.
And that, even though 46 part-time workers are being re-employed.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be running in the provincial elections. Three women are running for the role of vice-president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was with friends on Kolpingstrasse, at around 14.55 a.m., because they wanted to use the girl's cell phone.
But the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation's under way.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to make sure that managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to experience" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to " express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be advanced."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said, "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a thriving production presence at McVitie."
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to this as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully acknowledge the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this."
Has the PSG warned Barcelona of Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not slow down in her persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago of the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for every club that wanted to have one of PSG's best players signed.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prize offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw over a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused material damage of more than 200 euros to the disguise of the vehicle.
The Schramberg Police Department, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for clues.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came to him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum and his VW were on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the way to Leese.
In the area around the village of Stolzenau, a car came to him on his lane, so that he had to avoid to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
The car was damaged by material damage.
The driver of the accommodating passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Kommissariat in Stolzenau by phone 05761/92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Domspatzen in Regensburg continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regrets about their own omissions or their false assessment of the events at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized the fact that reporting on violence in the cathedral pats was measured by "two measures".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "indecisive and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and preparing public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and that's a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "Schliege was a very normal educational tool" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one."
It would find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with the reports on abuse cases.
Quite wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the commemorative volume "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all of this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report, which Ulrich Weber, the lawyer commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment, have to say?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence".
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in Regensburg's Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger, in his opinion, relieves the burden.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the use of violence against prisoners of protection in the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became palpable when a domspatz did not perform a top performance musically.
How do you, as his biographer, rate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is even found in it.
There are only eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-awareness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action.
He can at best be accused of not having experienced it too late or of not taking the first hint seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "resolving", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, present a very excellent testimony, describe him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "comprehensive", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has led to fury.
That he not only banged with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also spread slaps and pulled all too naughty boys on his hair or ears, he admitted himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In order to save his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you still know such punishment methods?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and violence at pre-school, these are, of course, minors.
One wonders whether it is not more about his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell on him.
Many who have never understood him are still working hard at the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a great deal has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Pats.
Will Georg Ratzinger be charged with any involvement or co-consciousness with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Absolutely no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the Master of the Cathedral.
Not even the parents were initiated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one person, representing the others, "I was very embarrassed about everything."
The real problem in elucidating sexual abuse was and still is that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they didn't even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional way.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in relation to abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed put it this way: "As regards sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is ... also really absurd to assume that it is precisely him ... boys have opened up more forcefully or clearly or also rather than towards their parents, boarding school directors, counsellors etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "It could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation that the pupils concerned had entrusted themselves to him in advance and/or their environment".
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be acquitted of any co-consciousness.
In this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to trial.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "excesses of violence" in the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Georg Ratzinger, former master of the cathedral, is accused of looking away in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed up and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses and, let's say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were bullied and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly from it, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
The subject of "pre-school" was taboo, as most witnesses stress.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence".
So the only thing left is the accusation of looking away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods during which it was reported on preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989, he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he pointed out that "pre-school continues to be the subject of beatings".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were already banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to those times.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of assessing past events according to today's moral standards.
The Princess is right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable, and also not to what was committed in preschool in the face of adversities and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was usual at that time.
It's all awful, and I'm glad it's finally being reworked.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping his face and pulling his hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of beating also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, where the cathedral pats played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he led a strict regiment there.
But this too must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world class from the previously more nationally known Regensburg cathedral patzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, one makes unruly boys not great singers and stand before every success, no matter in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-surpassion.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced time and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heart-good people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could even hurt a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
So those who have not forgiven him until today that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral pats today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a lovable respecter, to whom they still look up today and to whom they worship.
And please, once again, quite clearly: all that he is accused of is educational methods that were commonplace at that time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is most unjust to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would command a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merit and without him outside of Bavaria and perhaps still Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, to finally leave in peace.
