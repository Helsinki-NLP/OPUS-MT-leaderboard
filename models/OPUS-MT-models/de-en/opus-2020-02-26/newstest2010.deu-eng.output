Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a cheque of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the Northweg metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The Presidential couple then planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He is the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already indicated that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he took over the prize.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he will take the prize as a President who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, he reinforced the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event program then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, at which, besides Norway's King and Queen, the Prime Minister and a further 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the beginning.
He said, for example, that he felt that he was not entirely earning the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this is "a call for action" for him.
Conservationists are accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the civil association "Nature Conservation Community Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction proceedings last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded from investors money in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokesman, Alena Romova.
The chairperson of the Leitmeritz-Natureschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in custody, and he's facing a prison term of up to three years.
The sorting containers in Brno don't smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find the sorting containers again and again.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage bins.
I do not want to say that the separation of waste in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors are inadequately concerned about this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Jungle League, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics here in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of waste bins for such waste.
Have they tried, for example, to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket at some point in the centre?
This is art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found so far by chance is the Moravian Square across from the hit goose.
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste in other parts is also not a honey slug.
Whole ranks of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
Because it's too far from the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles myself after the party.
But on Konicova Street, I didn't see any tints of paint in sight.
Luckily, I came to the right place when I was driving a tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
That's still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no longer any money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and construction savings.
But also not for the national debt interest rates or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says the finance minister, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or sick leave. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mine laying," says Janota.
The loans pay ever higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, take from where, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party has now given more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
People don't have to be afraid of the pensions or the sickness allowance, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, they get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will rise faster and faster, along with costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then the VAT will no longer be sufficient to increase only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the transfer of funds to some electoral groups, five billion will be missing next year for the development of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections that are won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly reduced.
Mostly get, which is also not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, and the creation of Europe's money is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the drain of money in a salomon way - it attacks the CEZ equity dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe, and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, the budget for CEZ was 18 billion.
Every year, the dividends are used to pay for environmental damage, the pension account is filled up, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the real budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7 per cent GDP, according to EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of upheavals.
Almost three billion fell in the budget for various compensations for victims of Communism and crime or for expenditure on court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
It's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, then we have to pay anyway, Janota makes clear.
The minister must then save the money internally or in the worst case attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the two-billion-dollar project "Staatskasse", which is supposed to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would come in this case, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It's enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware pointed out during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will be in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test sample to the journalist with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualisation and the devices are expected to reach the customer in 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneelose slopes do not only worry the inhabitants of the Krkonoše Mountains.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore you can still get free rooms in Krkonoše Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but by now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, pointed out.
If you want the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, you should not hesitate with the order.
Who prefers saving and where the quality of the stay comes in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mainly only weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think that they will try to sell them for a while, but then they will have to give in, and deal with shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, estimated Jandura.
Free beds on all winter dates are always offered by the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out by now.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, said.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year's Day in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
The first fourteen days in February are also well sold, and the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and a little better than last year, the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We're about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied by 80 percent for New Year's Eve stays at the central car park in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are currently occupied by about 60 percent.
A little weaker now is February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
The Krkonoše hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow sprinkling.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that a warming is to come again, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's almost funny with what student aspiration Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor's strategy on the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off three years ago via the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way forward" without timidity.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea - to send fresh troops to Iraq plagued by the civil war - as an "irresponsible and in its conclusions a karastrophic decision".
The following months showed, however, that the Bush strategy, based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible and to the extent that it was very successful that news about Iraq no longer speaks at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, for objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful starting point than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military once again asked him to increase the contingent of troops, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan's operation General Stanley McCristal, who even criticized the timid White House shooters in spite of their subordination habits.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated on the General Wenists by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has squeezed the pledge for another 5,000, even if he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
His plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months' time and to complete this process within three years is highly problematic in the whole Obama strategy. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fratricidal war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if formally founded correctly, remain only bogus structures behind which patriarchal traditional relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the confusion of the conditions that complicate Pakistan and Iran's influence.
The construction of a "capable state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now on the verge of the explosion.
Believe that the little soldiers who broke out in the war cry about the "early homecoming" create a miracle here, can only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date of withdrawal is purely irresponsibility because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered in the period in which America moves to Obama for the winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, and so there is enough time left for him to move on to another strategy, if this would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonus bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive any bonus bonuses in cash this year.
This is what the company has announced, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers in the event of excessive risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street's bonus bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, said former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs set himself the target of criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters agency, the total amount of premium bonuses in the course of this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars even in spite of the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the beginning of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers' bonuses, which exceed £25,000, once with a 50 percent tax.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Today, five record women from the hands of the King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the specialist categories and literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, Herta Müller, the German writer of Romanian descent, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research in the chromoson field.
The prize for chemistry has been awarded by the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American woman Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes, have won this award for their research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the money prize.
This is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, American President Barak Obama has received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and is also at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday morning, who thinks about his stay in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form approved by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps Janota's stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in his role on Monday.
According to the budget law,which is now being signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion kroons.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left-Party proposals for the transfer of money and increased the money for state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages for farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other hand, have therefore created a sharp internal political dispute, which is why the question mark comes up about the further work of the Fishermen's Cabinet, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed on in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidates the package of austerity measures imposed by the fishermen's government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, should end public debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the state budget law, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have for a long time neglected the "serious problem", which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only be achieved by a strong government that could build on a broader consensus among political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, stated that the budget is horrific and that the government should weigh up its further existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil servant cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
In the editorial office, Premier Fischer described similar words as "strong pronouncements".
CSSD chief Jiri Paroubek responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrific, that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, which exceeded 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world a lot of the country, whose struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela to show him in the Eastwood movie.
Matt Damon takes on another meaningful role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which finally became a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Allmighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became President of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time that is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela combined his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. New President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sport, so he decides to agree the rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
After all, the South African team is rising to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked on it for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other purpose but to play this role in order to bring it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I've noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it's being transmitted, and I felt that I know what you're feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to have become another person.
Matt Damon depicts in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players overwhelmed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise to him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unschlagen" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: The Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed in Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava" which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army is slowly becoming the nightmare of the Russian generality and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site in the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one writes about "bulava" as over a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but glows
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
Technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
Probably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch of the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, the Generality has guarded itself against it, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage were damaged.
Even if no test start was made without errors, the head of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and so it is maintained that the "bulava" will fly once without any problems and will carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defenseman Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself again at the age of 51 in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and is probably already competing against Petersburg in Friday's duel KHL.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defenseman.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some of the remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only concern one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, led fellow player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he becomes the oldest professional ice hockey game in Russia.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe has played a full season for Hartford at fifty-one and has won 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and also triumphed in Canada Cup and in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime is lifted
The management of the Nosovice-Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
On Monday, the union announced its willingness to strike because of overtime hours often ordered.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
But the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December for the reason that two shifts of work would be worked, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees receive this also in hindsight for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek added.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will be paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning issue with regard to the demands and complaints of trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk added.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours almost every day after the eight-hour shift.
Once the agreement is signed, the trade unions will revoke their willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be willing to lift the willingness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management, however, held that the employees had to make the overtime to comply with the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Monday's stand-by announcement that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday would not be sanctioned.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions call for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they are asking for the remuneration of 5000 kroons to be paid this year.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production was started in the company in November last year.
By this September about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with ́stamped ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact predominates against the disadvantage that the compound does not have as much effect on common virus variants as one of the already existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured.
The patient can, however, prolong life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus proliferation also results in the development of resistance viruses, which are no longer effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from VSCHT (Chemical and Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarborans have an effect on the protein that is responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalokarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus increase in a different way than any medicine used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ́improved ́ compounds, which were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The metalokarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus split caused by HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would arise.
When we eliminate HIV protease, we also eliminate the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, explain the scientists in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed further.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of these series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of the metalokarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicines, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants, against which the used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical design, makes the metalocarborans interesting for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight over budget. ODS started on fishermen, he resists
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider their continued existence.
The Prime Minister referred to the ODS as "strong pronouncements".
It's supposed to take time for the analysis.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Civil Service Cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he is going to remain in office with the help of the left-wing Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with Link Party amendments of more than 12 billion kroons.
Parliament increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage with a lag of 163 billion kroons.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has fulfilled the government's wish, because even the modified budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional. Frase not clear
Disappointment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, talked about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with this in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the new service laws.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is up to the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek pointed out in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in a deputy capacity who are committed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to abandon the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is going to be up to date, then I will deal with it, said the Minister of Defence, Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon to attend the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the modified budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister specifically asked the members of the citizens' democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not find ourselves as orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
As soon as I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be primarily about the Bolshevisation of Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railways) fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech Railway will end or limit some less frequented fast and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. base and customer fares will not be changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, and the railway uses Pendolino trains for this line.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be operated on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route are also lifted and some days a week the operation of some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague. Currently, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change trains in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distances to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava, and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run within two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional railway bill: increase of 200 million
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport. In total, the railway will receive four billion kroner for the payment of the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, exactly as this year. Local trains will supply the districts, in total they will pay eight billion kroner for it next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains and express trains, the railway has signed a new ten-year contract, so far the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railways are praising the system, and perhaps that is why they have not taken advantage of the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes only occur with one-day network tickets CD Net and with cheap Internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven rod, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitante arrests more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This is what the Agency AFP said, which initially only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitantes reportedly used the hostages as living shields in flight from the police.
The local negotiators are now seeking the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the weapon faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local famillienclans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre associated with the election to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
Due to suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Filipino province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
But those who resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will come to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of Nelsona Mandela, former President of the Republic of South Africa.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had been allegedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa is culminating in preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media are shaking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination against the inhabitants on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film in his own words.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African advocate of human rights within his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two race groups and for years and days mutually demarcated groups and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the world cup field in his role in the South African National Rugbydress, which was won by South Africa at the time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred plot in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience, thus gaining recognition from the white population.
The Rugby Championship may bring people together to form a single people, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only be demonstrated.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as for example in recent interviews for LN the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
Transformers burn in the Louny area for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem district fire brigade, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the management system according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mantova.
The damage was estimated at several ten million kroner, and the damage will be more accurate only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandova.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened in Cep's society, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the line system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, which transmit the electrical energy to the distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura filed a lawsuit for slander against three heads of CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today filed a lawsuit for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is related to the company's efforts to operate regional rail transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, but we have only made the offer on the scale as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he said that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the criminal complaint to be the continuation of Jancura's medial show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and reputation in my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that on this issue too, it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional insular rail transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kroner in advertising, which will indicate the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and that he wanted to continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railways and did not tender for the order in a high of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we don't give up that we can lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a Member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free of charge and voluntary
Inflation against pneumococcals changes from January onwards.
It should be the first free and voluntary for families.
But even now, voices are calling for mandatory vaccination to be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that must be paid by health insurance companies.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received a dose of the vaccine.
Those who have started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further re-vaccination themselves.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
As a whole, the experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year on vaccination doses.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all area vaccinations of children.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause up to 28 children up to 10 years of age to die every year after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky, head of the Nahlas Association of Citizens, mentioned that the compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has already promoted the pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to do at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, president of the specialist society of practical pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the revaccination rate "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova, however.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcals next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first area vaccination to be paid by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, says Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical paediatricians, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could "execute the money from the health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors themselves will have to buy the vaccines and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son involved in "Museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with a trailer while inviting 90 paintings.
They say Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures like Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press news agency, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings to a camp".
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior denied giving any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure freezes announced in the preliminary report against the criticisms of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had allowed an opportunity "to pass" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury was also under attack for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent capping limit on public wage agreements for 2011.
Social Security Ingredients
Trade unions have protested that low-wage earners will be punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security – to about £3 billion a year – has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PREVENTION-ETAT REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year's decline in the economy by more than expected 4.75 %
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small businesses discarded
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
2.5% increase in public pensions
According to the Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be lower by £90 a year and someone with £40,000 a year will be lower by £190, while a person with £10,000 a year will be richer by £110.
Ministers said their target of deficit halving by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the 5% of top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and expenditure freezes outlined would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big figures. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour party predictions about future economic growth – affecting the size of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction – were challenged after the Chancellor of the Treasury was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75 % this year - much more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the debt would be higher at £3 billion than previously estimated.
Missed opportunity
Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis" said that the planned debt of £789 billion over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how they will pay back and "cynically" press ahead with difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place in June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything of importance about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be saved from future cuts, unlike in the Conservative proposals, which see the deficit shortage faster and more likely to come.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained from the tax increases and expenditure freezes is not used to cover next year's spending to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements - like the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April - the Chancellor of the Treasury would suspend the allegation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra help when people need it most and that the situation is re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come into effect in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Chancellor of the Treasury would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant at Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary budget report. Markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "Crime of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens for suspected extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandshab province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said they're investigating if they're the same men reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of State said they're also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be Pakistani, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges that they are accused of and under what circumstances they are detained," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the authorities were aware of the arrests and were in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We're working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it's actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house owned by one of the students' uncles.
He said that the local police had been interested in the house before and that no charges against the arrested men have been filed.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by your families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuse" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison terms and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then there has been no tolerance for criticism by the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
"They often slapped me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head, threatening me with death, and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty announced.
Beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest following the election and the government's reaction to it, but Amnesty said that the mandates and power of these bodies were unclear and that the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition road.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city shining below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on building minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most declared secular societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argumenting study of a dispute that divided and occupied the country for over a decade and a half, and whose effects can still be perceived today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it, "Islamic space."
He is a good listener, he gives up debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or city hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, to be a good Muslim and, on the other, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen interviewed are mostly divided with their Salafi counterparts – supporters of purist Sunni Islam, which is connected to Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) feel truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "strengthening of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The world's most bleak outlook
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at alarming speed and takes life with it, which cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have recently entered open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also writers in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Immersed in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea, who only fought with the rifle butt of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at one performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the life range of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobile-riding Inuit use powerful assault rifles to hunt down their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
But that is not because of a lack of explanations.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time let us guess the turbulence of the pack ice.
Undersea boats in the Cold War the shifting ridges while sailing down.
A useful addition is satellite surveying and the large-scale application of probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater channel compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... this could be us"
Marine infantry workers were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
The Superior Private De'Angello Robinson travelled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantrymen who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed.
In a few months, from where we're being brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves in the Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this is her way to give back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to helping civilians our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family graveyard.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as their goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held their hands while they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the icy air.
Some read loudly the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white square cards, which had been put in the damp mud for those whose gravestones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son's grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of naval infrastructure sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"When I haven't been here for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the State Department on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the U.S. Interest Group in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5th.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "hazard".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including slight protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy attaches importance to the fact that the United States will make a contribution if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is 15 dollars a month.
The Cuban government has only been allowing ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone this year; they are used primarily for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman for the U.S. interest representation in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - giving free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", an allusion to Raul Castro's appointment as leader of the country, replacing the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and detained within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, especially at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hoped this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque insurgent known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them on the YouTube video page had made positive comments on terrorist attacks.
After arriving in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, home to Al Qaeda and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence department, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to place human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as porters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American would-be recruits are subject to a special review by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to who they allow access to, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded more bold action on climate protection from the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre in the city.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be based on about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered through the city with banners saying "There is no Planet B" in English and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, her mother's country of birth, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the motivation why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be called because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes set fire to several explosive devices near the Copenhagen main canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they began as flares, but then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to have reached the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not even aware of."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent race gap
The testimonies on mathematics performance were last week welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although Washington District is still far behind the country's high-performance schools, the testimonies show that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. has risen from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but only three points from 209 to 212 for their African-American peers.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was captured in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has increased over this period, the difference has hardly decreased with 58 points now.
Some of the district's educational supporters expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already high-performing children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall ranking by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates education equality in Washington D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of test scores is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we don't spend nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of primary and middle school, who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peer classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelike experiences, was brought to Washington under the former school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best efforts available to the students who are below the grade level, said Rhee.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who investigated urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could produce political after-effects that work against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, is, as with other city school inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements of closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to approximately 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year on 185 days a year, which he considered to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The coach reaches the Gettysburg-College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-graders of the group who explore Gettysburg, where teaching costs 38,690 dollars a year, was more of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the Führer announced that they had now entered the Science Building.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the kids went to on their three-day tour, and now they've fully received the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not end high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to get into the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanic Americans completes college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an indwelling drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like her to go to college, especially if these efforts persist over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who investigated Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had financed Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - To power up a gear - and provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only account for two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid was shortlisted.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals surprised analysts at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies give Asian and European the way ahead, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the withdrawal of the US military have probably prevented American oil companies, analysts said, from engaging more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
U.S. companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been involved with technical advice in recent years, have run out of business.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the oil ministry, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its bidders and will fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
Companies pre-selected for bid submission gave bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
An obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is said to have killed a top Al Qaeda deployment planner this week, reports US counter-terrorism officials on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high leader of the terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities, were reportedly killed by a number of missiles that hit their vehicle near Miran Shah city in northern Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official of Pakistani civilian intelligence from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took everything that was left of the "fully destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism campaign gave indeterminate evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy around the world, a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous and pointed to the delicate character of the US air raids on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role as given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and put them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali quickly ascended in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best connections to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this by no means reduces the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN Envoy in Kabul Will Resign
The UN leader in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, ending a stormy term that was clouded by claims of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eid's departure took place when the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal schedule, which is scheduled to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the building of Afghan security forces, sending the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help Afghanistan's political transition.
The military increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign, but only fulfilled an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify UNO
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now forward so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has begun the search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - which was fired - "have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there has already been a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries that donate to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment regulations have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, only one person could be hired.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and downplayed the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good choices, he said in answer to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on my mind is, in the last six years, if we've learned something from Iraq that is unpredictable to the war."
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran must expect "believable" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume talks to limit its nuclear program and would renounce a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided as to whether they should commit to the United States.
Gates said that Iran simply abandoned the international community in relation to some of the proposals they had already agreed to at the beginning of October, frankly bringing the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they never were in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set the 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "suppressive sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's representation at the United Nations condemned what it called "groundless and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities on Thursday, saying that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce US military strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concern about the forthcoming withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course this summer because of the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and final: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There's nothing left for a second child, Wang said, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, spoiled single children, who are affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis in the country is coming up.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of childbearing age need to have babies to "help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and alleviate the labour shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A Gradual Relaxation
Recognized in the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial injunction introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect huge fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their jobs.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples also had sexually selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Peking University Institute of Population Research, said that government officials have recently discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with one partner being an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were almost overnight replaced by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city council has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and put leaflets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that there was an upswing in the requests of couples who wanted a second child after the campaign started, the urban districts did not report any change.
For example, Huinan, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai community Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was also legally permitted.
But, like many Chinese, they only have a minor government health and life insurance policy.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we're being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply a political one.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said that she only wanted a child because she was also an only child. "We were the center of the family and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to do so."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it more bluntly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, which reduces the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents struggling during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on parents' time.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the question of space -- "You have to remodel your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference - which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations - set a focus again on Friday with the publication of a document which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations facing the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, has highlighted both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rise that policy makers would support.
The process is being given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, called "the big picture."
It shows the ground plan for a possible agreement in which the industrialised nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given a boost to Friday's talks by promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
The US Special Representative for Climate Action Todd Stern has rejected formulations that demand binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if not financed by the industrialised nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration was driving a tougher line with China than representatives of the Bush administration less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies getting up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text would not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his statement one hour after the statement of Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, which said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacks "reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.
As the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, break lines have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone more aggressively to hold the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic supremacy will develop, says Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island states "puts political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions had to be resolved before the leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, stepped off their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to cover claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center every day, gitarre-playing activists hold night shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are handed over from hand to hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We're coming to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m. 13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will travel from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network with fast, reliable trains and will connect the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and changing from airplane and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage, could still slow down the British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will hand over the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will give him a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass by urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial with a margin of five metres.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also provide three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railroad insider.
Once completed, travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The drafts would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned in such a way that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be operated on the London-Birmingham line.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal in London would be needed, where 20,000 passengers per hour could be handled.
Given the geographical constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Train experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would mean that travel time between London and Scotland would continue to be over three hours.
This is seen as a crucial crux to ensure a switch from aircraft to rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative's orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative House member, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery that he left to build in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that members of the lower house had to live "on meager rations", has increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak timber timber factory at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer with the additional interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The heads of the House of Commons approved the requests at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditures of the House of Commons members. Last night Duncan said that the requests could not have been "more clean or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control office of the Lower House, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a conservatory called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Committee on Standards and Privileges, during a recent investigation of its previous mortgage contracts, to comment on the increased collection of funds.
The Committee acquitted him of breaking the rules last month following an examination of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, one year before his election as a member of parliament.
This week's published documents show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) of mortgage interest each month by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the entire increase served to finance the borrowing of £75,000 (EUR85,000).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim its right to £1,250 (EUR 1,400) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that parliamentary members would live "on meagre rations."
"In essence, if you work for the state, it means that you have to live by lean rations and how S*****e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I claim a small part of it, as measured by what is proper.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his earlier career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for his expenses for the first time in May when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could "be regarded as an exaggerated demand."
An activist dug a hole in Duncan's lawn in the form of a pound mark as a protest, after it had become known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (EUR 4,500) for three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg to raise the value."
He added: "There is no debate about evasiveness and slanging or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that inspires spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols as a theme for every December day.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional mint pies, pastries filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas carols selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer priest of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize thrilling celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday around the world and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police carried out several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the Climate Change Conference, increasing global climate mobilisation contributes to this, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-ruling police have intervened immediately and without regard.
The police have announced that, according to you, between 600 and 700 people have been arrested in eastern France, in April, mainly members of "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organisers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without distinction", and has stressed that about a hundred of them were "still held in the streets on Saturday night", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and sitting position.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators arrived with buses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with sky-blue raincoats, made a first casserole in the morning in Copenhagen, as you followed the call of the Earth's friends to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological guilt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, filippinist activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organisations.
European MEP José Bové, a figure of critics of globalisation, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable as a result of warming, has given the start to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students who marched in red and hoarded bandanas, where you boasted the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounced that it is a "strike".
On Saturday Abkhazia elected his president, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian area, another Georgian secessionist area recognized by Russia.
The polling stations are closed at 5pm GMT.
The voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the end of the poll, according to the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, said his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia that is illegitimately occupied by Russia.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992 - 1993 conflict, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by means of this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have elected Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote for a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Big signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian president and head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, Beslan Archba, the district chief, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the electoral process.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia in control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the present government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday throughout the world to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at all times ready for action, arrested about 700 people on the brink of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until December 18 receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to smash windows, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-unruly policemen have encircled you immediately and intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Towards evening, during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested, a police officer suffered an injury from a paving stone on his chin. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police were circling in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or with their own vehicle from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say any more: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that are drying up, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental protection organisations.
French MEP José Bové, critic of globalisation, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilised several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who is addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organisers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, have advertised in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organised by the "Network of 350", particularly in Paris, Marseilles in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not compulsory in the terminals (12th school year).
"The Première students (11th school year) now have the same program every four hours a week," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but rather, on the whole, a concentration of "the best student."
"The socio-economic and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. He underlined: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged at the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycea."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) criticized the state's project to remove compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticised this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of Terminal S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a Tuesday protest against the project, which in their opinion is the victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that at the beginning of the year they will undergo a subject-specific aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) and at the end of the year they will have an admission examination, which will examine their teaching skills.
In addition, they carry out internships in the M2 during the year and then teach one year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you will reach even more hours you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally stated that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed once again that he would like to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the operation at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
According to a journalist from the AFP, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and to make them feel like they want to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the margins of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the school's basin.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, even according to their charisma," he specifies.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely in front of about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience might draw from it that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school page from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will then take place every two months.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the prison officials' unions called for a general day of action to ensure that premiums and overtime payments, which were postponed until January for budget reasons, are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Labour Union of Prisoners ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on employees who have no duty to demonstrate and block them in front of the prison on Tuesday morning in order to raise awareness of the "theft of what is due to them".
The Third Union of Prisoners ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night surcharges and the Sunday and holiday surcharges in December will be branded as "harmful and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The head of the prison and the Ministry of Justice declared that overtime in 2009 had risen sharply and not all of them had been provided for in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
In the evening, the Ministry of Justice announced that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the prison officials' unions guaranteeing that payment would be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and modernising," the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have instructed the head of the detention centre to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which was caused by a lack of assessment of overtime, did not repeat itself in the future," Ms Alliot-Marie added.
The December wage is therefore meager, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "household constraints" must hold.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO is outraged in Marseilles and announces that "all meetings and convocations" will boycott up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, when the hours from October are still not paid in December. This also applies to their overtime," threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the resources of the staff is more than inappropriate," says the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he is always distributing Christmas gifts better than he himself is getting.
American President Barack Obama, who is going to spend Christmas with his family at the White House for the first time, told TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he was always giving out better gifts than he was getting himself.
On a special program broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be involved.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you nice gifts last year," she teases the president.
"So please," he swore, mischievously, pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an informal atmosphere with the well-known television presenter who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts that they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten courses and also a basketball, which his father, whom he very rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us once for Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Only much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to order the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll's house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again, RTL confirms that he was transferred to an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated in Los Angeles for serious "damage" after an operation in France. According to the surrounding people, the situation was "under control" although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors noted "damage caused by the operation of a herniated disc" he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damage had required a new operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical report would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, one had a little more certainty about the patient's condition than he opened his eyes, added RTL.
At the request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" that after his first operation in Paris "no drain" was laid.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The surgery, planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt to RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley". He assured, however, that "no need to worry" about making the rock musician, as this was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to sit on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation, that's not working," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacted well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer's health had grown ever more since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general astonishment, it was said that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colon cancer surgery", which resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to disembark a new hospital.
Euro-2009/Short Train: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m layers of men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman asserted himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever bigger things and in this case I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in the same competition for the first time in 1999.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't achieve a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Grave plate estimated at Zola at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman grave plate, which appeared at the French writer Emile Zola of all places, was estimated to be worth $1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the III century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophistic architectural decoration surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for Auction of Roman and Egyptian Antiques at Sotheby's, opposite the AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most of so far," says Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy to AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom at her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching through the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "Erbes von Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as no longer compatible after this conduct by the coup government had rejected it as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authorities, the plane submitted by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelaya, had returned to its point of departure.
The coup government wanted M. Zelaya to "abandon" and asked for political asylum abroad.
The overthrown President refused, however, as he wished to return to Mexico as a welcomed, acting head of state.
The coup regime "suffered a renewed failure by trying to persuade me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has continued in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and gladly for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled two and a half months ago to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa, under attacks of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the Putsch government, told the Honduran Radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he stressed, would only take place as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors about M. Zelaya's departure on Wednesday had mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military had intensified its deployment.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the referendum he organized to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica he had unexpectedly returned on September 21st and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves them, he will be imprisoned for treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argeninia or Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogress had massively voted against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upswing, US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the United States shares and their partners: the Dow Jones increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the close of the stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, again dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "semi-full glasses", so it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the figures of the American trade balance "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October, compared with September.
By contrast, analysts had expected deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the enterprise research economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States increased against all expectations last week and have now reached a level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average for new job seekers has "fallen to the low point of the year" during the last four weeks, stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds for 10 years has risen to 3.482 % compared with 3.432 % from Tuesday evening, and the profitability of bonds for 30 years to 4.492 % compared with 4.408 % from the evening before.
Cuba: Hundreds of guerrillas in power whistling "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban-based guerrillas whipped out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally, which temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "women in Weiss", wives or close political prisoners, were whistled out on the open street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just when they were on foot in the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" the authorized partisans chanted with a raised fist to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Weiss" had taken place the night before in Havana, where there were no casualties or arrests.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also made their way to the demonstration on Thursday in the face of International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, a reporter from the AFP confirmed.
The police, according to this journalist, forced the dissidents of the government's partisans to enter civilian vehicles by force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize, which was awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Women in Weiss" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "Please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list has about 200 persons, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstrations that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionaries."
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of defamation of rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five more people on Friday late afternoon at the main business hours in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first information from the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old with two knives for unexplained causes in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, according to police records, with witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, has succumbed to the consequences of his injuries in the hospital, according to a officer of the police syndicate Alliance.
In or before the same pharmacy, he has taken a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were sent to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, as, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and, according to a police source, she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state".
The armed man, who, according to police, seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, immediately escaped to the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passersby, apparently by chance: a thirty and a forty-year-old, but the latter of them were heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, declared Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried to tame the madman, according to the testimony of the AFP.
I saw a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar reported.
A horde fell on him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with stabbings, according to police records.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by came towards me to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came, injured by cuts.
In the end, state police forces arrested the man who did not carry ID papers.
The Nanterre Procuratorate has commissioned the District Department of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out being sent to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six policemen were forced to tame him at the Clichy Police Commissariat, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the act".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for a reinstatement of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently on trial at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", denounced gross procedural errors in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California.
I'm calling for a fine on the spot, M. Hummel explained before adding that the behaviour of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "leads a cold back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed his verdict with a prosecutor who was said to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which constituted a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and destroyed" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the questionable prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lyed" the authors of the documentary film.
If the Court refuses to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel will require the conduct of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his reasoning.
The indictment, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained at first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the removal of the facts charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled from the USA in 1978, even before the announcement of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then he has not travelled to the USA.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants who are able to escape?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In their opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thereby despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that "there are other escape alternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for an end to the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also once again demanded the lifting of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer be able to be harassed by any revival of the Polansky affair, adding, "No one in this room can say that this process was just.
Thirty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, at the instigation of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and closes without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without any price, in a market torn between better indicators than in the US and an increase in the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has scored 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.16.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is pretty quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrowly limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than envisaged, which "have contributed to improving the market view on the soundness of the recovery of the economy", summarizes analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, which is already two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's Index Preview.
However, the indexes were slowed down by a new rise in the dollar exchange rate, which has reached the highest level against the euro for two months, bringing down the sectors susceptible to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost a little bit of ground.
The bond market has declined.
The 10-year yield on the Treasury bond increased by 3.54% on Wednesday evening compared with 3.482 % and the bond over 30 to 4.497 % compared with 4.492 % on the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month's round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will pass the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch a billion TV viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a veritable swirl of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was simply exceptional.
I've seen a lot of things and had lots of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 5 p.m. to 3 p.m. in Central Europe, from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breath-taking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, and Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and who became both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it's every woman's dream to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defiltrate in traditional costumes and not to forget in a swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to beat, assures Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
As last year, the candidates went on a safari to visit the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not common for a head of state, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I might never be able to get close to.
I'm sure to return to the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive"
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he got off the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 o'clock CET) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fastest" go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after surgery at a herniated disc incident on 26 November.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after intervertebral disc surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last procedure.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event on Friday morning at the French Gymnasium in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer from the AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hôpital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said that they were completely indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
I've heard of a possible trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has travelled to Los Angeles much too quickly and with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke to this doctor personally, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I already had two intervertebral disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced with RTL that the singer apparently would have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant , a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted of tax evasion and fraud several times because of failed operations and not to forget.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Association, described him as "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" responsible to the Board of Appeal and "anything but recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and that the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been running since the last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr Camus.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the party Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted strongly on Friday to a takeover attempt by the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and called upon him, under the threat of a judicial persecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political legacy after giving the left his hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In order to strengthen his efforts, he had received the support of Mr. Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC) who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand because he was the first to apply for the trademark in 2004 at the Institut national de la proprieté industrielle.
However, the office of the UDF party alliance supervised by François Bayrous's friends broke the silence and made it clear that they did not allow themselves to be expropriated and, under the threat of judicial prosecution, set the Minister and the MP a deadline to stop using this seal and transfer the trademark's property rights to it.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF + printed on their political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, declared the UDF's office, and called on the NC party to "explain immediately the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's property rights to its legal beneficiaries".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring a lawsuit against you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978, recalling that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the party "UMP".
According to the undersigned, the Nouveau centre party therefore has no rights to use the Union pour la démocratie française (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 passed the three-year accession to the MoDem party as well as the establishment of a branch to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the trademark, he had been no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
It benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the absence of the deposit of the acronym UDF, in order to accomplish this for itself.
You also point out that this recklessness is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems more dignified to us in politics and in life to make a name for yourself, rather than trying to get out of anonymity by seizing a name in a fraudulent way that has no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier convicted of exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court of Justice decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to catch up with some of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to answer to court on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are scourging and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in their hands.
Similarly, the 15th Trial Chamber ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions submitted during the investigation by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office.
The doctors appointed on Friday are due to present a report before 10 March 2010, in which you clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to go through these tests.
I'll talk to her, said the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As far as Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he is very pleased with the Court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who must be protected, he affirmed.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has launched a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having spent years exploiting her mother's weakness in order to obtain a total of EUR 1 billion in donations in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a big family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer has relied on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she mistrusts the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office is again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to react in this way, in particular because a guardianship judge in the last few days refused to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," said Marie-Christine Daubigny, representative of the prosecutor's office.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of managing large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best as it used to be to impose on consumer products designed by the technicians at the factory.
By placing the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much bigger phenomenon that touches employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&E and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) calls for "a proactive approach and a forward-looking view from all parties involved"; it demands from the employees an effort that is entirely contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would consist of placing employees at the centre of the company's concerns alongside customers on an equal footing.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation after many detours, the whole structure eventually comes to do as a matter of priority what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a much simplified conception of human behavior.
From the large engineering schools their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the American "Neurosciences" and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey by Ipsos published by Le Figaro.fr strengthens the managers in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and measuring the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for the wage earners, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa, which allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings praise to Obama from the right
The American Right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who mocked the award to Obama on 9 October applauded the President's speech this time, following the example of the former Vice Presidential candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the Republican Party's right wing in the US Today newspaper, and added that she herself raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her so-called published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way of explaining his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, argued that the President had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, exulted the former President of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt that this speech was quite historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio program "The Takeaway".
The previous MP, who is considered by some as a potential candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential election nomination, said he was pleased to have seen a "left-wing president" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were "not free and could not give a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "cosmopolite", as "he always does", he "speaks like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble that they did not create themselves and that they do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush era hawk, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, upbeat and inspirationless."
To the President's left, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the armed forces.
If you put the war under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, described the speech itself as a "monumental work" for a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California daily says enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that secures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the imminent heavy supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary in charge of transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators broke up early on Friday morning hoping to sign the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting upset.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was signed only at 18:00.
The conflict "had done a great deal of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transports).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages therefore rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we'll start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some unruly people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement" although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase of 3% in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements to be addressed.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the lowering of taxes on employers in the amount of 100 million euros" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 bill of corrected finances, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to the organisation and then to apply to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
FNTR denounced a "frauding trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to push the goose eaters away on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra laments.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens "to dig a large grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disorders this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the RATP's proposals
The disturbances on the RER A line, France's largest high-speed rail network for the Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between the unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), continues to wait for strikers with their demands for wage increases.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and only one of four trains were ready for use outside the central line.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the passengers to change trains.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the big businesses with traffic technology".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated on schedule at peak hours, and almost none operated during low-traffic periods.
As on Thursday, there was no human strife on the platforms, as the inhabitants of Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would have been up "an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time."
SNCF, which had planned to take care of travellers by staff and officers, pointed out that there had been no shortages at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left via Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strikers' general meetings were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "needy" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER managing director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-due wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its wage supplement proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem, while this was possible with the drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning about 150 drivers visited the office of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership leader who until now rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line following a pre-announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations are demanding a wage supplement of 120 (unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and they are also complaining about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, where millions of travellers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party, a decision immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "party for a democratic society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political process for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the waiver of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders said that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet like non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "consecrations" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries regard as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court is intervening with the government, which is seeking to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to make the support of the PKK by the Kurds dry up and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a re-emergence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in Diyarbakir, a city in the south-east, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The forces of order used tear gas grenades and water cannons when the demonstrators started throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, ed.) issue on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said energy minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of democratic openness promoted by the government," says political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously get caught up in a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
It is so that its employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, this could be the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES follows a precise plan.
As soon as it snows everywhere in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-tracks with large-scale scattering vehicles will be driven off, explains Brauburger.
These include major traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire services, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with wet salt that adheres better.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts."
It'll be difficult if it doesn't snow until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make way for the stray vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, is it the turn of the road to transport and development, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES set off, danger points and transitions are cleared.
In most cases, the FES could not take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4:30, says Brauburger.
Since there is on this fast smoothness, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the spreader is on the move.
If necessary, the police will also call him.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-meter long and 1.50-meter-sized animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, team member Randall Irmis reports from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only single fragments can be found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the lizards split into their three most important lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds known as the "long necks", the four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plant-eating Ornithischia (bird basin dinosaurs), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, such as the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the world, which at that time still formed a single land mass as Supercontinent Pangäa.
This is due to the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The researchers argue that the three cannot descend from a common, immigrated ancestor.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted, because in South America especially many primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Earth's Middle Ages is still puzzling.
During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flight dinosaurs and numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relatives died out at the border from the Triassic to the Jura.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the other reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then a shadow existence lasted: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, and Berkeley, California.
Lecturers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disappoint" the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers during the educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction was an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau had withdrawn itself from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it says.
Protest Legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also solidaritying with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's state youth secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hesse's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of university president and police.
We're grateful to the president of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, says CDU Member of Parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, they had been eliminated.
The Left has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret armament research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt scientific centre Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow's Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, and Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the major companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake block
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
That's right. S21 is much more than the laying down of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg's state capital into hopeless construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then regarded as 19th century traffic-related fossils, which looked like brake blocks of modern rail transport, since it once took an enormous amount of time to change locomotives from the rear to the front.
Drive in, stop for a minute, keep driving - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that's why the main stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which lies about half way of the trans-European rail magic between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian big cities to implement the low ground.
Headway stations, however, no longer have a problem with entry and exit, since modern turnaround trains with train and control cars have existed at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 along with the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being tackled.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway participates, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic of the Taxpayers and not of the state corporation bear.
The project can still be reasonably justified in terms of urban development.
New urban space emerges, which - if one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, to which - typically 80s - huge growth was attributed.
At that time, there was not yet the competition of low-cost aircraft.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros will be spent in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade money will be missing from other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the track has been built in slow motion.
Urgently, it would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine valley route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on airport
The state government left it open in the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian administrative court (VGH) to the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to have the over 400-page VGH ruling reviewed in legal terms, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had provided written reasons for the fact that, in the case of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-establish the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the state government, cannot be reconciled with the legally required protection of the population from nocturnal noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will go against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticised this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered a "worthbreak".
It's damn hard to keep your word, Green boss Tarek Al-Wazir said in allusion to the FDP slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government was trying to come to their night flights with "right-hand-dreaming and trickery".
An exact legal examination needs its time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure resolution, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as it represented the opposition, his group's statements on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden U.S. major banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the bank bailout fund Tarp in a total amount of $45 billion (about €30 billion) in one fell swoop.
According to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC, the Citigroup also plans to reimburse state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised a good $19 billion of fresh money from investors on convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by division sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressed his thanks to the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: the injection of money had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had become the culmination of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to raise money on the capital market for exemption from its liabilities to the State.
On Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, according to CNBC, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman didn't want to comment.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid in June.
Quick choice
Then everything went faster than I thought.
Hardly two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, director of the ZDF Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was the favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage ZDF's director Markus Schachter, should this proposal not get through to the Board of Directors either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schachter had failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted in favour of Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a bitter defeat for the butchers, but one that could be expected.
The majority of the European Union on the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that it would not want to confirm Brender in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had been organized.
With the argument that under Brender the news broadcasts of ZDF had lost ratings, he refused another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sculpted.
In the end, even 35 state-laws had interfered in the debate, which regarded Koch's action as unconstitutional.
It didn't use anything.
The person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance Studies.
He then worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the "today-journal".
Followed by: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morning Magazine"; until 2001 head of ZDF's foreign policy; since then head of ZDF's capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following the election of Brender, who was still elected Journalist of the Year by Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Koch's opposition to the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF state treaty in such a way that the staff proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also excluded an extract of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender's prospective successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move - by criticizing the board strongly for it immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate no-face victims for the post of editor-in-chief, as well as the board of directors, without being suspected of bringing a party-goer into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is attributed to the left-liberals anyway.
Disrupting Study
Partial success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the Minister of Education of the countries finally initiated on Thursday: At a meeting of the Minister of Education and Rectors' Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: In principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and reasonable measure" guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master programmes more flexible.
There should also be no deviating country rules.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Minister of Culture and University Rectors have carried the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations in part: "Each module usually completes with only one examination", says a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of courses of study.
With the "significant reduction of the examination burden", the Accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm stated that a "misdevelopment should be halted, which significantly impeded the studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" will in future be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" if "unnecessary limitations of students in the choice of
In the event of a major accident, the Commission will be able to take the necessary steps to prevent the use of the information in the event of a serious accident.
The students would have "a claim to have room for manoeuvre, to enable and promote initiative of their own".
The rules will apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the review of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this, which are responsible for the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture "emphasised" the countries to influence the agencies in such a way that the quantity of material is not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
In individual Länder, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the Länder ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities are mainly to set up tutoring programmes and strengthen student advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into parliament.
According to this, only one test is to be required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the design of studies more flexible, to ensure the recognition of qualifications at other higher education institutions and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all the country's courses of study will be reviewed for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso-Hochschulgruppen demanded that the design of the education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should now also "co-operate" as affected persons.
The future academics received support from the President of the Higher Education Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said at a meeting on Thursday with the Ministers of Education with whom the HRK discussed a common reform paper.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough in the Bonn decisions as a whole: it demands a legal claim that allows each graduate with a Bachelor's degree to gain access to a further Master's degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that sufficient master's degree places with the best possible study conditions are available tomorrow for today's generation of bachelor's students, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to recruit significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Education did not comment on free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Going into Germany and out is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded several literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he caused a considerable extra-literary stir during a conference in Munich, which focused on "German Literature in Romania in the Mirror and Zerrspiegel of its Securitate Records".
Söllner left a statement in which he admitted his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have begun slowly, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "someone who has not resisted the intimidation attempts of the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary engagement with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of the German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and detestableness of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, as far as we can say according to our knowledge.
In his Securitate file IM Walter had played a role, said after Söllner's confession the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He had "cut him out" in all the difficult points for him at the time, says Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but completely surprising is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate tips, Herta Müller had already written in July after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The affected people, as one can assume, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in the case of the now very process-proof sighting of the Stasi files, the handling of the legacy of Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
Systematic education has been instigated and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the revision of the Securitate Files (CNSAS) was founded in 1999, but the publication of the files has been slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the management of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large was confirmed by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate boss from Temesvar expressed a disparate opinion about the winner.
She had a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself quite openly here in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as is often the case with concealed guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has been harmed? The cautious reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession is hopeful that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire for knowledge rather than guilt and shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just an adret-dressed salesman coming from a very nice Christmas party, on which a sporting goods manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, climbed into a called C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive baldness let himself be chauffeured because of the city he still unknown.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all alcohol was not in play, and drunk with luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work will continue.
Or let's get going.
In the words of the Swiss only three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the descent."
The "more important task" is coming on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the King Class performance in Mainz in the Liga everyday life.
And to stop the again revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The eighth final of the Champions League will be drawn on December 18th in Nyon. The finals of the Champions League will be played at 16./17. + 23./24. February/returns 9./10. + 16./17. March.
So the joy of the brilliant entrance of the Babbel successor remained restrained.
Not only with the supposed healer, who had given the insecure Stuttgart professionals confidence, commitment and joy of playing in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to remember their strengths, and I stopped them to be more courageous, explained shrink Gross the simple-sounding recipe for success, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked a certain amount of magic, Babbel's advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamics, immediately became the best player in the field after weeks of injury, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who penetrates and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel it had obviously been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports executive Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs constancy above all.
Like Gross, players and managers were alsoware of overvaluing the victory against a substituted and completely overtaxed defense against the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening came, Khedira gave consideration.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still in a far distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which relived in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of management of a lack of leadership and had decided to change trainers at the pressure of publishing fans.
Lehmann also considered that his day off had been cancelled after games as a sign of lack of sovereignty and displeasure.
Lehmann's statements were "influenced by pure egoism", Heldt hurried back and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think they're gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work by the replaced coach team the playful and militantly strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Championship Fight in heavyweight
Hitziges Duel in Berne: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard laps the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the association WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the knockout that everyone expected.
Klitschko built up his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give himself due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena, the 2.02 meter-sized Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
However, the 11 centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to get over it.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had caused some whirlwinds before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
When weighing, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of absence, he had defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had to give up without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
I got only one blow in this fight and am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had established a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye after he was able to dethrone Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
His promotion company is now allegedly planning the fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin described Defense Minister Guttenberg as a liar for false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has imputed defense minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to a deliberate deception.
The minister said "knowingly the untruth" about the deadly bombing on two tanker trains in September, Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday on the ARD news show "Tagesschau".
They call it common: he lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted vices, but also about killing two Taliban leaders in a targeted manner.
According to NATO's investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air attack requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, Greens, SPDs and leftists asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's policy on Afghanistan - and whether the chancellor's office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not influence concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there were also doubts about the presentation of the ministry about the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tank loader attack.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and had withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the background of the two top officials, it was reported that they had even referred to several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document of the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter's report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, he says.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in a awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred not only in the case of the mentally ill and in the drug rush.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves uninhibited to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, in the modern Western world, those who experience dreamlike states, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually regarded as crazy or drug addicts, at least as special.
But such images and voices arise not only from the mentally ill or from the drug rush.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion, and reality blur.
Dreamlike altered waking consciousness states can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal messenger substances of the brain - above all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great resemblance of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, delusions of the senses of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, it floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood red, distorted faces, teething.
They hunt him down, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar out of walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, knots them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on a speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The noose is loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson to you, the voices scream in a drum-feeling choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, and he's manic-depressive, he's taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The deceptive images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in life, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can usually no longer distinguish between the inside and the outside world, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, megalomania, relationship or persecution.
Voice listening is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate important things from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis opens the locks to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is in the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, like in a dream, he gets overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Therefore, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible for them, the deceptive images are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
To have experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in the psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place within the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats capriols is still a mystery for researchers.
In every human being, exceptional states can cause him to lose the reference to reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the sole determinants.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in patients.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neural system comes about, which does not manifest itself at all for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the trigger for a psychosis when the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether false images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of position.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations belong to the typical side effects of psychosis, but also to an astonishing number of other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and cranial brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to box, are made up of memory contents that are usually held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritation, stress, heartache or other mental exceptional states.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the Gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and voices.
During the break it may happen that a sloppy boy with long, dark hair will respond to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening
Often the false images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new fellow student, while he explains mathematical equations for all the others, both audible and visible, on the board.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreams, whether the pictures she sees are the frats or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her they think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated from high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she got in touch with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from irritation, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I guess the brain's understaffed, and it's his own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Papa has not been her physical father since she could think.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish between false images and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, where reality takes place.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they seem so real."
Even nightly dream pictures see box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their false images as unreal.
Therefore, caste advises his patients to value the hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too much conscious world, imaginary experience is usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative delusion, which is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of the dreamlike altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even in hindsight.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a human being is threatened with self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete mobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
It's kind of a borderline between dream and hallucination.
Since coping with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intensive form of meaning and meaning in an in itself intolerable situation, which enables us humans to not sink into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body in the intensive care unit is condemned to lack of movement.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visiting strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among noblemen who produce intoxicants from blood.
If a Greek takes a motorcycle to his home country, surf with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meet a Korean mafioso.
He goes on completely in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from every dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast to this, the memories from mental journeys are clear to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced ones.
The intensity of this experience goes beyond the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, Oneiroide, psychosis, hallucinations and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist's box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new editor-in-chief Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company is expected to continue to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have arranged the details of this as a matter of precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
The question of whether they are able to do so, too.
You can't put 7500 employees in front of your children if they're not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company, too.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he would withdraw from the Board of Directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen would be appointed as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
At first, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury division, responsibility for corporate assets was added and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, also for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure of the fall: "This always concerned families who could be infected by a capital addiction, which had been totally speculated and thought that they could thus ascend to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never dreamed of a world power," says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the world league with 'Time' either, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is at your disposal now.
This, at least, is what El Corte Inglés has planned to do, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around personal care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you will find among others prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide depilation with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its teahouse with more than 130 different teas.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while enjoying a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session with entering a personal password on a touchscreen located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if, after you have trained your body, you still want to visit the hairdressing salon, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for regaining the beauty of hair, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open 365 days a year from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the evening.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and so it is a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. You can only advise against that.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE office (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is currently being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise opinions and measures of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates with a view to promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies that the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, is "a horizon of calm".
At the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures that the government launched to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, today we would have a panorama of neglect and the conclusion of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export sector," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided for investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in allusion to Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in the exhaust emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 quadrameters of classic vehicles
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially designed race track in the exterior area of the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental Sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, called i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazda 3 stands out due to its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda with a variety of buttons and switches is in the sensational colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers the appropriate comfort more than ever, so that four adults can travel extremely comfortably by car.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is now only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the gear shift and its low consumption, even though Mazda's diesel models are the best-selling ones.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The main feature of the series equipment is the RVM, which eliminates the blind angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive internal mirrors, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chrome-plated 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements above all the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the Sportive model.
In return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving fun.
A premiere with lots of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red teppich of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, shined more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails, without a possibility to see certain attachments or to surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the road is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the company's success, it has launched two new devices: one intended only for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was introduced yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, but has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to give up all the data in order to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the border of the country or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of flatrate roaming is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside one's own country, one is always afraid to read his emails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it's always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it doesn't have a Wifi/WiFi) can offer these types of tariffs means that telephone providers have to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, namely when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a shopping opportunity with lifelong internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him in his second most important moment in his life, without a doubt: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and she wore something large-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ very much in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a similar model, but gold-coloured.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was plugged up as a hair wreath on this occasion, the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who wish to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fruitability and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not and, if so, what kind of profession they do.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, work only half-days or have no fixed employment contract become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, the women with a permanent job, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a permanent job will only get their first child on average 3.7 years after moving in together, a number which increases to 4.1 years for women with a permanent job, who have taken longer to achieve this and who have moved in and realized the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar of conception," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be noted for women of the same age.
For example, women in the group aged between 35 and 49, depending on whether they only have a secondary education or a higher education, became mothers on average at 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with the main degree already get married before their first permanent job and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly the other way around and first find a permanent job and get married afterwards and then have their first child, notes Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to his envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will become another famous figurehead as before Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (" Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (playmate of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which was chosen as the best model of this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures by Fernando Vicente) to the three x-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-inducing genre (short biography, life and work), but instead seeks an Ähnlichkeit to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither on terror nor enlightenment.
Apart from the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, the morality without guilt and innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of going to heaven in the detour of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 peaks in the world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall, where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny guy.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county, and another time he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane cry that was shouted out from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would echo deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He did this on a journey on which he fled from himself and, with a speech full of violence, begged the worms for posterity.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and slept: my venerable God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I may finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "These verses of Spencer are engraved on his grave: ' the sleep after the effort, / after the thunderstorm of the harbor, / the rest after the war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on them between the Azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, besides destroying the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Fig Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 ran beside her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid that we brought out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they gave him two kicks and hurt him severely.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us where the fun is to be with a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on a leash.
In addition, there is the suffocation that a woman who walked comfortably got when she wanted to reprove these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will perhaps do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police department, but we have serious doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what has happened has caused us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies have announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of her commitment to road safety, which "includes far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming safer and safer every day", and further confirmed that, with other actions, it also contributes to bringing this goal one step closer every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to the development of increasingly safer products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008 and, more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac association of manufacturers and the Gandam association of car dealers.
However, these good figures are at present only with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison are November 2008 which was a particularly poor year of caucity with a decrease of 60% over the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in last month, the total registrations for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all the vehicles that make up the small van market: descenders of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans/cargos.
Furthermore, there are still the same thunderstorm clouds in the sky, which most affect demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, most of the sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
In addition to these restrictions, which are the result of the bank's faucet, other factors must be included, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, the financial support has helped little in the purchase of a vehicle under the 2000E plan.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small businesses who want to buy a small van of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to also pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The car dealer's association predicts for 2010 a year similar to the one just before, for which it expects a sales loss (in passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock braking system at that time, and as is currently happening with the ESP stability control system, emergency braking systems must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, and for the remaining vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but due to its operation these braking systems can also help to prevent many collisions.
The task of the emergency braking assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal, based on the braking strength specified by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even get to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, every year up to 1,100 fatal accidents causing damage to pedestrians could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is expected that one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the employees of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europa, wants the affected party to give its approval to each and every point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
In contrast, GM is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
In the absence of an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, with which it now weighs only 1,275 kilos.
In order to achieve this, they were the first to dispense with the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent roof with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning system again 13; moreover, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 liters, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch rims again five.
Then one had achieved another six kilos less by not using the CDR-30 audio system and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the PDK double clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed hand-held vehicle, mainly on the smaller land roads of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curvy.
With his driving behaviour, he can only be given the mark perfectly.
However, the reduction of its weight has by no means led to the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model, which at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a little athlete, able to warm his muscles in a low gear in the necessary time until we give him the orders to race, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he's told. The car does everything we can to show him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all flavors
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used in the Panamera for the first time.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing out or from re-acceleration.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads, on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route, even though we found ice at dawn and roll split in the morning at some of these curves.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving experience, as it is usually rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stiff neck as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many unusual players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the ranking).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mikov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blue Reds, who sat at the top of the scoreboard from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the Vitoria team already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the playing field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava decided to play inside Barac and the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already hinted that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was still far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with confidence to get air again and one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the ad board again calming distance of (54-67) that the host could beautify at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alawesen were placed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson did not resign the best of their team and tried to give their team power again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was put out of place because of fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended themselves well and although the Israelis caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from browning
Unicaja lost vocally in Greece against Olympiacos and had to give the lead in group B of the Euroliga to him, in a game characterized by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inner game, which facilitated the victory for the Greeks.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their presented game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggresive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of being a Unicaja, even though the local team with an inner game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the scoreboard in their favor in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute when, due to an action, the two Americans Beverley and Williams almost got into a fight and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces in the Unicaja.
Among her players in the inner field and the Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with his triples, she increased her advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, was superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn made the group's lead fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to ignore the many failures and the departure of Robert Archibald, a Scotsman injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, a little hope for 66-57 came back in the 31st minute thanks to Cook's lead and triples and Lewis's use.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be braked.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to let the basket difference rise to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give himself beaten and had to resign the leadership toOlympiacos.
How much should you earn due to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now experience their salary due to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates users' salaries on the basis of more than 140,000 job vacancies available at Trovit in Spain. Users can use a Facebook form to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker "feeled badly paid on average," explains Albert Ribera, who is responsible for the Trovit product, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual net of 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most wanted places on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The president removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010 when his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy where he had found asylum since September 21st.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, as his mandate expires on that day and he must seek new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (where Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, due to Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum seeker who the "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and, indirectly, to allow the liquidity to be free at interest rates that move around zero to enable banks to purchase assets for settlement.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox policy of liquidity, begin to spread some sand into the gear, as the BCE näc has already done with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonds are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalize private risks and public debt is rising again.
Quality is now being restored and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability until now, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision regarding Spain's valuation.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had once again tried to create awareness among the leaders of world economic policy for what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects that the limitation of loans led to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to have passed a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals public debt, elections and a new government that pulls along the same lines.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account in the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some debauchery at too high amounts, that would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt are increasing at the same rate as the European corporate bonds.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish were to increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the early indicators here force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to adjust their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long life span despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, even though it is called "cautious driving" at the moment.
Linked branches
Iberdrola's chairman, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply will be debated in these days over the next two decades.
After his performance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some touchpoints on what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and a further EUR 60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international networks.
From 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18.000 MW more will be needed, under the condition of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft constitution for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly taken, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investment, even if they are long-term, should already be taken, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Swissport in Switzerland, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for baggage services at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, on which figures have not yet been published, is for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation yesterday to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be the study of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city council wants the construction to be completed at the end of 2014.
After the administration decided on public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) in order to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and toll station administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly composed of European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues subgroup, will compete against the team of Acciona.
The third and last consortium is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction works and privatisations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as it is only through the purchase of a local construction company that one gets access.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, owner of the Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the industry, in which it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll line, which is supported by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and is called Northern Link (North Shuttle), has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass road (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, which is the largest measure of congestion reduction on the Brisbane road.
The timetable issued by the city council foresees the award of the contract for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is already to open for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction works will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
For Hochtief Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia continues to award substantial contracts to Hochtief, which signed a contract with the government yesterday, amounting to 154 million.
The subsidiary ACS will use its local subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This improvement will provide fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
Initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has acquired the sum of 64.5 million euros for the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company received this contract only a few days after it was awarded the contract for construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnelling.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its execution will take more than 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has attributed advertising and marketing services to the agency Sra. Rushmore for the next two years over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, which presented sch to this competition advertised by Renfe, of which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and manufacturing the campaigns.
Punishment of 63 million for France Télécom because of the deceleration of the competition.
France Télécom has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France's competition regulator for anti-competitive behaviour in its Caribbean regions.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 for impeding its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that monitors competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore become relapsed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trade site on the Internet in order to increase revenue from transactions that do not arise from the telephone connection.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 for this test to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The match at the Champions League has earned 476,4 million from Madrid and Barça since the beginning.
The Champions League has become a source of income for football clubs since its creation in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have won 476.4 million since then, giving them third and fifth place in the football clubs that made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the Champions League of UEFA not only brings fame with it. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has allocated up to EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) that have been participating in this event since its foundation in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and which, besides the AC Milan, is the only one who has won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup 1992 finished fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
And even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that could receive money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, in contrast to four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction can be explained by the complicated allocation procedure that UEFA is applying.
In this financial year, the organization, whose chairman is Michel Platini, anticipates revenue of 1,090 million by the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying preliminary round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won to participate got 3.8 million through their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they played.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team).The clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter final, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club gets at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million fixed revenues.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is awarded in proportion to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9 % interest in Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details of the purchase offer of shares with which it intends to acquire a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this postponement.
Yesterday the Sos shares closed with 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa assesses the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is connected with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group shall give shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
On completion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In the attempt to stay on the brink of possible offers of purchase and the court disputes of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision by which she becomes the first woman to hold a high position at the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the group's chairmanship.
This is anything but polemic-free because the company is involved in a court battle because of the suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the loan of Salazar, ex-advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves Paternina's public exclusion notice submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion notice submitted by the investment company Mer for Federico Paternina last 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it would approve this invitation to tender after it had been shown that the conditions were in compliance with the final laws and that the content of the explanatory supplement submitted, following the amendments made on 2 December, could therefore be considered as "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn is 8.95 % of the share capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
Furthermore, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legally binding laws.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only car repairers earn
Every day thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest informatics tools, it is a matter of minutes
This is why almost 100% of the evaluators use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs shall collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process it afterwards and to offer it to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader; 80% of all reports are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, up to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been introduced in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car enters the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, an "intelligent" graphic image is created by each model, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the process is progressing rapidly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has full information for 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the roads, it is more than 99%.
In order to carry out documentation work and to produce databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specialises in specific brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the value of a car.
The only company that informs about a leader about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products being a standard solution for assessing accidents for the evaluators.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid according to the intended use, i.e. for each report.
Most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it up to ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, each insurance company that makes thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, one can completely identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line, solely on the basis of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an open service for the specialist market on the Internet, which can be offered for vehicles that have been declared to be total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or in order to obtain information on the deviations by brand and model.
For example, one can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for evaluators and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT expert guide is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased at 20% per year over the last three years and sales in 2008 amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounted to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been part of the Standard & Poor's reference index on the New York Stock Exchange.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a flat foot on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant paying EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and added value, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is addressed exclusively to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, evaluators, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the site has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 evaluators.
3,000 ads are managed every day and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered is no longer allowed to travel on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be re-registered even if they have been deregistered after difficult administrative procedures.
Estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the tool Auda-Taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of working hours, extra charges or discounts, and after that he can have the estimate printed out and passed on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the working hours targeted at the workshop do not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
At the moment, the company Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, as you can, for example, choose a door with it and then turn the picture completely around to look at the inside.
