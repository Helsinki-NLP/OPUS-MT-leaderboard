The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into the negative against closing of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed the collapse of Monday at the beginning of Tuesday's business, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time there was the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market's response to the outcome of the US House of Representatives vote, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday with shares on the Asian stock exchanges, although the indices were able to compensate for some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index lost nearly four percentage points during the business day, but later managed to offset some of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, decreased by 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange declined by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing of the bailout in the US is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its own monetary policy, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial support scheme.
Otherwise, it would threaten that other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the basic causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
The American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest decline in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by almost seven percent, and had recently recorded a similar decline in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any indication that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress concedes: US government allows 700 billion dollars to be pumped into banks
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
This is to be voted on at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators achieved a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system to a size of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told the Reuters agency.
In the Senate, different figures suggest that the plan could probably be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there was a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could help markets in practice.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilise the market should look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
You said there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the American finance minister Henry Paulson the night of Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which plunge financial firms into serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
You have to continue the health plan even further, but I think we are at the target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asia's business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
The aim is to reassure investors against the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision of the Congress could influence the business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is there any doubt as to whether negotiations at the last minute could still fail due to a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will still undergo some changes.
The total amount of aid for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
Congress, however, can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with a further $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush evaluates progress in negotiations positively
The President has a right of veto in this decision, but Congress can overrule his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress made.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "estimated the two-way effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the banking committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
He's to be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also anticipates help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to the main economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that is because one does not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses among themselves," said Marek this week to the iHNed.cz server.
According to Marek, whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive.
"It is much more important for Congressmen to agree to support the plan and to say goodbye as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the adoption is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on Messer's cutting edge: MP3 player against cell phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still make calls.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy one phone.
Despite that, there are plenty of reasons why you should get a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
I'm sure it's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you'll probably dream of one at least.
So this is also with music traveling, i.e. with compressed music, expressed in simplified terms - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but also a pink floyd fan will hardly be able to handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is broad.
The lifespan of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what cell phones can do doesn't even make sense.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and videos, record both, it sometimes has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures.
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are much more powerful.
That's why you should expect the cheap phones to not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you then make calls from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you won't have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one time charging off.
There is another problem if you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, moreover, not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones without any reduction.
For players, except for exceptions (iPod), you do not need any special software.
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves create a music library, arranged by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the lifespan of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and of course also the ease of use.
If for you music is especially a backdrop and you listen to it every day only briefly, for example, in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which almost any cell phone can do.
You also don't have to control which music formats a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 create everyone, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in itself as to why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can rely on the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the few MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you'll get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players lies in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really be used by anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous invoice for data transmissions.
Which device should you grab now?
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g.Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
Yes, you are.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use is thus approached by a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players, is the most farthest.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) will afford you MP3 players of the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer practically all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÚ Telecommunications Authority, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the recent steps taken by the European Commission in regulating roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How come prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to scold that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák often agrees with this, who in the past had often said that there was no place for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of chances (by the way he would probably find hardly any frequencies).
But there is one more option - a virtual provider.
The entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which the traditional mobile phone providers had to react.
Before such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the country's five largest provider.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually make themselves known as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, in the UK, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half of the cost compared to its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good move to rely on a non-cliche target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could take root in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav Čepický's press spokesman also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of service provision."
In the Czech Republic there are no chances, the mobile telephone operators say
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," says Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor emerges.
Their interest in starting a virtual mobile phone provider has been demonstrated for a long time by the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate customers sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in negotiations," said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specifics compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršeň of Telefónica O2 in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile's spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in a rare way in line with the O2 statement: "So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to continue to build."
And she adds: "There will hardly be a virtual provider on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this moment, we would have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
We regard this as the best from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, and another would mean more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something is also evidenced by the long back and forth around the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of ČTÚ was at the time when U:fon came into the market from the company T-Mobile.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competition environment of the mobile phone market was also recently strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
However, given this approach of mobile operators, the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately - unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, had a very typical attitude to this whole problem.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile phone provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider about renting the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional providers," said Kristián Chalupa from the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS in his reply to our request.
Such a formulation would not be surprising by representatives of suppliers.
This is more than questionable by an authority representing consumers' interests and, among other things, ensuring that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
But probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the three mobile telephone operators are in almost touch with each other, as a result of their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the petrol stations is certainly just chance and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has found no signs of anti-competitive action in this matter, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing from the telecoms regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile operators will have a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the entry into the market of a virtual provider.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has a monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if this argument is not taken along, it should at least be a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are remarkably similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a quite common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, it has failed to enforce the extension of ČTÚ's competences to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one looks
First of all, the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partly public.
Normally, they are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile telephone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar kind of resale.
"If there are cases that describe you, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will deal with, which may lead to the termination of the cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not get around with those responsible for mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, they may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
In fact, profits from the activities of these companies are not negligible to them, and at the same time, unlike actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law allows for such types of speculation, despite which the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot have it fully as the normal customers of mobile operators."
That alone, however, would have to seem strange to ČTÚ at least.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
Do mobile operators close their eyes to such action, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the provider's statement that they know nothing about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been pointed out several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers resulted in a significant fall in the price of the various services.
Virtually in all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies intervened precisely at these moments, which by no means sought to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators throw themselves at the whole case like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertainty in skills in these cases is more than favourable.
But let's not throw the shotgun into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile market may soon be back in motion.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will at last not be making more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Wo is my home country on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood in a ceremony.
The anthem was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The song was written by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices that are striking and popular for the solo versions.
"From the very beginning, I tried to maintain a clear diction with both of them, and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that a harmony can be created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was performed for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stand Theatre in the originally Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
On Wednesday, Prague transport companies will also be carrying on a chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1st, 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport companies as a date when the first passengers will enter a subway, tram or bus, carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
This can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it displayed on their smart card at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Since yesterday the coupons are also available on the Internet on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
They buy the coupon via the Internet, which is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, there is also a desk with trained staff at the disposal of travellers, who advises interested parties when buying the Internet and also places the coupon on the map," says the spokesman for the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons at self-service machines on the Opencard, which are installed in some subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, remind of ticket devaluers, the passengers have perhaps already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls a machine instead of the driver
Operation of the vending machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
All you have to do is introduce the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the Mittelböhmen region enter the capital.
"In trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport, train attendants have reading equipment that allows them to check the validity of coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation. This organisation compiles timetables for Prague transport operators.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's desk.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed in a marked place on the side of the cash register.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the featured coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal says.
A passenger who does not travel with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can again go to the self-service vending machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the US
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish some groups of Sudeten Germans came to the US president in 1945.
This can be seen, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American President not to allow the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "People who have the fate of the Sudeten at heart".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - aware of the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are acknowledging a foreign state for us, which is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has not contributed anything at all to the victory of the Allies," says the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President doubted the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the U.S. or live under the protective rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, it does, however, draw a good picture in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had at least had to suspect that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was employed as a Budweiser German in the Baltic Sea Navy during the war.
When he was captured in British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would pass them," said Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected that they would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign aimed at drivers
Most expensive action for safety on the streets in Czech history.
This is also how the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could be characterised.
Minister Aleš Żebíček's authority promises to disengage drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million kroner will be on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
She's supposed to get the drivers to drive too fast and drink at the wheel.
And they also remember to strap up before the start of the ride.
The campaign wants to bring young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers into the conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also bears witness to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood, the word "pay" is written.
This means that one can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see images with drastic shots of victims of accidents.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of fatalities on Czech roads will fall.
The spots have been compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and whip for drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is carrot and whip.
Carrot bread means that when driving for example with red, it saves time.
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
That is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, even less effective are panels that draw the attention of drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static panel that warns of danger, it will probably soon spill away with the surrounding area, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke out in favour of the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace could be concluded with Palestine and Syria in exchange.
He emphasized this in an interview, which was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to assign a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, doesn't want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, killing several people and hurt dozens of people.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templar and holy and historical places" located in the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert argued for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," said Olmert.
"The Syrians know all too well what they need to do without to get the Golan heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (jiatian) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (jiatian) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law does not know her, in a long-distance bus it is not permitted to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus operated by the Student Agency near Padua in Italy, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth in the bus while travelling.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess was killed last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the way of the bus.
At this moment, the young woman was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, even though she had two more seats at her disposal.
However, a bus can also have an accident or sharply slow down at the moment when the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing places after the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided for in the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance coaches have no standing space, as confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jančura, opposite Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not agree to the movement of travellers at first.
Later this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
The law doesn't know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the concept of vehicle attendants, but its rights and obligations do not define them," adds the spokesman of the Hanzelka Ministry.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem retrospectively.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product registration also has standing places.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing spaces and the maximum speed is limited, buses with standing spaces and a higher permitted speed, and coaches with no standing spaces with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP specialist in road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"There are not many risks associated with a liquid way of driving, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it is not certain when turbulence is coming, and the stewardess can bump his head."
"However, if a bus is sharp, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this problem will not be fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider her profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to travellers when boarding.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, we'll fight them right from the start.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had said for Týden.cz not quite a year ago.
That was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off without blinking from the stand strip and had blocked the bus's journey.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but colliding with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two places for the stewards were sold.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A change of laws?
Not in sight
A more detailed regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-strong team of experts at the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the top speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the stewards' activities to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses being the competence of the police and the health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
Big words are not lacking in the letter from the WestLB board to the staff of the House.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, according to the letter that became known on Monday.
WestLB would introduce a "block of expertise" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
In any case, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbanks sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the battered WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has only recently made clear, the time has come to find a solution to the future.
However, we have been talking about a connection between the Deka bank, which savings bank customers know because of its investment funds, and WestLB has been talking about for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka Bank's head Franz Waas informed us at the end of August when presenting the half-year figures, he sees no sense in a merger of the company on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is supported half by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbanden each, commissioned the Board of Directors to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, just begun, it is said in the financial centre.
The Deka bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first time in terms of consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it looked for a moment as if the Deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing became of this threefold covenant.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba's involvement in them.
The other two houses did not find each other either.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection between the Deka bank and Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against planning games about going together with his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems that the recognition that the various houses in the public service sector are coming together is a matter of urgency.
After the federal election in Bavaria is over, a connection of BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to move closer.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure increases to further mergers, the partners gradually go out for it.
In the south, she would only be junior partners, although she has endured the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thuringia, which holds 85 percent of the Helaba stake, put a stop to a meeting with West LB.
At best, the North LB remained.
Such geostrategic considerations are only the one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit each other.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model should ensure the sustainability of the Landesbanks had not been answered by the Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a disassembly of the West LB, which, of course, is not wanted there.
Thus, the letter from the local board of directors speaks of the fact that a "total solution" for the house is in any case sought.
How this can be reconciled with the merging of individual units with the Deka bank will still be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built beard tiger and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest-traveller what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap first, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the train station Puorta Nuova, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", will start this evening at 11:45 pm.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, with only Brazilians travelling in one bus.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing beside their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur imitation lining and glasses with wide silver irons, includes the buses.
They have been going to the Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the meadow, back at 10.30 p.m.
Spending the night would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity regulations, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet on the bus, the travellers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
In Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where also several other buses with Italian license plates on the highway 8 take a break just before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese on schedule at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put the yellow cap on.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, next to it is the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors open to the beer tent, it's called running!" Marco calls into the morning.
"Running!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, Marco roars, costs 8,25 euros.
And don't forget tipping.
"The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they'll be gone!"
Third, "Think of it again tonight at half past eleven!"
And we're going to the Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second Wiesnwochenend, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There is no exact figures; we are talking about 50 000 people on their way across the Alps and entering the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors are said to have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries a national statistics, in which the Italians place first in front of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical care.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also intertwined that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis-like developments.
Because that has now occurred on the weekend.
The Munich-based real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only had to pay interest on the part it also claimed.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses in the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financier had financed himself extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of the mistrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, income from attributions to receivables and certain securities and from the dissolution of provisions in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from refunds of downstream clearing costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the tax rules and from the business management for Group companies, had the profit reduction still moderated at around 16 percent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former public financer had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been dissociated from Aareal Bank.
Because traditional state funding was not enough, the Depfa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "essential material effect" on the Group's profit and loss account, hotly it is quite indefinite.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been cut by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financer since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market, since it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has largely dried up again, as the banks hoard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing each year for a part - about 50 billion euros - of the loan portfolio of the Depfa.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs will be covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company will be shielded "from the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international money markets".
It can be heard from other sources that, thanks to the funds, refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This represents hope for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it is not unthinkable that funding does not have to be used to the full.
But the opposite is not to be worn out either.
After the bank was still insolvent on late Sunday evening, even the at least provisional rescue cannot calm the moods.
The share price drops by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, bond prices are quite good.
If the priority debt is barely moving, the prices of the subordinated bonds will decline more clearly.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are particularly concerned and understandably the maturity beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds previously appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their worth must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the marked tightening of the banking crisis and of the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into its home with the takeover of the Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable commercial banks are still prepared to support the system, retirement pensions can be expected to be repaid in due time.
Or what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment is that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports that are overturned by the partial nationalization, the probability of security at present has only become a legitimate hope.
This is likely to lead to some sleepless nights for long-term believers in particular with the decision whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
Short-term investors can, after all, use a term to form a loss carry forward for future settlement tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start giggling: The Germans are totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before school, I had bammel.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the class at Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as it is at home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from eight o'clock until at twenty to nine a short round of meetings with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
But I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, plus blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very glad that I had already started to learn the language a good two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all chuckled, giggled and waved and I have heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival-important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl next to me grinned pretty much, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really overwhelmed.
Everyone talked and giggled and asked me holes in my stomach - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunch box - that is something different from the boring German breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in my tofu coat.
I usually don't know what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made Bento, which she then creates especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during a snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious to see if I can watch this.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I used to say,
"Because I'm fascinated."
After all, I've been reading mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in it, I started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a soft spot for tradition, customs and customs.
And you put great value on them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in danger, does that mean that she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how could you verify that they feel the same if they behave in a similar way to us?
For several years, the Internet magazine Edge has published contributions from famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far, where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of feeling or, more generally, of consciousness, we enter impervious terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in the short-term memory and the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be, is likely to differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, his research poses us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that may be more accessible scientifically.
One could examine the processes of consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick pursued, one is more likely to refer to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What results for the sensations?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activities.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain-located defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish primates and, in particular, humans.
Linked to the linguistic nature, subtle gradations of feeling arise, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to others as well as to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations emerge from more primitive activities in the body regions of the cortex and brain stem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-genusal sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict this, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fearful in rats and humans is probably the same in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same if they behave similarly?
A cockroach escapes in danger of fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral likeness cannot yet prove an equal experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove that for humans, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is waved here, if one measures the same in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You might think it's shortsighted, but I'd rather go ahead than walk against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
The number of EM stadiums may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Several first team members had been sentenced to forced retirement in the last season alone for manipulation, after all even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her former Dennis Quaid as adulterer.
He foams - and strikes back.
Late Rose War with ex-marriage Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now waging an unsightly argument with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She had learned the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The reason for the soul triptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's outrageous," said the 54-year-old of "New York Daily News" that "Meg repeatedly chews and reseals the history of our relationship."
It is also "unfortunate" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so his admissions close with the side blow: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Prices for air tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany were up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant decline in the second quarter following a rise in prices in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays in many places have already been discounted.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities examined rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most marked in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a reason, American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate, which has led to a "decreasing desire for travel of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices, with an increase of 26.3 percent, even hold the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter was also upwards in the case of air fares:
Due to the kerosene increase, economy-class travelers had to pay an average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for Economy Class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First Class prices were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, prices on German domestic flights have even halved.
The reason for the fall in prices is on the one hand the slowdown in economic growth, explains the company.
Demand is crumbling in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, has increased competitive pressure.
The tense situation was characterised by the cancellation of unprofitable routes for airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had declared bankrupt in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, these were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV will become the leader in the table.
In the Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning Elf.
By Kristoffer Klein increase break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, and it was convincing to him.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin gang of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the actors.
And so his request was also heard in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have sounded similar: Give me gate two!
The implementation did not take place.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it "relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0) is due to the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class primate.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular certificate stands for the unpredictability of the league rather than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late entries - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric as well as the Jansen recruited by FC Bayern - can be found slowly, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the defeat of the vote
On Wall Street, fear is all about.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to break in by 700 points at times.
That was the biggest loss of points within one day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer recorded a good five percent in the minus at 10,579 meters.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was 1548 points in the minus with more than seven percent.
The largest loser at this time was the Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs declined by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the company.
The rescue plan is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid at one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option certificates from financial companies that could be redeemed if the price changes were to be made in order to reduce the burden on the State Treasury.
Share prices down in Europe and USA
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not address investors' doubts.
The share price of the German large bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and pulls the Dax down.
The US index Dow Jones loses despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have deeply reduced the German stock index (Dax).
Despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, the share of Munich's real estate financier lost three quarters of its value at times, while Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Globally, the stock markets fell to their knees.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout might not be enough to get the financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 meters after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 meters.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor declined after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences flight from space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused perplexity in research: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Because of soon frozen fuel lines you are now threatened with cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion for years - swing-by-anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes, in which they get additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprised about for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable gravitational law.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain swing-by-anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The anomaly could be responsible for dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not transmit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter is at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the tourists abducted in Egypt are said to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
Six hostage-takers were killed in a shooting before the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
I want ransom negotiations already underway.
Again and again Germans get into the sights of kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who have been deported to the Sahara appear to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV station Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're just checking her health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are safe and sound, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "just about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather caused a woman to kill herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a prison sentence of six years after he had confessed eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time as a volunteer, was being persecuted by the abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "saved her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead at her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended up like this: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I didn't force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added, "I take note of the impact, according to Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data shall be charged with:
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded to the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest indictment within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Procuratorate recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police with the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he transferred contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies consider B&B costs
British housing companies could cost more than £80 million after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million deposits.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans have been repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to cover some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay together about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to raise 81 million pounds for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Societies, informed the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate upswing are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest is due for a full year, and that could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are both-sided organisations without partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre on Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm have been carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Prior to the February price increase, Jersey Milch's wholesale price changed most recently in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused bail on charges of extorting 50 million Taka ($729.700) from a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the transitional military-assisted government should first grant her unrestricted freedom.
The correspondents say that, although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear, as part of her release, whether she will be able to stay at liberty when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not have to be bailed because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file an appeal against the upper court."
Your lawyers object that they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheik Hasina was expected to return home after October 17th, said an Awami Alliance party leader on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-assisted transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears about the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations said.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of staff carrying out vaccinations.
BskyB loses suit in case ITV
BskyB has lost its claim against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing channel ITV.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share distorts competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL from buying ITV, now renamed Virgin Media.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's purchase of ITV's stake in ITV would raise doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office of Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. U.S. prosecutor's affair
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised the White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been deposed for political reasons.
The special investigator Nora Dannehy is now supposed to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal actions, have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from office in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to regard the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial prosecution of high-ranking Republican Congress members, while others had refused to investigate the accusations of election fraud by the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are charged with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be withdrawn for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been attacked for the dismissals and has ultimately resigned from office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General has raised the role of Gonzales critically by bearing the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, by giving up his leadership role and by showing himself to be "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including President Bush Karl Rove's former chief advisor, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honoured for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music award ceremony "Q Award".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize in London next week during the award ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's award after being shortlisted in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there are some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute larynx infection.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of major roads, avenues, side streets and other bypasses, some of which are famous and others are just convenient.
Nevertheless, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals to tell where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are also no road signs.
It's practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to pave Extra Place anew to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block of houses.
However, the municipal administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district administrator in the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street will be paved and seats will be set up, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent out space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road but did not want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said that it was indeed the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802 when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly the most famous backdrop for the photo on Ramones' album's cover of "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Extinction of the City"), has published part of the talk of the city's history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusty metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and week-old newspapers flying past rain channels".
With a few exceptions, the street looked just as recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said that they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be slightly polished.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in English-speaking surroundings
In this issue of "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Fellow in Kalifonian Studies and Senior Director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Selection".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of successful completion of school for African-American and Hispanic students is lower than for white students" - which is true.
In order to close this gap, Obama's educational plan recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in training for those who learn English first.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of pupils are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 an amazing 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprising were 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year in the English exam rated as good.
This amazing success was achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach of training in an English-speaking environment. That's exactly the point Obama is supposed to pay attention to, according to headmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches great importance to the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialized teaching.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had only come from Mexico shortly before. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and not recognize him.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The achievements of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national image associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the "English only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the power gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work instead of despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even the American bailout for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The crude oil futures on the New York Trading Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken both by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and by strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, and then to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were worried again, even though Congressional representatives had announced that they had agreed on a bailout plan on the weekend that would be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from complete.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis for now, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place at the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have adjusted their expectations for oil consumption downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and their projections for oil and gas prices for 2009 have been reduced by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after spending the last eight and a half years more than anyone else in the Jets jersey.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a resultless game into a triumphal procession.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which was in line with the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration took a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, one slipping out as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't make much effort," Coles says about the passports that went to Cole's.
"He's a super player.
Our vote voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
External defender Darrelle Revis caught an accident and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had won the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets reconquered the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot into a 34-to-0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without achieving a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2 km distance in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, for fear, which was perhaps exaggerated in hindsight, that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long-distance racing, the record time for marathons in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Apparently, after a break he came back refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for over orchestrating his races, avoiding many world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had slowed down.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last start to break up with Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now from Germans, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result ever at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She skilfully planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan women runners pulled out first, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the exuberances of the theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, there is a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet places, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city she describes – and which made her a tourist destination by taking her to the Florida travel guide produced by the federal writer's project during the Depression – is in many ways a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what's missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the city and a community member of the city's oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a stronghold of literature and on the other, an example of the black culture - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Beyond the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown and white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always takes care of, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and what-ever-fits with hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville to self - government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty, full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
It is still remembered here that Hurtson was a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to town, she usually did this without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed with pants, in a city that even today is imagining something of her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he was rocking in his chair, on a back-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there was no major memorial, no large-scale public readings.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turnaround came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to set up a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the community.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"During this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration by calling its decision against the school council "offending rather than respecting my race."
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was in some ways positive, it weakened the group's cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged their teacher in the morning and hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped to create room for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who have ignored prejudices, as they have done, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set off for Hurston's nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelves, and made it once again part of the American literature canon.
The road project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as their savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated it at top speed, aroused real citizen pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
More and more people came, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began re-appreciating the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She's 90% black these days.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a dark red fondness, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and muddled like any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to college in Eatonville to work in the city administration or the police, who, according to him, could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who go through only here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, you speak fluently financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, they have the worst day of horror work every day since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers still push the metal tea wagons along sidewalks with loud flaps and transport trays loaded with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos still slurping between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting on the pavements for their breakfast bagels and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 4 pm and 7 pm.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the doomsday talk.
Although I had decided to lay my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them in front of me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood queued for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying that they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently and quietly bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, went into bankruptcy administration and when last Friday New Yorker drove home for the weekend, Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion in savings, was looking for a rescuing buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and shop employees who stood before me brought their cash to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have acquired fluid finance in the last few weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese regular supermarket referred with so much familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the busted bank and its emaciated-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has strayed from our usual entertainment about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going in a risko anymore."
Muslem graves defiled during right-hand slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed out with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of grave desecration in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend on which extreme right-wing parties recorded considerable profits in the country's parliamentary election.
On the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but detectives consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way connected with the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" about the news of the grave desecration that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan came to an end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law in their campaign, and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets by arguing that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme right is the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
International lockout for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, was prohibited from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday, after submitting evidence of Glitter's criminal record of child sexual abuse to the judges.
Glitter, the real name of Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
Ein Spokesman of the Court reported: "On Thursday, September 25, the police asked Kent at the Ashford District Court for permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
According to the sex offenders register, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
The Kent police said they wouldn't discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's police unit said, "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our opinion, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the highest concern of the Kent police to protect the residents of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse on 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong after a while.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22nd and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
‘I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character,' Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco photography program, 'reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character is in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the Festival 'Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer Flamenco understands: 'music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only dance, singing or instrumental play in itself, but also the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of the El Fotómata in the near future.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sports' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me to `it's very nice to photograph the people, to get to know them and to put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a long time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of today's flamenco portraits entitled 'Flamenco-people' is on display in the El Fotómata Gallery, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the Alameda de Hércules Street. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he's just writing is 'a foolishness'.
He does not yet know where the novel's plot takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he deals with is ‘a foolishness' and ‘everything points out that he doesn't have to write the novel'.
‘If I were contemplative, I wouldn't have done it, but I'll do it and hope to end the novel at some point,' so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and gave her voice to most of those present, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found out that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, who wanted to experience 'extraordinary adventure', 'joy of reading' and 'more' than before'; how he wrote and 'discipline' to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentaries, numerous corrections and revisions that he made; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what 'memorial images' it is that form the basis for his stories.
The Hispanic-American novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure and from where one can know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', Vargas Llosa emphasized, who claims that it ‘can cause effects' and ‘makes people even more different', so I asked the writers ‘not to leave themselves to ease' and ‘take over responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play along: Bullfighting festivals were partially cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be concluded, was moved to yesterday morning.
With the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus the festival was exposed to the volatile weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had achieved more by galloping than by his bullfighting.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience reacted in his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the flight.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A.A.J., as reported by the Basque State Interior Ministry.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometers. At that moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee via a country road to a forest area.
The police of Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later led to accurate laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was 'double', so that it did not match the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest for forgery of official documents took place.
The police of Ertzaintza City continue the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as mentioned above, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the drugs seized.
Arrested 28-year-old A.A.J., he was taken to a police department for questioning and will be presented to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown medication.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effect of an unknown medication.
A witness had observed how she tried to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokesmen of the California traffic police reported to the magazine 'People'.
The witness explained in detail that Locklear pressed through the accelerator after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the witness, who at first probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby street and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she was 'afraid to live for Locklears'.
When the police patrol came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street blocking traffic.
'She seemed disoriented,' so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperatively, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'Following the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medication,' said the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and taken to a local detention centre around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona hospital after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the United Left Association of Andalusia be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, VL's main coordinator and United Left MP, today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
‘In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take over responsibility for this,' Llamazares pointed out, pointing out the approach the party must take towards the one who is currently serving as a city councillor on the Seville municipal council.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive the maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that the formation has 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero Book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' presents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for filming.
In this way, the Cineast tried to 'represent a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he had always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, is presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on the telemadrid station as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this filming work, his ‘childhood dream' was fulfilled. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second century celebration on November 2nd in Madrid. Especially because the story is based on the basis of 'Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, made for shooting by the autonomous community of Madrid, offers Garci, as he added, the 'unique possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain', which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been put behind in the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not count on funding such as `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', has been involved in his usual way of working: he set himself on the stage to the actors with whom you have to rehearse first before you start shooting and for those who had not done casting, he appeared 'humidifying' and giving respect, 'a part of the film director's profession is to provide help in theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many actors he encounters in `Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (one of which he won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year is a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally also not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
'In the beginning you think you're working for the progeny, and later you realize that it's only for prosperity, and now you're happy when you've produced a movie,' explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first female fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and supported the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the interwar period.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell about her life, but to keep her esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance principles helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly' seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic realm,' she claims.
The production anticipates two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I am very honored.'
The production also anticipates musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were divas, whom he always falls in love with.'
In this work one also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
'I wanted to recall it, because I think it is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain epoch and whose works no longer know how to appreciate it,' Bayón claims.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 at the Theater Lopé de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture to celebrate the ‘Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of the two.
Thus, ‘the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The USA can hardly imagine without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then dominant idea of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from the whole of America to Newman with his inspiring performance and followed her.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, that was a big blow for everyone.
'What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest drolls of his life.'
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
As the 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died at a sad moment when fear of terrorists and the market collapse reigns, when the depressed self-esteem of the Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If, in this hard time without virtue, few people remain who can be admired, then you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses and profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from his first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of home-made and organic products.
All of this is a gift to the country where it took a lot of effort to get ahead of a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of astonishment beats skyrocketing Hollywood without taking account of nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of all of us,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: to maintain high standards of integrity, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even impossible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He divorced once and was then married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
‘What should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, none he was as proud as those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropist,' they say.
The streets in Madrid are deficient for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, ‘Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect road, and according to my assessment, it was the worst road with everything around it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it out, that would clearly not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticketing, which allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you proceed, they should give you everything (including a chip to avoid the traffic jams on the road).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of going there only because) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
In addition, in those 40 minutes of waiting for rain, there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the outcome was wrongly stamped.
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect road, I would never think of this road.
So I think we'll be dreaming of a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the company's campus).The system observes what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also place those present in the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, ‘the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person does not belong to the group that is talking to her, and that he is not a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about the change of strategy from Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary things, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or another feature and `extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, this was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the 'window'.
What does half of the applications present in the computer serve?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsoft is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without a doubt, and I am setting a small example.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink machine: `Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google for web research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not be published at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso used it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the countless stars appearances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called ‘Marcel' in a narrow circle. Legend tells that the name formation is connected to sport and comes from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' dominates all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (kaum recognisable) that have these T-shirts as a detail at the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not only focusing on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton trousers, t-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a pity to use them as undergarments.
You're very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great presence with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joie de vivre.
At the moment, the Gruz siblings take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, that means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her residence and also made the presentation of the most important awards in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, I am also fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe so, but after all, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was little, I've been excited about the clothes; I've always wanted to go to my grandmother's place to roam around my aunt's clothes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch out for the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in classes and rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real acting role.
Finally, everything is linked together, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You've just turned 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, than thirty-year-olds, I feel good.
I think the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother, because that's what my body wants, and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise it with much love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you participated in and were filmed last year.
That's exactly how it is, and I want them to be presented to the public.
As a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless and I want everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for some time, just called and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothes from our Mango collection were auctioned out to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers, who can become relapsed because of the alcohol level, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in drunken condition. If he is alcoholic, the car will not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General's Office. According to them, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office, experience shows that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers, who were reported more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol, were back at the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents car start when the driver has made alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of the regulatory violations in the first year after its introduction.
Spain is expected to save 115 lives a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be carried out in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish markets, even though it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow of all days, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which Prince and Princess of Asturias traveled.
The sun went down, but her rays still forced her hand to be used as a parasol to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people with you at the airport at this time of night.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, well, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 soldiers of the navy who give up the salve of honor.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps was told that there was a thunderstorm in DF expected.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official entourage waits.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium fashion and there was probably no much outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and international increase of young fashion talents.
This prize is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the Mango store window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest store is in London.
So many events have happened that are connected with the fact that one would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother died recently, pulls himself together. He dressed the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from Elah, which were breathtaking. He held himself at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the Baron von Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they borrowed from the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hastened to the store and had a pair of trousers and a shirt, which she modeled herself, and at dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got excited, remembered the old days, grabbed a pole and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic and fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all gathered in a book that says how to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that the current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of how to turn away from the world of work.
The number increases, however, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 ways to relax' and so the rest that the book conveys comes to the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this handbook refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes proposed, which lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be terrified, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is not a single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often connections with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stress situations or excessive stress.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks, whispers or it can be quite the opposite in individual words (scream, crying, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to seek advice from a specialist in order to check whether there is a problem, which causes fear and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, be it, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and something too wild.
The nervous children who are recommended to relax can use relaxation methods to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep quiet.
Remember that it's harmless to the child, and the next day, it won't remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of your sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be fearful after a couple, it is recommended to seek advice or to find out why the child is afraid.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
So you won't be able to do anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the child that you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It's a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, this is a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäuser is finally back on track for success.
Without great effort, the yellow-blacks scored numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers had trouble showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long shot just passed the angle, Illhäusers was to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded alternately first Fonderflick with a long shot, then Brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and let through only the lively riahi at the head of the storm.
The beginning of the second half was to be decisive, with two goal chances won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, which was just right to take a ball again, which had been rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the Illhäusian goal scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, whereby his teammates had to continue playing in numbers.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems to an ill-haeusian elf, which only withdrew a little to 'compromise' their defenses, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen, who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to arrive in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, founded by the Breton fishermen, in order to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record level of over 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to the press spokesman of the Elysée Palace David Martinon, ‘the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the employment conditions and pay of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvado, causing traffic jams of almost ten kilometres in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement expanded to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to take place in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', for 'the fishermen will not give in at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', said Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer at his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes said goodbye to the movie legend and the committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer complies with its 2008 supply forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the impending recession, to be a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, complies with its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes for much of the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider delivering more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, is considering delivering more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion advanced.
AIG is willing to drive the sale of a large part of its business beyond its life insurance at international level and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation was obtained at AIG.
Among the assets from which AIG might be separated is its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, continues the FT.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make sales in order to repay the loans of more than 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historic case of prices: the Dow Jones lost 6,98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final launch figures, the Nasdag index, mainly concerning technology, has fallen by 199.61 points to 1.983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index has fallen by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already collapsed at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 against, the MPs refused the funds he had asked for from the Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'This is where a bad picture is circulated that makes Congress incapable of adopting a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, fearing that a project that was adopted in several days would be 'too late'.
‘If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the Fed's (American Central Bank, ed.) and other central banks' task to get the crisis under control, which would limit credit conditions even more,' warned Brian Bethune, Head of Business at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, emphasizing the feeling of extreme urgency even more, that 'every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial company' in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy up Wachovia's banking business by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are facing ‘not just an American crisis but a global one', the FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenue of the Treasury within ten years fell Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and the revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in the first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel for the election of both Republicans and Democrats, which was to be persecuted by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite handsome, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published a five-point opinion poll on Saturday (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat is clearly the better figure.
With the undecided voters, i.e. those who are now important, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls with 39%, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,' but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop focusing on his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, emphasizing clearly his opponent's 'naïvety' on these issues, which were the focus of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama does not seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,' he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself in a short and precise way, without being disfigured.
He brought his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has of the United States.
'McCain still hasn't understood, but Obama has,' said this weekend, a democratic campaigning spot, in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis that is on the 'American off the road'.
‘During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,' Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He didn't even mention the words 'middle class' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could be a decisive turning point,' estimated the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is ‘the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After stressing once again that he would probably even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates were mindful of the questions that arose on the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?'
Young people and oppositionists demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday evenings since the closure of the polling stations on the Minsk Market Square to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't even choose: 'What good is it if they do what they want with my voice anyway,' says a teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-granting of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, it wasn't them.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting,' regretted Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
When members of the opposition move into Parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition therefore owes itself to interfering in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stressed that the voter turnout figures seemed too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk voters) paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election has taken place?, asks the leader of the social-democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most in line with the government's ideas. '
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Conversation - Of Blood That Has Been Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
It is known that during the 1980 ' s, national blood reserves administered by the Red Cross's blood donation service were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to draw up guidelines to prevent another disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to give his report, several provinces set up a committee at that time, whose aim was to develop a new system for managing blood canned blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide for the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood supply system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood cans and through the work in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence,' she says, before proudly emphasizing that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman who has been in charge since its inception in 1998.
And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we were referring to one of the main guidelines of Krever and Gélineau's reports, according to which we are applying exclusion measures if we do not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proved that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has quite a meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which allow the presence of the virus itself directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the previously used tests.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not see it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one in every 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV - infected blood.
`In other words, this means that 12 million canned blood must be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 units of blood each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transmitted via a unit of blood.
I think you can feel comfortable these days when you get or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore your health,' says Hema-Quebec's directorate.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
Only last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through insects over the blood.
We need to monitor continuously,' continues Dr. Décary, before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide a sufficient supply in addition to a secure supply.
`The demand is rising because the population is ageing.
Since the cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only accounts for 3% of Quebec's population. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is widespread are excluded from blood donation for a year.
`With these 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep it and make it become regular donors.
Life is so hectic nowadays that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,' regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only delivers blood canned tissue, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively in serious burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia.
`A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand annually.
‘We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,' explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
‘Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders, qualified for the second round of the quarterfinals at the Saputo Stadium, in which the overall score was counted, and won the semi-finals of the USL's first-league finals.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without goal for both the one side and the other, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for the Montreal Formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that in the first game of the pre- and rematch series on Friday Impact had brought a 2 to 1 defeat to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semifinals, Impact will compete with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota's second round by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved into the semifinals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Victory Gate by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass into six preparatory games in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the whole shooting.
`I am not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable. '
`He fixed too much on it in the first half, remarked Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause. '
Charest is betting on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general assembly of the liberal party was over, Jean Chalest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's partial election.
'Moving the course of our last great border in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Chalest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the liberal Quebec Party in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed by Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Big means like during the parliamentary term.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even though he said that his schedule was very busy.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned recently in the Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49th parallel - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, investment sum or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, there are some prospects of more work being done: above all on water energy, on forests, but especially on the mining sector, supported by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Chalests, the north has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as large as France' 'is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just near us, it's in us,' he stressed, as to show clearly that he's trying to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it's our future,' he added, after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he said.
In addition, ‘with climate change we need to rethink our vision of the North', he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be passable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist Member of Ungava), have already begun discussions with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large gathering, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North plan will be 'spoken, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Chalest described this 'vision' as a continuation of the liberal prime minister who was in office before him.
Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to transform the challenges into new growth and development channels.
This was, by the way, one of the frequently raised topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power station in Adélard-Godbout dam.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,' said Jean Chalest.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that the project was scheduled to start in 2012.
'This remains between us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which caused them to fall.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible to him by law.
He stresses, however, that his schedule is full, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend general assembly provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from "constitutional goals" that were readily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the "characteristicity of Quebec" in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition accepted the guidelines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has revived the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would have gone much further today', Ms. Marois, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), judged Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has advocated supporting the government's adoption of a North Plan.
'But what we want is that this is not just a big idea,' said the party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (what irony) in Harper's cabinet, was the one who allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'fault' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to be so humiliated, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home her compatriot, who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things happened to him were being accused.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate under inhumane conditions.
The only one who descends into a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let's remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Association in particular are pleading for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not interest them that a young adult, after so many years of suffering, will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries in front of him like a flag, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morale: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and incarceration a Canadian citizen, according to the good wishes of a head of government, who is still only supported by the minority (it may be part of the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this sacking, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-Director General of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
It confirms, and follows an orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company sought a slander suit of six million against three authors and a small penniless publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of libel charges, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin everyone who dares to express one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the trial proceeds, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual settlement that silences the opposite side and also deters anyone who dares to revisit the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not by clubs.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate through which newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and, at the same time, disregard the views of the public?
Apparently, in the Vice-President's world, this word only includes generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does this mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a gag (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the truth-finding that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to control debates and inconsistencies and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the university world, as well as to the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that restrict this type of unjustified complaint.
Wall Street Rescue - Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking Wall Street for months, still needs to be adopted by the two Congressional Chambers.
The main content is: better control of Members of Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money used, new orders to reduce the number of houses seized due to arrears of payment, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber of Deputies, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,' said the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
'Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,' the Democrat explained.
'This is the fundamental point: if we do not, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily life of Americans will be enormous,' declared Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two US presidential candidates, who only took part late in the negotiations, were more likely to support the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain injunctions to the agreement, especially those that should allow owners to keep their homes, and those that concern the salaries of senior employees of the state-saved companies.
‘If taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary,' he said on American television stations.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
'The guiding principles that I have read show that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to progress.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at using taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime) before it expanded to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freeze of financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed last week's first attempt to reach an agreement.
Since the democrats accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, one believes that the dead end will escape.
In order to round off the perspective for everyone in Congress, an order has also been added, which states that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes in order to recover its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that pay dividends in the event of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the pawning procedures concerning the housing linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan, and also to set deadlines for repayment and severance payments paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate to vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, there were more votes against yesterday, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
'It's obvious Washington doesn't understand us', Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Finance Commission, explained to his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one who is asking taxpayers to pay'.
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called the 'Caucus of Skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to be put under pressure, and carefully consider which way to go,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe once again received proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who is in great difficulty since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate for this, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households value, now that uncertain times are coming. '
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British Government was just about to nationalize another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bradford and Bringley bank, including over $41 billion ($75,5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has had to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Was the American actor freed from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters into the world.
But what a long-time runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema he has spent golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more carefully in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the blasting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often yields wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality.
Because it reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was injured in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success on theatre, television and soon also in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became second in the 1979 24-hour race of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a showcase relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it also the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and oversensitive star to the glamour of the show business disappear, whose riddle will never be solved completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death put the cinema lovers in tumbling this weekend, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing with him.
There the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is remembered again, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot tin roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is awakened, which is due to his sensitive Mr Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, who was re-recorded after his death and made the Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), who was awarded the Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the times, that was him.
Still him.
His curriculum vitae unites epochs.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
In 2003, Sam Mendes was the founder of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition.
Unlike several movie legends who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, its fortune, its pomp and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he judged his too expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flowed for a long time.
However, he played Sunnyboys less often as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fiends or desperate ones, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slipping away and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
During the flood of honors that poured out on Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gun partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said very deeply: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential qualities of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drift, is now going there.
We often saw him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was quite tasteless, although we thought it was funny at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Always and until the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And it was an honor for us to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zucker &amp; Co.?
On 8 October negotiations will begin in the criminal trial against Jáno's strike and his accomplices.
In particular, the defendants are accused of participating in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and of other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor's office, the funds generated by the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often invoiced with fake invoices.
State funds and subsidies from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have flowed partly into the funds of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private funds of individuals.
As the investigative authorities have announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received, and the associations should not have complied with their obligations either.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were forged.
The bill blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision as to which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on that round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados was sent by Jáno's supplement.
In the course of this "exploratory tour" Lado's guesthouses and restaurants were to be found.
He asked for invoices about the consumptions in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest based on these templates.
These bills are said to have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice, András ̄ri, who, according to our information, was responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "Exploration Tour" was a beer restaurant.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by supplement and co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety-strong group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious formal and content errors.
130 guests are said to have stayed in a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time.
The fantasies of the forgeries of the accounts were apparently just as limited when it came to the Pigal Kft., a catering company in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá do not even appear according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas of hvg.hu told him, he immediately realised that it was fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the prosecution during an interview.
"Our company name and tax number were misplaced on the stamp."
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the company was supposed to have accommodated one hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that could not possibly accommodate so many people was also wrong.
Food was also mentioned on the bill, the restaurant had not been in operation for a long time.
The fraudsters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they are targeting offers only travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary's journeys on the cash account, which is also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As the investigation has revealed, they have also mentioned VAT on invoices, although travel agency services related to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company only charges 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and the employees only issue machine invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made to the "invoicing agencies" was that in one case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor's office informed.
Further formal errors - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as forgeries.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managing directors claimed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" was committed by the forgerers at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in fact in disarray at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that he had not issued the invoices himself.
Consciously faked
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they had to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with surcharge and co. In 2003, the GmbH is said to have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület associations with fake invoices for the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to non-performance.
However, there were no payments either, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, but what the data subjects forgot to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall comprise persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based, but non-findable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the total value of HUF about 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have been the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation Kubatov has confessed to having issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to having collected their equivalents themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons at Iván Kubatov's express request.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices for the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were added to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but have used these amounts for other purposes.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictitious bills to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were, by the way, secured during the search of the Árpád Kemecsei office in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to confess to the procedure of forgery, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main accused Jáno's bid for a comprehensive confession decides.
His information so far was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report on everything on a number of occasions, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, then, whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of the bulk of the damage incurred at HUF 50 million, and whether supplement is willing to take responsibility in return.
It is quite possible, however, that the "offended person" is now playing, after his requests for mitigating the detention and house arrest had come to deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have caused far greater damage with economic crimes and have not paid them, are free of charge, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied.
The psychology of outbidding - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was to play lottery, while the other was to participate in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain cortex, was measured with losers of the auction, in which the outbidding of the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to substantiate their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally carried out investigations to trace the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised $15 reward in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that the emphasis was on winning one while the other was on losing the other.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" playing group were willing to play higher stakes than those in the control or "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
They have so far only justified the behaviour observed at auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation ready" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in the case of hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), in the case of hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. semen, vaginal secretion or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against the viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against the virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
Thereafter jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B-induced, far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only 1 in 10 people are infected with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular control checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected in routine laboratory tests, it is advisable to visit the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized in good time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
30 September is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Are believers less in pain?
As recent research has shown, religious faith acts like a kind of "pain" that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: to what extent belief in God influences human feelings of pain, the British paper "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
The results showed that believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of brain-scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would create a kind of religious trance while choosing da Vinci's image because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, receiving a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during that time, while viewing either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics reported that when they saw the Mother of God, they felt "in safety" as if they were "concerned", and they felt "rest and peace".
While viewing the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than when they saw Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that with other strong-acting images one could also cause similar effects with the atheists, one would just have to find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find an image that creates very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practising faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases," says Wright.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains of what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that it is found in people's pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he points out that these would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information in this world."
Schmidt explained that Google is still at the beginning of collecting information after ten years of world-changing work.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so, as they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms are registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and then to use it later so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on previous preferences.
However, the users wonder what happens in the event of data abuse - "If you look what I do" - some people are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that has a terrifying effect, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the revolt against the power that many Internet users are opposed to.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights could still breathe in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully brought the FBI to justice: therefore, Google cannot be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request with any point of the constitution in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but it has been deprived of the list of individual users or their web and search terms list for two months retrospectively.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who hate to release their personal data, because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google services, scour the company with the indignation due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is market leader thanks to Windows, even if both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes to its users and provides its services free of charge, making an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks look through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet in a sharp way - a relationship that has become the focus of particular attention in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, i.e. the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can manage his profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook via Xanga, can connect it with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. Furthermore, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are cast on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at last night's party photos, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has been enjoying himself with, or the employee is dismissed because in his blog he is only too honest about his anger about corporate management - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Those who lead an online life are what they reveal of themselves - in such a way one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even avoid the Google monopoly, can like to do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
However, public opinion waits for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the ever-faster-run services are causing not only Microsoft but other software developers to worry.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counter-poles: for example, the Corporate Executive Board completely rejected a protest by the employees after the fees of the company's kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the multiple meals of the employees were too expensive. However, all this seems almost mild against the fact that Google even fell to the knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed with an agreement that all the dissident hits, or those who violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could turn a lot around again: While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now assuming scale that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the material - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best Orwellian manner a future in which a person becomes frighteningly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double murderer of Ózd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping with the removal of the tracks, said the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod on Tuesday.
The young people were decent and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, they are two girls who defend themselves at large.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was detained on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to settle his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a gun hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon as well as the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes an offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange's share packages.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reiterated the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which, however, intends to sell more than 60% of the securities in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As reported by the newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all those interested in the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroons.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, a number of leading European pages already spoke on Tuesday of "second 11 September".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example, "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to get his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, the danger is that Washington will not have a political means for crisis management.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, says the Geneva "day-indicator".
While some states could still provide bailouts to their troubled financial institutions, they could save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then no more financial injections or other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weak financial institutions, the Viennese "Der Standard" recalls. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, after the Americans, European taxpayers must now also take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis that is now sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
Although the "saviors" would not have to "sweep" at once with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, in which the Nissan engineers were inspired by Hummeln in the creation of new accident-avoiding systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by automotive robots, a mini-car equipped with bees' characteristics, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development, said at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers picked up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If not, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Autorobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect bees' behavior when evading other bees.
And this has to take place in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, do not dodge up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the twistability of the tires.
While there are endless possibilities open to the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotational movement, or the acceleration and braking of the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life span than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to some inputs per second.
It doesn't need to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction based on previous maneuvers, so that it constantly uses only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for megabyte and megabyte memory.
This is the first step in the development of instant collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could be the technology used in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately driving the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is the written version of the $700 billion bailout law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying the banks' bad loans.
In the first passage half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight East Coast, Congressmen ran through the $700 billion bailout after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives of the United States, and said that the agreement had only to be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain - supported the compromise reached on the bailout.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson commented on the result: The programme will be effective and efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the helm of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington's Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (mid-European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first votes on the 2008 bill on economic stabilisation, then the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of lazy securities subject to loans.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress will vote on the Causa on Monday, as expected. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-impaired, bad securities, and the President will decide on the further USD 100 billion.
The programme shall be reviewed by a separate Commission, which shall also be a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another Congress decision.
In accordance with the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgaged securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can take place both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay the expected damages corresponding to the charges.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid for the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, says Paulson.
However, the bosses of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect their clearances, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang salopp, to be cut by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry buys in an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the retired bank manager is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of bad loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managers' salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers' salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains equity rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank get better.
The bill stipulates that the president must submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who were also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008 and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year's prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices rose only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry also rose little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, and for shoes, prices were 2.5 percent high.
Higher prices of plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased the prices of chemicals and productions (1.6 percent).
Price declines were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and slightly in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, as well as in publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of manufacturing, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent was measured.
In the major domestic markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry in comparison with the previous year, crude oil processing prices have risen most sharply (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages and tobacco was 11 percent.
A fall in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The rate of inflation in the other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 percent.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2% last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in the investment goods sector in August (0.7 percent).
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while they remained the same in the energy and processing sectors compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sectors compared to the same period in 2007 (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was noted, and in the fixed goods sector a price reduction of 1.4 percent was noted.
Industrial export prices measured in Forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency grew by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, by 7.1 percent weaker to the dollar, and compared to the price of August 2007, it grew by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and even by 15.9 percent stronger to the dollar.
No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force around January 12, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her opinion, "everything depends now only on whether the electronic immigration or control system overseas is introduced in time."
However, she also stressed that the new system would not allow entry, but that tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and she will also hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the finance minister.
After day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning, the Congress and representatives of the government announced that they had come to an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The crisis on Wall Street and the thawing of the frozen credit market became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's Hoch, who brought him the presentation of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted away at the same time.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly adopt the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened" - he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolet".
In an interview given to ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have a hard time knocking on it (...) but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control committee for the finance minister, as well as the limitation of clearances for top managers - something he had insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution annihilates its fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now it is the modern citizens who turn away from them.
The break of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as for Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU did not occur quite surprisingly, but something came to an end on Sunday, which, however, was already evident quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
Because already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7% and thus fell below the 50-percent mark for the first time since the fifties
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in other words in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization, which was consistently carried out by the CSU in the federal state, has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time estimated at a considerable pace. However, the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in the last few weeks, almost the classical groups of citizens expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with high school degrees such as university degrees.
Here the support of the CSU fell to even below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative daily Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders reluctantly in coalition questions" titled articles on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the interference of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it's all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly let their cards look into it.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very much possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP leader as vice chancellor.
As he said, the voters voted off the bowl-torture course.
A repetition of this direction would not be possible.
Molterer has, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tried to interfere with internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition, or coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally by ÖVP.
BZÖ boss Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider says.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which will be hosted by the EU Presidency of France this year.
In her speech to the plenary session, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party, drew attention in particular to the educational segregation, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and which is the biggest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to Fidesz MEPs' press office, Járóka has drawn attention to the fact that, in addition to discrimination in job search, the Roma are forced out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education only a small part of them can obtain a university degree".
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education was a fundamental human right, which would play a key role in the promotion of other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the honourable Member's view, it is important that these links become as broad a circle as possible, i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and VAT they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped" - said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, targeted and action-oriented approach by the European Union is needed to speed up the desegregation process in the education sector, and it is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"We must break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen," Járóka said.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the promotion of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level, in line with the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
CSU: Grace to Time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are yet rolling, at the head of the Bavarian CSU the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
However, the much-told duo already let it see that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
They want to appease the angry faction and the party base, who demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the top of his career - the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "all-in-one" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of German GDP.
The Conservatives remain the dominant force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party's internal restructuring, the potential successor Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP and the right-wing "free voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate comes from the fact that with the list "Free Voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first took advantage of, and then mercilessly dumped the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings from the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called 28 September the "bitter day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made a few toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to success at national level in 2005, is not set up again with a joint force act, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the parliamentary elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the ground loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in counting the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not accepted the elections.
De Legislature of the 10-million-inhabitant state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opponent gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006 renewed his presidency mandate for the fourth time, would "let" some members of the opposition in parliament this time.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia thanks to rising prices for gas imports. For the relief of price increases, even loans have been raised, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. So, in the background to the opposition's expectations, there was hope that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have been banned from entering the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
A temporary relaxation was provided by the OECD election evaluation report, which focused more on positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's Rapid Report criticised the campaign already on Monday - thus oppositionists are not likely to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
In spite of all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, and Minsk is even willing to face smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper forms a federal state, has considered the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich said to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opponent into parliament".
The opposition does not plan any protest measures in the light of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way in the distribution process, but still I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich in allusion that not even the most supported class of pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it's just a matter of time before the "social security" reminding of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the actions, not the words". The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure against which those smart-minded people who first stamp and then go for coffee during their working hours will come into force.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Council of Ministers Bureau.
">"Rollable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through higher attendance rates and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta stresses once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation ends in all the buildings of the Council of Ministers' Presidium.
Masi says: "The choice of the rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours anymore; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. works wonders".
During a meeting of the Higher Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister of Rome announces that "in three months the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, that is 60,000 more people are present at work every year".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration.
"their wage dynamiques - according to the Minister - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to counteract the Brunetta decree in the context of the Codacons-supported appeal.
"While the Minister for the Civil Service is showing figures about lower absenteeism at work - the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'working sluggards' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker during which inspection visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy there are 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 remain incapacitated for life.
For the year 2007 the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul Lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will mark the 58th national day for victims of accidents at work in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the importance of prevention in the workplace," confirms Pietro Mercandelli, President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del Lavoro).
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing work, protecting injured workers, helping victims' families and raising public opinion".
"A outrageous "basta" has risen up to this, understandable in tragedies that, in terms of their scale, trigger some whirlwinds in the media and public sympathy. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is, in any case, also a resource problem: there must be a decisive investment in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of the educational context by young people who are feeding on the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not distract it from its social seriousness. It is necessary to implement and improve a legislative norm.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not rule out the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," says Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you think you're basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting at school."
"Another effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is in demand".
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is, therefore, to give the worker a guarantee on insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player on charges: danger of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report states in a note that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music equipment for at least five years per week for more than one hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – that is what the EU says – show a clear risk that pushes too fast to act.
What really matters is to raise consumers' awareness and to make this information a common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - the EU Communication concludes - confirm that there is a good deal of concern and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and stakeholders, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music equipment and similar equipment".
There is already a European standard which limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB.
This damage can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the European Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices listen to loud music only five hours a week (in fact, 89 decibels) so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this line risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This would therefore affect 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the future of the capital"
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, and we're taking stock in June.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," emphasizes Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the municipal and municipal councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will be disbanded, as such a project must have a timed end point.
In June - as the Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Anyone who questions the Commission's competence, because their opinion is lacking in commitment, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in view, so as to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to specifying the following: "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think. It will occupy the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step towards the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, "which will not only limit itself within the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in terms of Rome's role as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much interested in being seen as independent, has written: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy through his decisions and who had relations with the hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private man).
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!".
In fact, these attacks don't have much to say; they're racist attacks and they don't answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there's the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
In this case, too, there are people who talk to the heart and not the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the election booth will we know who the real American patriot will vote.
Here comes a mentality of the USA, which has been kept hidden up to the last.
"If you say what you want, we'll decide who we're going to do our creuching for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority the weak point of Bush.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts, and many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern at the general credibility of the information concerning those responsible.
You don't feel as alone as you used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the major problems caused by the cutbacks in the newsroom, the space in which the editors work to put the newspaper together.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear, but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, executives even account for 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web is going.
The most important publishing groups pave the way to the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" experienced by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they wanted to join the new technology in the hope of "bringing something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national editors are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work".
The managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
It is 30% among journalists.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editor", note d. Red.) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a vast nation, as the US is, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers as it is popular with them and so it becomes a matter of taking it or leaving it.
The editors often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As far as holidays are concerned, it is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, and so many after the third, to reach 15 days of holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEAVES IN GROTT-TAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Trial Chamber of the Court of Rome, decided to reject the real estate agent's application, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is investigated for Bankrot in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (against which the prosecutor's office had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and obtain evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's $700 billion savings package: a large part of the Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which reports how the crisis is dividing the Republican party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favoured state institutions and business community, and the neoconservative that is hostile to "the Washington and financial worlds" and wins voters, especially in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or even already represents: not only in the US, but also throughout the West, and perhaps beyond that, will be affected by it.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage a huge amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This is an immediate political problem for governments: how to behave towards the affected families, which are also an enormous mass of voters.
So the crisis seems economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism in itself seems to have lost its right to speak: the EU has given clear proof of this, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone is now expecting the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: since the crisis became increasingly serious, only the US has been in the economic situation to save itself without foreign help.
And in addition to the resources, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two conditions that cannot be overvalued – under certain circumstances – which otherwise no international organisation and no market will be able to rely on in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, perfectly in line with the ever greater importance recently attached to a closely related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now that we have been so convinced that we have long since entered a networked realm, into a realm of ever-different technologies, of the intangible, that we have to realize at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other in the world, but are still extremely connected to a closely defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in advantage over another who lives in a harvestless, waterless, or oil - free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short boost.
Who says territory, who says government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation about the existing leaderships, especially those of economics, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of insensitivity, a sense of distance, all directed towards a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among large sections of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is presented to the majority as ever more foreign and traditional.
The demand for leadership therefore feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of disempowerment of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the sudden change of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in the UK, towards the rebellion of the American deputies against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today and is being intensified and driven to over-dimensionality by the financial crisis.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that goes up against walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have almost reached its destination.
With an adhesive applied on a surface of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The adhesive principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged into a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "removes them without problems from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a perishable adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
For example, to rise on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other fields of application could fall within the space sector.
So for the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – including the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a microfiber adhesive that, like hair, cleans itself from dust by moving on a surface and thus always retains a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain essential medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices in combination with medication. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again raised the alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the point that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger patients' health.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular medications, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICATIONS IN DANGEROUS – The same drug agency had warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mixture in a report two years ago and stressed that they should be careful about what is being drunk in conjunction with medicines such as diazepan or metadon.
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal made by Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually passed on immediately to the various international manufacturers who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still ambiguities, not to have a pharmacist or doctor to ask you," says Ansa Agency expert.
Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial in the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the US than the assassinations.
A prediction that received not a little polemics in response and was held up to the economist years later, but now proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of OpenOffice.org 3.0's release has come; the Open Source software, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, gains an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with a few novelties: in addition to a revised and now more spartan designed start menu, a completely guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is finally achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version, given.
In addition, eight has been added to Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes sending via email easier, for example. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which extend the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a table and a word processing system.
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed multi-handedly by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a Frabe to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if the cost-freeness can be an incentive for the spread of the programme in private households, it is also particularly in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed the big throw: after all, various institutions of public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program, which aims at a displacement of Excel; Impress, for creating presentations as with PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the more known Access; and finally Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also positive tested cabbage and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping fall will open up as part of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to have been tested positively on Cera, the third-generation epoetin. Previously, this was the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as with the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage are among those made in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epoetin test and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAG: IS ITALIA RASSISTICAL?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with reluctance.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy, which begins with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, who was born in Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a pack of cookies.
The case bears witness to what the Times calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are those where "the most integration and job opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support for the Lega Nord is recorded".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement which the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Student victims of rents up to 900 euros per room
The housing market for students knows no crises.
According to the last study by the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 euros in Naples and 600 euros in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features. Quite a lot of students lose their right to study, because their families are unable to support them at this level" – according to Sunia's leaders, Laura Mariani – "in these cities, the great demand on the part of the students leads to a deforming of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rents.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures which lead to lower rental prices by revising taxation.
If you look at the study, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere quarter) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera quarter or even 900 euros in the Vittoria quarter.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a sleeping place, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little lower are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who dodge in outer districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350 euros.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting out to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% higher than the average is demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favored multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the one-room cinema in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the features of a cultural crime.
Most of the time, historical places are full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you have covered a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the big prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It's the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these mines paid for the most part the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy lists, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first and foremost there is the preservation of the already existing, because closes a hall in the city, not all of its regular customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association out of eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed every year".
It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to its fears about the old cinemas, decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be possible to travel to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a gratifying initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because after all, the audience is more demanding today.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid seeing the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the Anti-Mafia Office of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of Gioia Tauro municipality, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Disrespectful of any kind of moral and legal standard," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations have decided to pay Piromalli the lawyer money for consulting activities."
"So it was made possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls in an official way and to co-determine the politics of the public administration."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, which, according to the police, was beheaded by the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organised crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Central-Right Coalition after the May 2006 elections.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused Vice-Minniti of inventing everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with the arrest warrant issued this morning, explained that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for a change to the A3 project.
From an interception action in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – which made the public administration's actions identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes from the waves, suddenly the big ones come up
It is a non-draining source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now does this seem to be understood by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and are also looking to occupate, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; not by chance have these studies intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil came down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be covered by the ocean waves.
This would be twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides would also be added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are relying on marine energy production.
"Chevron investigates these technologies," says the spokesman for a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs up the opportunity to work with us."
This is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a not to be underestimated sign, especially given that oil is still being extracted by the US in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
Technologies that can be improved.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still on the rise, not least because the last doubts have not yet been resolved by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with far greater influence on the environment are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for the state approval. Part of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a park latz with subsea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotation movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, a particular interest deserves the potential that is in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
