The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first important foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India is also reported to be hoping for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before bouncing into the bushland where the officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the driver's description were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal and ruthless driving.
It is scheduled to appear before the Karratha District Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read at a hearing by the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, asleep, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for 17 November at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
"Just as unions die, middle-class jobs die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the employee empowerment law together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination on the basis of trade union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-unionist forces.
Complementing the National Labour Law to create a possibility for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation in order to bring justice before a civil court - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks the trade unions have suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries around the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and comply with labour laws.
There was a time when millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that Hedki Tojo's militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Conscious that the workers and their trade unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to union and collective bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight urged David Eisenhower and his staff to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; measures aimed at this are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to establish a union - and that this union should then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - had to be protected.
After these rights have been attacked in America, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal, which requires the working population to have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago,
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, labor miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
History remembers, and that's what we should do.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and that have redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say would have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was introduced by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June to enter into force on 1 Sept., would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient's admission right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing will be held for the judge in order to obtain a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the youngest in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors would have more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a devious law that wants to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had sued on behalf of three of the state's five hospitals to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also covered doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a bill in Texas that would have forced most of the remaining hospitals to close down were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions on doctors.
Opponents of abortion oppose the fact that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has a patient's right to be instructed, informed the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their requests for patient representation rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video hommage for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in Australia's rural areas have a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-diseases and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and a lack of access to the best treatment centers as potential factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services to counter the distances, she proposed, as a possible remedy, strengthening the service of doctors flown in to give specialists the opportunity to provide more densely for women at their home, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33, learned from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret declining homeowner numbers
The decline, along with an increased drop in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could lead to gardening centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year when, according to a study by HTA, today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products" as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend on their own homes for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting pre-garden for park purposes, and the decline in garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, where an estimated £5 billion per year is being sold.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them during a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to rising household ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also forecasted an improved market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refuses to do so.
Meanwhile, the country's army calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using violence".
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already made a more frequent coup.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating on the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey Orders U.S. Diplomacy for Espionage Report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's senior US diplomats to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the U.S. Ambassador's business and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that the most important secret service in Germany aimed at Ankara, caused much more angry reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning strike: train drivers threaten consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stand announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. covers all transport companies throughout Germany, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.

said Sven Schmitte, District Chairman of the German Locomotive Drivers' Union (GDL), in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There were no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL had not said where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials from the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca.
The chief of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge-drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, after being accused of corruption.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by policemen and employees of the city of Calvià to the prosecutor's office for the fight against corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption charges and are interrogated by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said the authorities' nepotism had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Get out of the way of our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video featuring an 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during a surf tour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the improper behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-drinked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage jointly have to pay a penalty of €55,000 (73,000 $).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British tourists, is also known for many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
The FRUHLING has provided South Australia with a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong wind, which affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already gone down in the night on Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started just before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shearwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
At this time, winds reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to take off on a second approach and finally set up at about 8.40 p.m.
The delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies thinks: High time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control panels, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
While I'm writing this, I'm looking at the spiral cable that connects the phone to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there's a thought behind it: If the cable wasn't, all the listeners would fly around in the house in no time, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, it is true on the disgusting (ekeltronic?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that today's world first is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And who, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, simply says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because pushing the Ifa at the Funkturm this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman, who used to control washing machines and CD players blindly, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread in front of him with incredible expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What are you supposed to talk about with people who seem to volunteer to spread this quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, it's mainly about the fact that we should connect our house.
So that the yoghurt can re-order itself, so that the fire detector on vacation on the Maldives tells us that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get the air conditioning from the office on our early arrival ...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: We lift our watch, say loudly "eyes!" - and at home the vacuum robot drives off.
Crazy.
Everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring", a sector expert raunts, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steam cooker sends the weather report and the data glasses shows how long the pizza in the oven still needs, which does not help, because we are in traffic jams.
From our daily practice we also know: If a new-style device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in air raid shelters, while rocket and mortar shelling went down on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel, drawn by rocket bullet holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls prior to the arrival of the students.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, which is heavily marked by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and fights, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD ban proceedings
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should be put to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the head of the CDU in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that we are fighting the NPD politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had just failed at the five-percent hurdle during the vote on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at that time also had informants in the NPD top.
In December 2013, after a long period of preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application to Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The central initial reception for refugees in Harburg bursts from all seams.
Now the Interior Department has put up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions further raise citizens' reservations and do not allow district politicians to contribute constructively to the humane housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party demands that the Harburg district administration provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the onslaught of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data of Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
RP Data's research manager, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a split market.
RP Data figures show that home prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while Melbourne increased by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices only rose by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless also said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in the real estate available for sale, which would be "a real test" of the market.
"Looking at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse he contradicts statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to "like a general" to pose.
This is not the style of the university, the communication states.
The Medau family had already been informed orally about the university's intentions in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preliminaries or even decisions", but there are "preferentials".
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for the access, was also less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
There was and is not talk of a nine-meter-wide road.
According to the current situation, it is 5.50 metres wide, which is one metre wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Train parking is not allowed at all, because this can now be intelligently solved as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the Residents
According to the president of the university, the crib Bergwichtel, which is located on the grounds and whose front door would lead the access to the parking deck, should not be "impaired".
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
So it's about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent council of the crib, with the extension of the street would be entitled to a "the few natural spots of Coburg" "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October Pötzl, together with the Staatliche Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the crib about the plans of the university last week.
According to this, the access for the new parking deck should not continue on the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but on the Medau-Berg.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometer in length.
According to the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
About 2000 vehicles per day are mentioned.
So far, the city did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga club SG Flensburg-Handewitt mainly led to health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
Thus, he goes into international retirement with a balance of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go on a goal hunt for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his squad for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my longtime fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available in a healthy way in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed had had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which had later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further procedures followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass by any body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
This is accompanied by some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I can control my head, I can't fool my body," Glandorf explained in an interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be available in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes are broken, I am always ready to talk," the two-time family father explained to the trade magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years I can still play handball.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to at least be able to walk fairly straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and winning the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
He also won the European Cup with Flensburg in 2012.
German economy slumped by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the world slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone stimulated the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent for the first half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organisation of this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We also want to get to know Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city via the Wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were taken care of on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayoral representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organisation went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organiser had hoped, probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend," however, the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers ruthlessly honest memoirs
It's actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, put on paper in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages.
The Munich-born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text, rather than chronologically, but more thought scraps for thought scraps.
And he is ruthlessly honest: from the Onanie as a gymnasium to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also includes abstract, but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom of, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and how not only the music influenced him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his stay in prison.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving away all unnecessary things".
Between all the high-spirited views there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example about fights in a local frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, during which he targeted a tree frontally.
Even there, he's ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in my arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants at Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is contemplative of his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life, he was that serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's day, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep stygic mazes with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry of himself.
As I was walking around, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' feelings of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn't until my mother was sick towards the end of her life that we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed when he was a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theater.
It followed The Comedy of the Mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started working at a factory when he was only 16.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/commedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to play at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
It was very unpleasant for my family.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters that both mocked and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy show Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing time around or kicking a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, whites in pantyhose and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost like somebody finally put my head on.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me, "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they fix the computer."
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That too came well, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny.""
He says this, of course, with a DONNING voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is thwarted by humorous outbursts while he constantly imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're going to go to a wall with it.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo when I feel like it, but overall I don't get as much as I used to.
I'm gonna ask him if he's ever gonna do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shia Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
The access to Parliament had also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdullalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
Shia Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain "spirit workers"
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to remove "spirit workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments after they leave the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the civil service when he took office in 2013.
A review earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost in payments for "spirit workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been communicated in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the salary list, the message read further.
"This approach will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also correcting the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the "spirit workers," said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
That's what a court speaker told me on Monday.
The application states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach had purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He spent 44 years in the school service, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his striving to see man in the disciple.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp in 1946 we went to Bavaria - in the freight wagon.
Thus, Judges took it to the Upper Franconian village of Senfendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers to the next station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the whole city to school and return in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter got a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he made the first and 1954 after three years of teaching candidate the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fraulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved to the newly built teacher's house next to the school a three-room service apartment.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968/69 school year these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew up, and from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to obtain the current building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workshop built on municipal costs and cellars built during the 1997 expansion, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled gratefully.
In his entire career Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a lecture by a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love". Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn: "That doesn't always work". Whether he means only his students or just his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students fought, they didn't get criminal work from him, nor were they sent to detention.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the good of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship as rector with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the non-partisan judge to be at least the last candidate on the CSU list for the local council in 1996.
However, Judges were selected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of rapids alone made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schotten Altenburgpark.
The participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday under the motto "Radeln und feieren auf neu entdeckten Wegen zwischen Nidda und Kinzig" and experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 km over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started cycling in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 tins of apple, plum, sprinkle and cheese cakes, which were wonderfully mouthed to the skilled cyclists.
"Only country women can bake such cakes," praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be bought at the beverage booth of the gymnastics club Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already fixed already skipped bicycle chains again today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the plant manager still had to work: They were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the drinking spa and took the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Tobias Hagen, head of the promotion team since the first hr4 cycle tour in 2004 as tour leader, was only able to take a short nap, but he had to deal with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the Hessian police via three telephones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus, and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Altenburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course they had prepared delicacies, such as flambkuchen with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS managing director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move in the open air was used eagerly despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, there was an increasing mix of citizens who were just as impressed by the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reporting local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal organisation and tapping telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Yatsenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, visiting Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their further life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It arrives with a proud drag of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with Bain and Co., a global management consulting firm, where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She served as Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top post of Pearsons' parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Their severance payments were reportedly close to £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet consultant.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly that calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming chairman would risk taking action, hitting on everything and tearing apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps killing himself.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC smaller - power, money and status overtaken.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable assets, the forthcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the certainly largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households, each of which costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missed programs on my iPlayer later.
But it remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that depressing tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a derogatory remark about the Democratic District Attorney who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's user account, which rejects the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later message.
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although Perry's official user account tweets ran out, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
The former tweet drew an unfavorable picture of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunkenness in April 2013.
Perry vetoed financial support from her office when she refused to resign, leading to a lawsuit against Perry - who might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I charge Governor Perry when he talks it out."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of investigating the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal counsels requested that the judge in charge of the case dismiss the charges and argued that the law against the senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state money to the state's Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County and investigates cases of state corruption in Texas, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in 2012 at the Iowa elections during his presidential candidate, Perry began to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photograph of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market "normal" again
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had "returned" to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and the subject of enormous price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set cap on mortgage loans in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "stable environment of action".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers rushed into the capital.
According to the cadastral office, prices in the urban area alone rose by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling prices of Berkeley's private, inexpensive and student offerings increased by about a fifth last year and were around £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "illegal tax" before the general elections next May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which presented tougher lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on a already weakening house price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year after year, says real estate agent WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital city is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for future sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, future sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes by the end of April – almost a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent to £ 280 million each year, while sales increased by 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the Company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley in the current year are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts consistently estimate the annual pre-tax result at £450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed in London retail in the afternoon at £23.96.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "Die Tribute von Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and charged the hacker with "explained violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will track all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly procured by a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you're really happy with yourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorial" denied, however, that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FEELING, people.
Let's fight back to the beginnings. *Wortplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted, so it was best to describe it, they slowly disintegrated like a cardboard that was left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratchy.
He was stingy, like in hedgehogs, yeah.
The last victim of this stinginess was an affair that had just begun, which had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and harsh than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt and who had inherited a property in a humid but paradisiacal valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, in the baths were still spiders, naked snails had left their marks on all the windows and believed that all this belonged to them, and the garden was covered with weeds, which looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a childhood fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat hand-held with Ailin on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had not entered the service console, which provided the country with calming music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long forgotten black entertainer, whom his father liked to listen to at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obstructed, just like the word obsolescence.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have done, and as people choose books from plates-to-millionaires-memories, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing big feet in a rough-comic serenade of Ailinn.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very funny game back then, and it wasn't very funny now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that's all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of them before.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Just like the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints applied.
A conforming society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group gift - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were, as by nature, blessed with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT WOULD have happened, WHEN IT WOULD have happened, out of fear of being charged with firefighting, out of fear even that the flames would consume them next - had Labneh and Shisha whistle restaurants opened, kept in mind and became depressed with the inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just spoken to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was a little weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head unbelievingly and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see around the world but her uncombed raven black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your big ankles are exactly the reason I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the reassuring charm one needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father also wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from her deck chair, threw the console over and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her arousal, she seemed to be shaking, like palm fronds in the storm.
"And your fathead is exactly the reason why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
He felt sorry for the unnecessarily unkindness of his words and the fear she felt when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as it did there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more disgusting after WHAT WAS Gone when their ancestors had been smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
They first snuggle - snuggling was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the innocuous love ballads from the console - first snuggle them and then beat them.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the snuggling itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt lead, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She watched him move away - as she watched her companion on the upper floor - a man complaining about something he himself had conjured up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well when she could not remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events that have just been told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, worked on a short lecture on continued low and medium-level violence in precisely the parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, is most likely to be expected, in view of the money and energy invested in eradicating this violence.
"A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged and won a thousand wars, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has rarely been felt historically despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some properties turn out to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to awaken.
The population cries while listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates itself with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only the former rawness holds the rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in the hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious quarrel at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum answered.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and refusal of testimony.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a non-prejudiced workplace.
We serve a non-prejudiced society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "hidden" and "raw", could be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you keep riding around on what is GIFT, WHEN IT IS GIFT, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the country's essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you're getting at," answered Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, as she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I'm not saying anything but that we're not yet as effectively healed as we pretend to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that have been made in the first place to WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENED.
But this time it's not the others we're letting go of our anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To suggest an angel's patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you talk about the fact that they would have left out their "wound" and their "mistrust" to "others".
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of "us" and "others" in understanding the past as well as in protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was back then.
Nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as no debt has to be assigned, no debt has to be redeemed if such repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to redeem it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget it.
If there's anything I can say about this...
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said, releasing her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had gone on foot in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup d'état is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official military officials in Lesotho argued that they had planned a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said that they were acting against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said that the country's army had surrounded its headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting on threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no coup d'état in fact, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armed forces were imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defence Forces staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that inside the police some elements actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"Even though no one has claimed to have seized the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Spokesmen of the Lesotho military announced on Sunday that the soldiers would retreat to their barracks and that the situation in the capital would be calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said that he believed that he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there has been great tension since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the clashes in his unitary government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the euro-zone on a 13 month low
The increase in output in the eurozone slowed down in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced break-ins at a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan to deal with a hesitant recovery in the euro area, as well as the threat of deflation at a inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the ECB's head Mario Draghi could provide further information later this week on whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months at 51,4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46,9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism are no longer effective in Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands is also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Business Expert at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing you can say for the August purchasing manager's index of manufacturing in the eurozone is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "Currently, producers in the eurozone seem to find life quite difficult, as current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to lead to delays or even cancellations of some orders, especially large orders.
He said that it would be "more and more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hell Tenth of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity of the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors last night warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that haunts Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back into the school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back into the smashed school gym in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said back then.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need surgery again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people how doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think about a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, even though the memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think that many people are seeing it for the first time, understanding our catastrophe and helping to prevent this happening again.
The boy who fled through the hail of bullets thinks his mother is dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she could be dead, he fled and saw a weeping toddler on the way, grabbed her by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now dissolved News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard and they didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid for place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat borshch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shooting at them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world hasn't gotten any better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now continuing, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the sofa, turned his face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw hell around me, with body parts all over.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so, unlike many others, life goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-thirsty face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she hurried to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days keep following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Urgent: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanting to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden in the bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are nothing at all with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget about it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
Later in 2004, I went back to school and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1 comes closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical college in Wladikawkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgy Faniev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gymnasium and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and do not ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I've been there two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I'll go to the commemoration celebrations.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept this when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He's been operated on several times, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and they were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for the slain.
I know of families where new children were born, but also widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I almost can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out as far away as we can.
Aliona Tskaeva, 10
The baby so poignantly carried to safety by a Special Operations Command
Saved: Aliona Tskaeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Alyona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty held back her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has been remarried since then and has with his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, ten years old today, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of driving girls over to pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the crossing in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a watertight point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the subdued underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
In our shopping guide and reviews, search for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So take a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse as you move away from the surface.
If possible, you will stay close to the surface if you take photos in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is even more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
It is especially important when you are working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill in the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consulting anaesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors were concerned with the diagnosis and diseases, while the patients were mostly concerned with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I've had trouble catching up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently accusing his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and without reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to take an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the pectoral membrane, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been former smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material, which was once considered a "miracle" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed itself not to using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the cloth plumber, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the culmination of a mesoltheliom epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no shelter.
The Parliament buildings are asbestos-infested.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this lethal carcinogen has already been identified as the source.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was trained for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been ill with mesothelioma for the past five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many more of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomers die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are going to get sick?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to come to a halt, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim to.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the parties often turn for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had been negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still regarded by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment or in the home."
According to him, a large part of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unknowingly exposed to the material.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be swirled up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
While the directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work has to be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than at the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to determine the exact contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
According to Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've worked on, and the data.
What he remembers is the day in early December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he did surgery just late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was caused by the chest skin, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Astonished doctors took X-rays of his chest and put in pleura catheters to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cave between the rib and the chest skin.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I wasn't so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of which recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who changed from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been lifesaving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Pupils put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry lessons, students have put their buns burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And meanwhile, such innocent objects in our houses as floorboards or shed roofs have, by default, contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch how you tear down your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it.""
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it's invasive right from the start.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some think it's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest skin," he says.
They don't get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still struggles.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counselling office for fellow workers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he said happily when he called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and would probably only prolong his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be remitted, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail, many sufferers are of another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "full compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers who seek compensation, it is an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact to a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance records may be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there have been significant new legislation this year, which makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a £350 million insurance industry-funded fund for all who were diagnosed after July 2012 to prove contact, but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have granted them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal from insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn't gone by and mesothelioma patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Also Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven fatalities, rapid action was necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expects to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"Of course, that's the most important thing," says Abbott.
You see that again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer patches around my chest.
I just turned 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's life ending.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that wouldn't make me old.
They reacted differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomers, such conversations are not pervaded by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (like Stephen Jay Gould in the end) brings a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to vote in government, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the growing calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action probably fuels the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking-faithful candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing had promised.
The people of Hong Kong were lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations to the Hong Kong government elections would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have the residents elected to the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong's citizens have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership remains firmly in control of the process through a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" should be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular protests have taken place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's government headquarters within a few hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online message, the organisers stated that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should take place only when all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were tightened on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The arrival of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, there is growing fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, as it endangers business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to stir up fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen shows are offered by private aircraft.
We look forward to responding to this demand and to offering Britain's first luxury travel service for students today.
In order to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with minimum effort and maximum luxury this year.
A company spokesman said that there are no new bookings yet, as the service has only just been introduced, but added that "students will book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as being withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis of cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the rapidly rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the student dorm.
Feminists criticise racial and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. earlier this month.
The participants lifted their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, about the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Midwest increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that white women's responses were 100% about the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9th, the personal essays entitled "Thoughts about Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who talk about being white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis that we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson exposed problems that black American women are exposed to every day, but which are not considered "women's issues" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the US, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattry, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hatery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hatery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white women fighters for women's suffrage like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for the suffrage could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to campaign for women's suffrage, and blacks' s suffrage should come later," said Hatery.
When you remember such things, you realize with power why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given voting rights in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize themselves against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catch" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" Mitchell asked.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after Michael Brown was shot on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race that are significantly different in public polls - will lead to change," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the racial theme in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson contrast with her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilises women for immigration reform, said that for a revisit of the topic as an essential theme for women, she only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.
Pig house in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had laid his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was mistakenly published and has now been removed," said a spokesperson for the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sale provided interest in the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW town of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newsstand in Harvey drew the jackpot in the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said the profit for talking stuff in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city doesn't talk about anything else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought that such a gain might occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due completion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had won the $7.5 million mega win just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said the winning allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators stood knee-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful dance of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat force from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust fighting skills in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men one after the other into the ring for a heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with a rectangular shield and shortsword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and throw lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection followed.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who fought against the "Secutor" with litter net, Dreizack and dagger and after a short fight hit the boy to the ground.
Then the swords crept metallically against each other, the shields scraped and the throwing lances flew surreptitiously through the arena that could be a fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an always attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," said Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friends of the Roman Canal", explaining the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired during Roman Day, such as "Aqueduct marble" from the eleven-meter-high and 1400-meter-long Roman canal bridge, which was once at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society faced the supply of water and energy once and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "Today we still benefit from the knowledge of the past".
This is also confirmed by the graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the steps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Conservation of Land Monuments at the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
They had found the surrounding walls of an economic building with a dart for drying grain and malting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a series of finds from these excavations in a glass cabinet, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germanic people in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In addition, the children dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal grips on wax tablets, as they once did.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and serve a heavy stone wheat mill at the stand of the Naturzentrum Eifel Nettersheim to grind the flour for a flat bread or a cereal.
With the Roman touring car drawn by two cold-blooded people, the visitors drove through the amusement park and passed the impressive stand of the Städtisches Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Römer project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014, proclaimed throughout the Rhine, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat- und Geschichtsvereinen as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the partnership association and the amateur play district Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell of his work on the hilly Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and present a funny lesson on the understanding of nations between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme within the framework of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made tangible again.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkum Matron shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are moving away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to West Africa's economy.
The crop rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has caused serious damage to the region.
Some international companies are already taking a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola will be on the market.
Liberia is hardest hit by the virus, and here alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
The health authorities recently stated that the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
A total of more than 1500 people died, and thousands more were infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies are suspending their operations throughout the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also react: Few merchants still leave their homes to get supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot in the fields.
The farmers dare not leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore feels the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food shortages.
In the markets, stocks of staple foods such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
According to Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris, the biggest danger is that international companies should basically avoid the area for a long time.
It was crucial to see how far and how long the virus would continue to spread.
Investors may feel that "it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia," warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by the high expenditure on the health care system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta is not yet affected.
But elsewhere, many people already stay at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels also go down significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The preparations for the 50-year foundation festival from 12 to 14 September run at the Schützenverein Tannenwald at full speed.
On Friday, September 12th, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, there's the big gunshot at 6:00.
Afterwards the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" is in the big marquee.
brass band provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the celebration service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big parade at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of federal and Gaushooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndln.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker took over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association for "social entertainment by means of practice in room and small caliber shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on 30 April at the Gasthaus Lukas raised the "new" shooting association "Tannenwald" Berngau.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as shooter champions through a difficult initial period, in which it was primarily about finding a club club and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the restaurant "Leininger" with two teams in the lap competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records pelted every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the membership numbers have also developed positively.
After the club club "Leininger" no longer met the demands of a modern shooting club, the then board under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härtis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, Father Strasser gave the church blessing for the new trenches.
One of the great highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th Gauschießen, combined with the ceremonial consecration of the new Sagittarius flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böller group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the organisation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, the members of the association modernised the rooms and the shooting area in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in lap competitions
The sporting achievements of the Schützenverein can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams currently participate in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, an air pistol team, a sports pistol KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann joined the district league 1 in the round 2013/14 from the Gauoberliga (highest league in Schützengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has climbed from Gauliga Nord into the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as jockeys, carnival and king's ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and parish.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst in lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now focused on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart had already driven into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in an ash race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a spot in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident leading to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart has to reckon with an indictment.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already entered the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a reboot in lap 122, Buschs
Car with No. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and colliding with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart drove on, but fell back to 21st place.
Dance-joyed offspring wanted
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to joining.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in the TV Jahn also have to create full-day lessons at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays some groups have decimated strongly.
Now it is increasingly looking for offspring for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to fifteen-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can sniff into the training session on Thursdays between 17 and 18 o'clock or on Fridays between 17 and 18.30 o'clock in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
"The training regularly starts with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements of folklore, classical music, sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance films and we have already stayed in the dance room," Lisa Neitzel reports.
In the group one can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and still do a lot for one's own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dance, you can also sniff into one of the other TV Jahn offers.
Children and teenagers can always enjoy lessons in children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop on Wednesdays.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who feel like discofox, slow waltzes, Viennese waltzes, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango can stop by and join in.
Bulgarian jailers protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with Interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been symbolically protesting for a month against the new working hours and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR).
The negotiations continue, the Director General for the implementation of sanctions told the BNR, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The protest of the prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the union association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine the pro-Russian fighters are on the rise.
After heavy battles, which allegedly also involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn human consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists fired aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists shot down another fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
In addition, some 100 soldiers were injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, according to Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian coast guard for the first time in the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been bombed on Sunday near the port of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, said a spokesman in Kiev, 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
Today the Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an ambassador of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In the run-up, all actors used their appearances to publicise their demands.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the 1997 founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO boss, however, accused Russia of "a gross breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and statements from the Russian side it emerges that "they regard us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union to send a representative to the talks was still awaited.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe receives about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks the power word: Toll will be "completely clear"
Now the chancellor has once again made a clear commitment to this.
But it's not a license for all the complicated details.
The CSU has been increasingly angry with persistent concerns from the CDU against the passenger car toll.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after continuing resistance from her CDU, has spoken in power for the introduction of a passenger car toll.
"To be quite clear, it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin.
But Merkel did not decide on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal, and this is now being worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll equal on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also contributed constructively to the discussions on a draft law.
He also talked to Dobrindt about further opportunities to mobilise more private capital for investments in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house checks his own concept to compensate motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to tow all the county and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country chairman.
In this respect, it was an important signal that Seehofer had now announced that he would talk again about the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverband Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background concerns are that tolls affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition support because of the toll criticism from the CDU.
The left sees the plans as failing in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The Minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners must not be additionally burdened.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the vehicle tax.
However, according to EU law, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years, that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure gait and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she was in a wheelchair before she was 18 and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never ride roller skate or skateboard with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair when I was 18 and I'd die when I was 25, and in between I'd slowly lose all my abilities.
I did all this alone with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17, she realized that her skills had not decreased as much as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworks worker since the closure of the former troop training area
For almost ten years, the former military training ground in Münsingen has not been used.
Still, killing ammunition appears every month at the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere region.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the ground.
A deafening bang echoes over the heart of the biosphere area during the blasts.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated paths.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District area, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.7 billion to government and local authorities in the 2013 financial year, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to revenues of $26.6 billion in 2012.
The company's state and local tax burden increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of falling decisions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia generates the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the property values of companies, the researchers say, resulting in an increase in property taxes of 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be also true for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not so effective in increasing state and local tax revenues in Maryland, as here real estate taxes amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following happens: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes to government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not rise evenly in all three places.
The increase in the district was 4.3 percent in line with the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates) with 6 percent in all three official areas.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and that overall there is a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, so they pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general revenue for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's spending cuts had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes for a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Li Yiwei, vice-party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Time and again, during the conversation, the functionary of the ruling Chinese Communist Party returned to this concern of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, was promoted by Li.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would look around for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer, it doesn't take much: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiated Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the functionary from Guangzhou started with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party leader Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but was canceled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to increase."
At the moment, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The Guangdong Province administration, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for a flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese vice minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-kept partnership
The beatified vice-party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office for corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is harshly enforced by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top functionary in Fujian, where VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen town partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese Association was celebrated.
The South China metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as all of Hesse.
Next year, it aims to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "tweaks the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has now shown hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a message.
We all keep our fingers crossed.
According to sources, her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest in a hospital on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are on the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September, on which the buyer will be able to recognise central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars there are sharper nitrogen oxide values in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for scaffolders: they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravo pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," says an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-knowers give the (mostly older) games a painting of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company buying a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon did.
All we know about this right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to play sports rather than watch, it's hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play, rather than taking control console into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. while she's sneaking through Resident Evil, and something completely different, watching a freak shoot him in the head 20 times in Call of Duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching can be a really good recipe for headaches without your own control over the perspective.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there isn't a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch is called up by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could easily have swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men who are advertised as advertisers.
As Twitch's chairman, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch both "believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallowing - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt fronds l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sahraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already apparent on the early Saturday, when the first visitors opened up to open air.
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese it had made itself Salzwedeler, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, whipped their feet in a beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.
And across the generations.
While some fell on blankets on the extra-carryed white sand at the beach bar, others fell on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when making make-up for children, the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word, in order to become master of the urge and to conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew made of saltwedel arranged.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he poked down on the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success in the whole line."
Therefore, there is nothing to prevent a repetition of the big party next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made clear to the people's voice in a first report on Sunday.
He said that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company had been booked with too little power.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the grounds anymore.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who strolled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox therefore broke off their appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tyre breakdown.
"They will be there next year," the organiser said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but will have to be eliminated in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook the organizers have to take criticism.
"Sorry, but you just expected more for twelve euros," says Melanie Meier on the event side.
"Unfortunately, you took over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as so narrow.
I think it's very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hats off!" writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
Now the organisers have one year to put these criticisms aside.
New radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready lying component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar TIRA, the hull, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom with a diameter of 47.5 meters will be slightly smaller than the old one.
But the size remains world record.
The last step to complete the new case is to replace the cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
If the weather plays along, the action should take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket Challenge dislocateds her jaw
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she screamed so hard at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing the deed, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was tangled, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw it, and laughed at each other, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to the hospital to allow the jaw to be receded after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs going to pull together again soon?
Finally, there was always a conflict between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the board members are thinking about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
The views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be quite different so far.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
The board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit together once," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all the members of both associations could in the future be drawn together again.
He said that there were more visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until the last time a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in mind, the "development and experience" of the site stands for the castle association around Sjöberg at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very happy about the call according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially let the club activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then enter into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood within their group.
There is not yet a candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman was supposed to be a wolf councilman.
The Tölzer wants to continue to work on the project "but very much likes to work on it".
Piffl's view is that the different points of view regarding reconstruction will remain in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
By a high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I, too, was skeptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time, I became more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project." An "all-enhancing feature" could be created for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally don't want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may be moving a bit on this point.
Their goal, to document the story first, "is important and good".
That's what you could look forward to.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever spar idea.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale of the books.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a-kek," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that on average, students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are different cost reduction options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
The rent of textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college bookstores last spring semester, said Neebo's Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookshops, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-time deal for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $ 290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
Calculus is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if previous issues were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditures can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rents
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don't want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business where you are renting, including the penalties that may apply to the writing of notes, underlinings or traces of use.
Tenants pay attention: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best offers in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'm sure you'll look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, one should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone accounted for less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" earned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape", tailored to Cameron Diaz, only received $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Drachenzämmen leicht macht 2" also disappoint with their revenues.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason for the children's films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Drachenzämmen leicht gemacht 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer release, which was shown on at least 2000 screens between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to last year's.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney's soon-to-be-release jungle book film, told Hollywood Reporter to the website, "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated revenue of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million in revenue.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comic films and for prophesied a "melting of the core" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cashier hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about business anymore."
When the 2nd table tennis district class was cancelled a few years ago to streamline the league division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the program.
The result: whoever has not ascended has descended.
For example, Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided the descent, but plays only fifth-class in the coming season.
Torpedo's ladies remain fourth-rate, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo reserve compete in the new league, in the Landesliga no more Göttinger clubs are represented.
==References====External links==*Official website*Official website
What looks like a better district class is now the new District Oberliga South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC compete here.
In the district league the regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende play, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district upper league of the ladies starts at least in nominal strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game here.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the SCW-boys' district league relay - Torpedo II still starts there - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the western relay are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Eastern relay, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The women's league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no women's teams at all at the county level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieves target strength, here the innovative and busy district board will have to think about.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so - called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us this weekend and talking to demonstrators who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO young bushwalkers were brought to safety with the winch after they were caught the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man left for their tour in Govett's Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday noon.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when they had not returned home.
A search group of local police and rescue services left and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had hurt her knee and the man had fallen and had his head open.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were sent to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition with an ambulance.
escalate anti-government protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators were forced out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After about half an hour, the station re-recorded the broadcast.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the sticks-equipped demonstrators had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators demand the resignation of the head of government, to whom they accuse election fraud.
The police said that about a kilometre from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there were again clashes with security forces on Monday by some 3,000 demonstrators.
According to hospital records, a policeman was injured.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to reach Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the Army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict to "waste without time and use without violence".
The communication further stated: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has stirred up concern about military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed similar views.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and announce new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially peacefully endured in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif's residence this weekend.
Hütteldorfer finished third in the table after a second win in the season.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has come to a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the out in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and goaltender Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green and white.
Schrammel Traumtor brings Rapid to the winner's road Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes into the international game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent leadership volley from the Sixteenth corner.
"I thought I'd hit all the frustration of Thursday and put it under the bar," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on November 13, 2010, this was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, that's something very special, I'm from the Rapid junior," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pool-blessing, Schrammel moved from the left to the right side of the defensive and did his thing very well there too.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position mirrored.
He has earned the goal, he has already done some assists this year," said Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2-0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written down.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," remarked Schrammel, referring to the gap between performance and result over the past few weeks: "The results have not been right, but the playfulness has always been good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that one had been "better in many games than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since 26 July therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him it's no less gratifying: "That we finally played to zero again".
A lot of work during the international break The fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures are to be lamented, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts makes the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," said Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable recently."
The inter-country break must therefore be used to "leak wounds and increase them a bit in the physical field," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
Captain Hofmann is one to whom the break seems to be particularly convenient.
He's tearing himself up for the team, going over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids the structure, but also scored the second goal in the 68th minute before his change.
For the 33-year-old, who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Mayn't believe that everything is good now" "We've certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point luck has to come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He warned, of course, about concentrated further work: "You must not always see this in black and white.
We haven't played as badly in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help a lot right now.
They still stick to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team for.
He regretted the quick counterpoint "out of the category Magic Gate", as well as the regular gate of profit in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly denied by referee collegiate.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We didn't have enough qualifications.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner looked like this: "It started very badly, but then we found pure and even made a goal.
By and large, there would have been more.
Under this top, there's rest
We showed a powerful tribe in our mystery task of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It goes past Koppeln, Basaltsteinstäfte and Basaltsteinmeeren.
A bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds of an American mammoth tree with a circumference of more than eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intensive research, however, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider especially consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what their relationship with the Geißruheiche is.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the toiled meadows freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree the animal guardians exhausted from the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, herds of goats are actually grazing again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for cruciform otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are signposted, which climb up to Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where's the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought in our next task, is rather rare in height.
The reflection in the ditch gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where is our piece of Rhöner Glück located?

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy's Prime Minister and current EU Chairman, Matteo Renzi, won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy last week against strong conservative resistance at the EU's special summit, she succeeds Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica reflects, considers the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to put the left-wing party base, which is constantly protesting against him, in a calm way, because Mogherini is associated with it - albeit more moderately.
The conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President of the Council, Donald Tusk, said that the prevailing opinion in Rome would make a political balance.
The EU's Chief Diplomat will be the deputy of Commission President Juncker at the same time.
The remaining agreement of the EU Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, which has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and is known for its ambition, will be able to cope with the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her political career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged in 2008 with the Catholic centre party Margherita to form today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she joined the high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO's deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, used contacts with the social democrats in Europe and with the democrats in the USA.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as Minister of Foreign Affairs.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's over 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini, as noted in PD circles, has a share in it.
The accusations in Brussels that the new EU High Representative had too little diplomatic experience, so if it lacks substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherinis' suspiciously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian gas is to be transported directly to Southern Europe by bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy's energy.
Following Renzi's appointment as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with indignation, as well as inviting the Kremlin leader to a Milan Economic Summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training occupations: electronics technicians (three trainees), mechatronics technicians (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All apprentices come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Büchel from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited Haupt- or Mittelschulen and Realschulen.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all ages as well as the trainers will go to a team-building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the agenda.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet conversion has been met with disapproval by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a appeasing gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong demands for a relaxation of Emmanuel Macron's regime, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, threw sand into the drive in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the Socialists' constant trench struggles and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the fall or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament and said that she was confident that she would be the victor in early elections and that she was ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Holland's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise provider, leads, according to industry experts, advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as to its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names of Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around $29 billion and is expected to grow in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities for the IPO in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise, in its current form in 2000, was formed by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino conglomerate under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
According to regulatory authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together have 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking faithful group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates to vote for leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with peking-faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to uphold their threat and paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's leadership fears that calls for democracy will expand to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which presented China's predominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched to the city's business district and organised a sit-in.
Li's interview is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
Mr. Zhang Rongshun, Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, and Mr. Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macaus Office of the State Council, were to be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of the leadership office in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain did not foresee any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to open "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status with Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he seems to have pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: helping separatists to take over territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossija region to effectively independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the occupied territory "Novorossija" or "Neurussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary splendor of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the separatist areas, are hoping for early peace talks "captured in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We must immediately engage in detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman on the correction of Putin's "misinterpretation" underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period resulted in a large majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area connecting the Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his speech at the inauguration on 7 June, proposed that Ukraine's legislation, after new elections, should consider additions to the Constitution to give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed after a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took control of Novoazovsk in the handshake, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to secure Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoazovsk and narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to a point where there is no turning back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn't hide his anger about hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who's who of the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the Internet.
The responsible hacker probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "The Tribute of Panem" and superstars, among them the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne reportedly also published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Noblest, who had been engaged to Grecko last month, said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "harmful" and that the people affected felt "harmed."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, among them two shots in which she lies upstairs without in a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Liebe ist invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence told TMZ, "It's a heinous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing else than selling hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were present yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Große Feldberg and supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was an ordeal for some, was an easy training for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewhouse drove yesterday by bike to the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the little muscle ache, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Große Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for children with cancer" (Frankfurt) also brought him a valuable insight personally.
That's a great thing.
"I know I can do that now - great!"
Little chat on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits in the Oberursel City Parliament for the CDU, many of the 718 participants tortured themselves yesterday in the early thaw and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the well - eleven - kilometre - long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - made a little bit of understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!"), but then turned out to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without breathlessness.
He, too, went through the track in one slide, as well as Nina Kuhn, press officer of the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we would like to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to walk up the hill again.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 a.m. at home, "making" the Feldberg twice, and then rolling home with fun.
It was fun, too, "Friten-Toni."
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply included.
He had targeted 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilo racing bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is a "ambitious racing cyclist".
That's what he has to be, because he was on the road with the "Fixie bike", which are also racing bikes, but without circuit...
Not only did the 20 hikers, who climbed over the White Wall and the Fox Dance to the summit, prove that it was easy to climb up without a bike, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights on a cord.
Bergwacht-doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team, equipped with four-wheel-bully and quad, said: "I know that" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself." So the man is his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The walkers first at 9:30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the starting squads and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that he will be able to block the route to Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
