28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother testified that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "Finally, he went uphill again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, reported the San Francisco Department of Forensic Medicine.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and that the investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had earned his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughter said that they were "shocked and devastated" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unground diamond that glowed brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's warning phone under the number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or I get label glued on from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself don't want to be perfect and successful."
"Truly, these things are more of a snare to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the television with a loose dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
To the white glow she raises the question of the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play", Aniston can be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be on our website from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a little change with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening off, they chased home to the feeding troughs in a fast gallop.
One kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back near horses.
He and his family were led by the ALRV, and he didn't even swung on a horse for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sporthilfe presented the Golden Sport Pyramid to the man from Anhausen during a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete does not lack awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already rebuked him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting successes, but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been supporting the young.
And so he passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was accepted into the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the award winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencing men Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sporting legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates are divided on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, however, would be quite different, Trump claims.
He said he would massively reduce regulations, and he was in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged people and that it needs money.
That's why the taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say they have to invest in them almost immediately.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are traditional democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republicans' state-critical Teaparty wing.
So Trump could still be discussed within the party.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and to revitalize coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, with her investment program, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
They should then be paid better, for example, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says that it must not be changed.
But the big discussion over the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics suggest that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone's got a baby who's only one year old.
One put her little son in his arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother is staring at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
In the north of Munich, they live in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
Recently, it was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men don't exist - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard outside the door.
"It's not an exaggeration to say that every woman who comes here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are being politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls," she says.
In women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many steal themselves secretly from it because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them away.
On the run, that goes on.
"The fact that tugs, for example, demand a sexual action for a bottle of water is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that as soon as they arrive in Germany, the end is crazy, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused at worst.
This means that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not emerged voluntarily".
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about what they have experienced, because the shame is too great."
Since they often didn't know how to help themselves, they only need more shelter for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of competence, some respond with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government shelters.
Even in Swabia, refugees alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Middle Franconia there are floors or own houses in some communal accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If there is privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can occur - on an ongoing basis".
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, says the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be seen at the rush there is to the house in Munich.
"We've had a long waiting list ever since we got word that we've been around," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Interns strike: demands for new industrial action
Deputy interns have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to respond to concerns about the treaty.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently calm" to problems, resulting in the contract being rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that will begin in early September.
The disputes led to interns striking six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA interns Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 interns and medical students, that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be forcibly introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow-lipped and he radiated little warmth, even for his reserved circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.
But Putin's emanating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launch of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was frantic.
Putin disbanded and accused Ankara of falling back on Russia.
The offense was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unreserved attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after having been almost removed from office last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there, tomatoes this way."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the ongoing resentment about the snail-pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup d'état.
This is, of course, a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime changes.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described to me, an "Alliance of Outsiders": two countries that are rejected by the West and feel badly treated and now allied.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even striped the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, the RBS brand will only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail banking business that will get more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and employees in Inverness-shire during a sightseeing tour.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you'll see many changes.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Prediction
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Prediction, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the cheer when he gets the victory on Prediction
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has been enthusiastic about this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already ridden almost 30 years of winners in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was annoying.
A number of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive strength in character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue at competitions until his 50th birthday.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
According to a statement by the Kremlin, Putin "has ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons."
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website (in Russian) it says that he was later Chief of Protocol and Chief of Staff of the government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that it is the government's most important task to support your work as Head of State with regard to draft laws and controls on the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Putin's closest confidants and works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff would resign at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few people here are convinced of it - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once hailed as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy - came up with great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - arduous post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term would have violated Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation on the series set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced their termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heartblood into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a message published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can wish for a show.
The scheduled broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
Puzzles about fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandeels that were spied out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower", which are approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slanting ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards on a slope of about 3%.
Heikel, because the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelbre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be alive"
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded an alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety, while their boat moved on from their own strength.
"We saw the boat turn around near them and imagined the worst," said Moelbre Vince Jones, head of the rescue station.
"Luckily, the strong winds blew the boat out of reach until we let it go," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was exhausted and found hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it detached from the person controlling the boat when the boat was capsized.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Severely injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by his hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man's ex-life partner.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be placed in a much stronger position in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "handling concept of housing" for the next Council meeting.
But argument is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you will have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
The cheap apartments can, however, also arise in the stock.
According to Bratmann, however, the big issue in the town hall is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent of housing on such areas, but as much as possible 20 percent of housing as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and will still have to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The left still wants tough requirements for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation on the housing market was worsening.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments, which will be phased out in the coming years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to Nicole Palm, who is responsible for planning policy, the city should now acquire out-of-date bonds.
In addition, consideration should be given to getting homes back into price fixing.
This is possible in the West City.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
Because deadlines expire in the West City at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back there into the price fixation for cheap apartments.
But the owners, the housing companies, don't want that.
Because if the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased again, one is removed from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should be no concentration of socially weak people in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU has to go on board."
She had concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.
But this does not mean that a compromise cannot be found after all.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go delusion, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of launch of the game, the number of tracked people training 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for the increase in performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that try to get people to "take 30 minutes to get" "from the sofa" and "to be active every day" came to deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run into a door.
What the hell?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will slow down over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumphorse.
Effortless on the beam.
Stunning on the ground.
Brilliant all the way.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalist and final five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The American woman Simone Biles turns on the suspended beam during the women's individual multi-fighting final at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-combat title and the fifth overall, as she strengthens her reputation of being the best of her generation or even ever.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn't go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women's individual multi-fighting final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long journey to the top, that is not really true.
Part of her ground exercises - which contain her typical tumbling pass - are adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more multi-fighting competition, a victory series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture was deceptive.
Floating beams and ground gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world champion title - lurked.
She caught up again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and put one on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her endergnis - a pure formality - and tears streamed onto Bile's shiny red, white and blue eyeliners when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in a serial killer's case listening to music in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of Phoenix's most deadly attacks in a decade in the first serial killer case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Malah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the front passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman for Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting induced the investigators to get a closer look at whether she was connected to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were injured, mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Malah died on the spot.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and which is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved with that.
What's not true at all -- of course they got involved in it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund might never recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that he be institutionalized.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know people were still doing that'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still can't speak.
But he's progressing slowly.
He can walk with support and ride a bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund designed for "Please sing something for me"."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to announce the emergency on Friday. More rains are expected all Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfall, reports the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards stated that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that requests for flood craft, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa community alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabamas, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams still plucked people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high point of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers saved all three in a large military truck and took them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "expanded rapidly" as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation orders.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been heavily soaked by the rains since Wednesday.
The authorities stated that heavy rains and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and a failure to teach in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which were now both flooded.
The head of the community Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets washed up by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water begins to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the floods and sandbags were provided for the residents to take along, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported yet on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "perforated by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police say that the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week for the second time that a six-year-old child was shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents said Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious of his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy's family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He should have started his first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrator.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge shells for assault rifles, which were traced back to various assault rifles, oversaw the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were pods.
There seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reporting on the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old girl was hit by a ricochet on her arm when she played in front of her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm imagining under the women's olympia team in gymnastics for more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, yet masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not how gym classes look like all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics is primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymns and families). The list can be continued as desired.
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must allow the communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and accessible gymnastic training.
I started my 20-year-old gymnasium.
At my events we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics, and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Interns want to organize further strikes after they've rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 interns who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract forcibly and said that the NHS was in a "no-one's country" and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first interns are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Interns last night, said in a statement: "Assistents continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with reluctance to participate in the government and sometimes with deafening silence.
This happened to a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the force and address the concerns of the interns."
If he does not do so, the interns have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide cover for doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the Reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly wage for the 54,000 interns who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, general manager of the NHS staff, asked the interns to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work-fighting measures do not achieve anything of little, but burden already overburdened teams and service providers and only cause the patients, nurses and their families worry, need and interruption."
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of interns and have responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues, such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training desks, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine, were a sign of the seriousness of employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of myocardial infarction patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities have recommended that this more people be given for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medication is given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or further heart attack.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls forming coverings.
When the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
NICE's draft guide, published today, recommends a 12-month dose of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend any treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Makes Electoral Fraud Blossom in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the initiative of a government report on corruption
A political correctness culture has led to widespread electoral fraud being knowingly ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an antcorruption king, said that the intimidation of religious voters would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of election booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an ID card to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person's finger when they vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He called for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the current mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with Rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent postal election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including holding ID cards to prove the identity
His report states: "To prove that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists working on postal ballot papers to stop "whales."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before the election for your ID.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once she has cast her vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limitation on requests for an automatic postal ballot.
Prohibition for political activists to deal with full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
Give the police authority to set up perimeters for polling stations.
An amendment to the law to facilitate intimidation charges under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photography ban in polling stations.
Require that only English may be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the election booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "remarkable" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal charges were filed.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He became guilty for a number of reasons for being sufficiently known, in accordance with the high requirements of the criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhak controls" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court verdict in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's Doppelganger and other famous doppelganger of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio got out of hand this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold, who has his own famous doppelganger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of olympies that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood fame.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's doppelganger on the cycle track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A- celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures showing up in an uncanny fashion with the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus this year: the resemblance between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to pass through as a doppelganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A walk higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to be like an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's similarity
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner at Gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian channel CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and died like a pig during the race.
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board to the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57.79–1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to bridge the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweet, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China died "like a pig?"???
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for the comment from MacDonald and said, "We apologize for the comment about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized over 90 times to the people who responded to the notice via Twitter
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about the comments from MacDonald
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to our followers on the social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention that it would be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim team in the CBC Olympic show, he said.
"I have referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark outraged at woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she checked what she looked like in it, undressed it and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tasted four pairs of underpants in a shop at Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried on her underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own pantyhose and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took off the underpants, which obviously did not please her, because she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn't like it, put on her clothes again and went out.
"She didn't seem to mind that someone was watching her - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take a pair of underpants home that were wearing another person and that were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I noticed, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and undressing them again and that they were not washed."
A spokesman for Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Weapons Attacks with Krav Maga
The outside world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your robber.
If you are approached from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with his knee in the groin and twist as the assailant bends in pain, the weapon from his hands. Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it, so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the gun and hit the attacker's chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before they move backwards and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, it's safest to hand over your money in a robbery unless you're a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller subjected his immune system and strangulation reflex to a serious test by licking some of Europe's most dirty and disgusting places.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his train on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get involved with.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the flush button of a draw toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to flush buttons of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a test
In the film, he said, "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.
Mr Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film, he says, "That's close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say it like that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasional products containing lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogging social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a delogging with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in irreparable condition.
The walls showed gaping holes, wooden boards were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.
The family were relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for Cornwall Housing's house management, said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had caused the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn open
Neighbors testified that they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly moved her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The delogging was hailed by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added, "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, as delogging is always the final step that Cornwall Housing takes.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horribly watched by their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will comfort some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogging on the floor
House management workers will now have to clear away garbage mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she found guilty of possession of a class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's walls were smeared with graffiti.
The police say she's gonna delog tenants who don't follow the house rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police reported that the delogging was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not follow the house rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-defence, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a low-flying military jet overflys beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A portugisiese P-3C Orion aircraft of the air force put an incredible fall
Air forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists start panicking after a deep-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach over the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The vacationers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew by twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on Aveiro's beach were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese air force reported today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so low that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility due to nearby fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time compromised.
Land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, in which four people were killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force reported today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restricted his visibility.
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the duel for the Spanish Supercup against Sevilla FC, the rematch increases three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner has to give up Neymar with the inferior Cup finalist and reigning European League champion among others, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament dip in the knee during the training, thus clarifying the question of Barca's one in favor of Claudio Bravo at least for the time being.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique gave up a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most of the other competitions.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness status of the team, who was humiliated in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4 on Saturday.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince at the 3:2 in the trial gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, in turn, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his fellow countryman and "defendant" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world ranking first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and Olympic Games.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final match as expected and made up the title among themselves.
So it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, and they didn't have any coaches with them between the sentences and time-outs.
They had withdrawn to the grandstand and let their protégés loose on their own in a fair competition.
"I've played the matches to this point for my country."
"I'm playing for myself in the final," Zhang said logically.
After the match, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he set the pace on the record and left Zhang only 13 points in total.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, enough breathtaking ball changes were to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had contracted a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" content himself with sheet metal.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had, by the way, become Olympic fourth in a similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits "violent problems" in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually large and confident multimillionaire expressed some kind of concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said to evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida, and Virginia.
Blame was false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media censorship.
The Republican strongholds are shaking
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey conducted by SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same level.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not by the distance that Republican candidates in the state are used to.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview by CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just as I have done so far."
And pushed behind: This will either be "successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If, in the end, it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump is said to have threatened to cancel funds to support his campaign if he is unable to present better polls.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans were to be given greater support for the Congress.
Olympia: Dreizet fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes face trouble after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team leadership by the doping controllers.
The World Federation of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to carry out its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman informed.
"Depending on the findings of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," declared Kenya's head of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters.
Four days earlier, Kenya's head of athletics, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offenses.
In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls launched by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out before that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.
Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics.
Subsequently, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping is in accordance with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a large runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of TV reports by the ARD, there have been repeated accusations that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and that there is a considerable mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been shown that this sport was widely and systematically doped.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the West Side Story with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with melancholy her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there's Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"It is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman woman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of your movements, in your eyes, it's your life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl, who joined ISIS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she intended to leave the war-stricken country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since Barack Obama's nomination in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokesman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge for the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, were lackeys and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was not suitable for the presidency.
Treats wants naked calendar for "women and men"
Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine was different from old school playboys, because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does.
"We need to return to the representation of timeless and classic nutritiousness, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally on an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Those who don't adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-Nähigen Stiftung Dialog und Welt.
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany anticipates tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", the chairman of the association Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition," said Ali Toprak, chairman of the association of the "world" on Friday.
Because the government had already overturned Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey.
After the vanquished coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that receives refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
In this way Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or displaced over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters".
Also in Germany there is a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics.
For the first time in the last few months, I don't feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as Gülen followers destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who don't adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-Nähigen Stiftung Dialog und Bildung, the "World".
As reported by the newspaper on the basis of figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany who were recognised for political persecution even before the coup.
On June 30, this was 11,386 people, almost 29 percent of all recognized as eligible for asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who fled from war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Asylum seekers under the Basic Law are exclusively politically, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the Landtag elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because stupider than before it doesn't work: summer holidays, heat and state elections - that bites.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
Most holidaymakers who are in the country on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and ultimately count out voices are only hard to find.
By 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has yet to pass the election campaign by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say so at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his position.
The SPD, which has been the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
Exciting is how strong newcomer AfD cuts off and what is left in the end for the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise soul ring has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the blossoming of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "We manage this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the fine office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," lamented Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it's also not a pity not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.
That, Kokert says, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that it is breaking the ground in the country, that it has to make a great effort to find a link with the people again.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow fighters is also self-explanatory: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village parties, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to hold a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last behind partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap to the Landtag.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and transfer their campaign largely to the Internet.
"Online election campaign", it calls the state chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners go on a search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27-Renovation: Restaurants suffer from blocking
There's nothing to complain about in the speed with which the B27 is rehabilitated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at about 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty shaky," Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet filling station tells us.
This is a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south on schedule, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
The acceptance of those responsible for the construction work is also praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and the connection to Rottenburg also exists again, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
From Ofterdingen, citizens can now re-enter the B 27 on both sides.
The alternate traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Head of Main Office, responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise, because many Schleichwege were looking for and more familiar with their nav than the signposting.
As a result, some trucks frayed in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant exceedances," says King, who has been briefing himself about the situation on the spot.
Two to three per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest was at 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen on the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 remediation has led to a drop in their turnover allows anyone you ask to see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
If you have less to do with the "final customer", i.e. produce for other companies, the renovation has hardly any consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highly slight decline" at the Maier car dealership, but also admits that of course "the running clientele is missing".
The most crowded are the restaurants along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already existentially threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants "hit hard."
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro in sales.
He estimates the decline in sales to "over 50 percent".
The road renovation had "returned its operation by two years".
He had to dismiss half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them were dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, in response to a request from Göhner that there could be a financial compensation, President Jörg Schmidt replied by saying that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other counties where something like that was handled more generously.
With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars now visit less frequently because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clients will come back after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly being applied.
Following the recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Compromiser.
All of his proposals are "politically acceptable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm part of it too.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was interested in results and in a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière took a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But these are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: It is not new that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU standards on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière starts a second attempt for proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and cut off the German passport for jihadists with double citizenship.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that the coalition partner has no chances of doing anyway.
De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
Some of them have it in themselves: He is planning quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
When tolerated for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also seem unbalanced and leave questions unanswered.
And on some points, for example, in the unequal treatment of the patient, the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that deeply occupied the people could not be ignored even in campaign times.
Internal security has become an enormous focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, election campaigns are in place.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, the two parties have been very busy.
First a grim dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy collection of ideas of some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a Burka ban and a departure from double citizenship.
De Maizière also struggles here for conciliatory tones.
He doesn't think anything about turning away from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Reopening it is not sensible.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to be shown.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
However, the SPD is also trying to identify itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel cautiously signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen's still getting away with it.
Despite diesel scandals, deliveries worldwide are increasing.
However, it does not run round in all markets.
In the recall action, there is a whirlwind around a term.
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year more cautiously when it comes to deliveries.
Europe's largest car manufacturer, despite the diesel affair, continues to show an increase in the course of the year, thanks to its many brands and a number of well-run markets.
However, in July, the core VW brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles with 449100 cars worldwide than in the same month of the previous year.
Sales in Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, were 14 percent below the same month of the previous year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
Moreover, in some core markets, "changed economic conditions" have led to a degree of buy-in restraint.
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote on leaving the EU was also burdened, said one speaker.
In the USA, where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a minus.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony continues to be glamorous due to the diesel scandal anyway: after the first seven months, only a delivery reduction of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.
At this time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls for around 2.5 million cars to be converted into workshops.
In the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
There was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion of the vehicles.
The automaker issued a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but did not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called in company circles on Friday.
The reason is legal finesse.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for retrofitted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was a meeting.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigative commission and the KBA."
"Differences from this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to type approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the wide term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers will come to a workshop half a year after the conversion, for example, with an engine damage - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer's interest to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, as it was said, being insecure with regard to possible warranty arrangements.
Therefore VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand fines from rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on current or daily money accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: normal savers "should not fear to pay fines for their savings grumps".
If banks keep money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they will have to pay it 0.4 percent penalty interest.
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will reclaim this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than EUR 100,000 to current or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
For some time now, he has been guarding EUR 40 million, which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not use.
"They are on my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't lie down for every million euros."
The cost was now passed on according to the 'polluter pays' principle.
Just leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four raids, I don't want the fifth one!" said the bank board.
Most customers would understand and switch to other investment forms.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance causes considerable costs for all banks".
It is not possible to carry it alone in the long term.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land and its Skatbank branch in 2014 made headlines with penalty interest rates for deposits of three million euros or more.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay comprehensive fees for deposits, but competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong."
A banker said that at Lake Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is somewhat more luxuriantly equipped with wealth."
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if it keeps money for free.
The Gmund cooperative bank, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association "at present no other banks are known to charge a replacement fee for retail deposits," said spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Federation of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), said: "The threshold of going negative towards the private customer is very, very high."
The competition was tough and the outflow of investors threatened to compete.
The customers in Germany will not let this happen in the broadest possible way.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the commentary section to oversaw it under the pseudonym NichtAlleEinsamenMenMiddle-Age with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much spoken revival of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely group of buyers.
Nor is it a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and stomp wildly before I stand still, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "So let's take a closer look."
So let's take a look.
Even though the heart of Soho slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of dates: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of dates: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), undress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things that I was probably a little too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are true to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I've had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in followers of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took an incitement to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
That's what I do as a collector, and I think it's the case with a lot of people.
It is an easy way to engage in spiritual activity.
"We are like their social workers!" a member of staff flutes from a stack of records.
A April ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those buying a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I'd probably look very worried while I'm leafing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older people, who are only slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teens and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beast's newest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roars out of the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
None of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of the plates for sale.
She's more of a window shopper than a big shopper.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
As I appear to be patterning the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teen girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think of buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just purely decorative, some so far up that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure plate art.
But given that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record stores and leafing through records while avoiding the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who stands over the shoulders of no-one-in-a-kind men of middle age.
The Greenland shark is the longest live vertebrate - video report
Scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was in a female that is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer about demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should have the power to tear down 72 temporary shops where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which entail a fire and medical risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people engaged in the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the low-rise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run non-profit-making and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympian disappointment: Martin remains militant
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and keep fighting," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar cane.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to analyse in peace what reasons had led to the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Championships in Qatar in October.
"I'll take a close look at everything we've changed in recent times."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time World Timetrial Champion, who had lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday at the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis pro Wiegemund misses semifinals
Laura Siegemund's triumph ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to achieve her impact once and seemed powerless compared to the previous laps.
On Thursday, medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German professional tennis player to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of summer games had last been there in 1992.
Never before has a German duo stood in an Olympic single semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up beam, which specializes in this hobby.
On Thursday, Microsoft didn't tell us how much money is going on the takeover.
With his offer, Beam only started in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The game giant Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington, USA, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers by the takeover.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by online retailer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google's mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's speedometers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: new flash devices are being tested in various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, which are supposed to transfer speed detectors particularly effectively.
For example, the futuristic enforcement trailer from Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at accident priorities, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days during continuous measurement, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lanes and vehicle category can also be monitored.
In the elevated condition you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and by the way also bulletproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also being used.
Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain picks up silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, rearwarding, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day, could be attributed to them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Britishman will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had gone a difficult way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one thing they lost here.
This limp is going to hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and had GB's attacks bounce off out of fun.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and others as if you were walking in moving buses. World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau rushed over in the corner.
With four more minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner, which he changed.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
An outstanding tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua read a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-initiation and there was still over a minute of play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravoubou pushed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap...for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been running for a long time in favor of the South Sea Islands, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the grandstand.
It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-timple with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked in the lawn with a crushing punch.
Earlier that day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a narrow semi-final match out of the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the coach's cancer to win the rudder
There won't be any more emotinal gold than in these games, and that means something.
From the first oar strike to the last 220 hard blows that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was all-important when they rowed for the second Olympic gold in a row in a row without a taxwoman, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a standard.
Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39th undefeated bet, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the way of triumph in its entirety.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he would survive this day than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he's risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, it'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital walking around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking about it a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you goes to him.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the trial, stay in the trial."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't about to do something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
Ruppert Göller, managing director of the water-purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", retires.
The association is considered "Bavaria-wide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago the original sound was said in a contribution by the Bayerischer Rundfunk.
A little later, the Water Forum paid tribute to the government of Lower Franconia.
The work of the Veitenstein group was considered "Bavaria-wide as exemplary".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was a member of the Zweckverband for 31 years, 28 of whom are managing directors.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), pointed out that Rupert Göller was appointed as water waiter in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zweckverband as early as 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organisational activities, budgeting, charging fees and contributions to weekend emergency operations," said the chairman.
As outstanding events she mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the rehabilitation of the high tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There had been no stoppage and there had been constant innovations, because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and accurate service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association literally as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group on nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the District of Lower Franconia.
He had received a great deal of appreciation and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water keeper and he was a faithful squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view he described the well construction and the restructuring of the Zweckverband.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank near Kirchlauter on a 3rd January.
Here at minus 17 degrees it was necessary to work all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko deals openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, has made good progress and is now studying privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, when I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang about La Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he's the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship state in Bargtehiide - Man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) at 10.45 a.m. on Friday and killed her.
"The man himself called us and told us that he had shot his partner," said a police spokesman.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him is publicly punished.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about six feet tall, muscular, brown-burned and bald.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
In the meantime, the man is bald.
I don't want the man to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police speak of a "stat of relationship."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
At first, the police in Lübeck did not want to provide any information about the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but it confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a homicide."
"That's all we're saying right now," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity support are off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy levy remains with the existing plants for the so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers using gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry faces additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steelworks are replaced would an EEG levy of 20 percent apply.
But this is not the case in the steel industry either.
IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on own electricity generation.
This would largely stipulate the status quo of the existing regime.
The success of Gabriel's efforts in the steel industry was particularly important.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"Others must follow."
"Climate and employment targets are also to be weighed when it comes to reforming emissions trading," explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, Europe's steel industry has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation worsened further when China, the world's largest producer country, threw massive steel on the world market in the face of weak domestic demand.
European producers are accusing Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on imported steel have had an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Finally, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month of the previous year, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased for the second month in a row.
Production has been two percent below the previous year's figure since the beginning of the year.
Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in output in the coming months.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good for seniors
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, during her teaching studies she studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and, overall, more alive, she says.
Incidentally, she is doing something good for her health and her spirit.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also experienced this experience in her choir: "A choir is a very special form of being together, to be able to discuss and organize oneself, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of their breath so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singen often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often combined with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with a disease remember events that have long since passed away.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, Lenz explains.
Concentrating on one's own voice and a predetermined rhythm at the same time, adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there are enough.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in an ecclesial choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet search.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to cries of young animals
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen did not leave the males cold either - however, they always behaved the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the arousal of cat babies at the miaug of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who feel in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary College and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) have found out.
Cats also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the miowing of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not relevant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens are different with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH's livestock were observed.
They were presented with calls of little ones, who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who have not yet had their own offspring, reacted differentiatedly to the screams," said Konerding.
They turned to the loudspeaker faster when these calls of the very more excited kittens played off.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noises on several occasions in humans.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grabs Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football match takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt.
Before the duel of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempted overthrow in July, the government affirmed that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt.
It also does not stop at football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
Thus, the so-called "Sükür" now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, in fact this has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
Erdogan declared the nightly "democracy guards" on public squares throughout the country to be over on Wednesday.
Sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas workers' club are traditionally not among the president's friends.
But what unites the majority of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With cup winner "Gala" it will be especially again on Lukas Podolski.
The Cologneer proved his sporting value in the past season: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 win.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary knockout in the Champions League, the lions also retired early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only to rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
==References====External links==
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig goal scorer king.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
After the coup attempt, Gomez, who was under contract with the AC Florenz and loaned to Besiktas, had announced that he would not return after his trip to the European Union due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, all he has to do is say it," said the magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
However, the striker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at the Olympic Games in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletes can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The issue of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Juliya Yefimova, who had sued her right to start just before the games after a doping jump, was mercilessly whistled and booed at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a bizarre scene: with a smile on, she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her performance.
When it was clear that she was not going to get gold, the audience burst into a cheering storm.
However, there are many other athletes who, despite the doping past, are competing at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
It has been blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is number one in the world in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to take a six-month lock in 2010 after having been proven to take the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, the world champion of 2013 and the European champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively for the banned stimulant methyl hexanamin.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking it and was closed for six months.
The four largest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favoritin.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positively in 2010 and was closed for 21 months.
A penile enlargement agent had been responsible, Merritt asserted.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 metres is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently deprived of so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later, after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old also had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a verdict of the International Sports Court CAS.
==References====External links==
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was only tested positively in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of the ingestion of a forbidden food supplement, the ban of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell out mildly and expired on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She had planned her trip home for the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, says Schnöll.
In the Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded first on Thursday evening in a nightlife area.
According to the police, one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more IEDs went up again, killing another person according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
During the detonation near the beach Patong, which is popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to the police.
In Surat Thani, on the southeastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosives blew up in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injuries.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee in front of journalists on Friday.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to express itself on possible motives, but probably it was the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received classified evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage strongly recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is advised not to travel to these provinces.
Increased safety risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This also gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is taking advantage of itself to restore stability and order to the Kingdom.
However, the military did not manage to control the uprising of Muslim rebels, which has been in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
About a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"In the 'Identitarian Movement', we see evidence of efforts against the fundamental democratic freedom," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection at the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constituent defenders in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "identitarians".
Maaßen said that his authority had been closely in agreement with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of the constitutional protection department.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
That is what Islamists do as well as right-wing extremists do.
That's not a covert advertisement for your own business.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
It's dangerous.
Most recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" to AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of that.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point on.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain persons who are extremist, and thus becomes extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not apparent.
In view of the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or small groups are formed that are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide management of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups had emerged at the regional level or in social networks.
Concerned, Maaßen said that many attacks have taken place on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right-hand scene.
That is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or have chosen CDU, SPD or left, for example, but who have then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist sentimentalism."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old nevertheless participates in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, Hate simply wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the rounds.
Some media referred to him as the "Robel der Wal".
Following a "well-being belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete alone in a preliminary run over 100 meters of freestyle.
At that time Moussambani was fired in Frenetisch.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neuer Platz has been robbed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her shop at 5.30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning around 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the impending election defeat so tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If the election to the U.S. President is nothing, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll go on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the U.S. presidential elections in November, he wouldn't mind: "Ultimately it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CNBC.
If, in the end, it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, said Trump.
This is how he described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle seems to be great.
The Post also plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle.
In the near future, the Group intends to start trading with the transporter.
The post office wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get involved in the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
For months now, the company has been testing whether it is to sell its own developed StreetScooter, with which letters and parcels are delivered, to other companies.
Post-CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always inquiries, for example from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based company intends to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In the post-owned manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and aim for a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hartmann would become the more uncertain the longer the successes he promised would be.
Turbulence at the head of Nuremberg's market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management, the world's number five industry is facing a new start in terms of personnel.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the Management Board will take over Gerhard Hausruckinger as of 1 September, the company announced.
He is to officially assume the role of "CEO" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman didn't want to mention any details on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders were most recently disappointed by the continuing success of the restructuring that started years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"However, the fruits of the restructuring are still not visible after 5 years," it said.
Given the last bad GfK business figures, every shareholder will eventually become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, so would the Quandts," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With respect to the first half of the year, sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 721.2 million.
Earnings in the second quarter were mainly burdened by the company's lower value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-offs of EUR 139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit, resulted in a net loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in an accident involving 43 elderly passengers in Krummhörn (Aurich County) on Thursday.
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police reported.
According to her, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an accommodating truck, which partly ran on the other side of the road.
The bus came to the right of the street and slipped into a ditch, as reported by a spokesperson for the Aurich/Wittmund police.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade liberated the inmates.
Six ambulances and one ambulance came to the scene of the accident on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travellers were brought back to the Krummhörn district of Pewsum by a bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater will amount to 3.44 euros from 1 October 2016 for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant instead of 2.10 euros; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an excessive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported that when the house was approved by the Kulmbach Landratsamt (Landratsamt Kulmbach) it was established that there were gaps in these wastewater facilities.
The market Kasendorf is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the plants cost-coveringly.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverage from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The serious fee increases were due to the fact that all three waste water plants were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water intake, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the waste water generation in all three plants has declined slightly.
Furthermore, during the previous calculation period, all three plants had incurred a significant amount of renovation and repair costs, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the wastewater plant Azendorf due to damage.
The almost 20-year-old conveyors had to be overhauled from the ground up in the pumping plant Welschenkahl and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be excavated, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were met by the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account in the new calculation period accordingly."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still well below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low waste water intake in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance "fully penetrate".
Schmidt added that the market community was spared large maintenance costs at the wastewater plants in the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above plants would remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water association could not be expanded by these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest figure (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed for the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, property twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism in which they were accused of promoting Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian - "Yellow Face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced Rassissmus reminded the filter of injurious clichés.
Others strongly rejected the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely circulated, wrote that the filter was "harmful and to say the least unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder for such things to remain unnoticed than they used to," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Medium Engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that race-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she doesn't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in her workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a human resources manager focused on under-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she would have her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, notes Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual situation on the ground would have allowed, a Congress Committee of Inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committees and the Military Budget Commission, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts, who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command (Cencom) is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Message-related information, typically nodded down by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, noted.
The leadership mistakes in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that Obama's leaders have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have been exposed to the pressure from their presidencies to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than they were in fact," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it's so clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay ISIS's threat in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports into the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for producing intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morale of analysts, and "gave too little room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of White House intervention by the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations conducted by the Pentagon's Inspector General, who, after complaints from Centcom analysts, was admitted.
Lieutenant Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress, while the investigation by the Inspector General was still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
Last year's accusations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism about the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of differences of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only had a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government officials, Mr. Hooker's team found that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as they would have put provisional refineries into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is coming
One day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who remember their gates.
However, she knows this: the American women are in the 4-0 Olympic competition and are in the first place in their group with the British women, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win first and second place respectively.
The first-placed person will avoid the strong Dutch women who lead the other group a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of the game on Saturday, the American women have caused a surprising whirl through their success story, four years after they ended up in the last 12 places at the previous London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympic Games in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team, and things began to turn for the better.
"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to pull the rudder around completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She did a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and swiped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging race between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow shooter to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been under these well-known names, which are broadcast at Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I could modestly make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely for the last 16 years that many of the people I had interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outside arm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon tremors of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means "jumpboard."
Aspiring victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to make a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
In their pursuit of gold, medal-hoppers must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only chase the finish line or the starting wall, but also another humiliating goal in the television broadcast: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I feel to be a bit tiring when I watch these games.
The trampoline offers a breather.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise, there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by angaffing and objectification of male athletes - as the male US-Turners recently suggested - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his air-wringing, new fan base.
"A Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long an Ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos in circulation about the protests, which are probably from the last or early part of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now demands an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have consistently led the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and these have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
One generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to strangleholds with regard to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the Eritrean border; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of simmering under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more frequent and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But that, too, is changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 due to an unpublished illness.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly savvy at perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using Special Envoy to work on opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last few months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal displeasure.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked Tigray-led businesses and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge hike."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State Terrorist Group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also brings his fellow fighters, who try to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back on the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is crushing Mr. Trump while trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already advanced sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he expressed strong criticism when he thought the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later said, "Of course, I meant sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" according to how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his polling figures have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstood his humor.
But while he is increasingly focused on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a Thursday CNN interview.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," Mr. Giuliani said, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true, in this sense, that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenches, completely wrong, and it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania campaign events on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" TV experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.
Once displaced by the price from the market, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, that Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's a new invention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working with Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch office, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was coffee and culture in the verb I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if on that day she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he replaces his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he had no resentment about the soap business taking over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to respond to your offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he plans to exhibit it soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to bottle and sell the cold brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a soft spot for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was somewhat more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, no-frills snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Real foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have gone like lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pie for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country was dealing with being no longer the land of the Schlaraffen.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: Mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Ziegelman remarked, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a cremated sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at noon," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or ever since, householders - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove the eating habits of the country in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "domestic politicians" and meet the challenge of turning pamphlet like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's lass-me-cake-food attitude, are tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully alien from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleak."
Many of the species from the Great Depression era, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the pflaumendessert, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone grudgingly immersed a spoon in the tough, brown glitter.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up a reference three times.
Like a can-do-budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, has saved nearly 60,000 lives so far.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said according to the picture: "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had talked about the last bombings in Syria in a video.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathlessness.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a recipe for an old age.
In any case, Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" about a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
"Delusion," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commenting on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks become stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers therefore know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
However, these sharks do prey: in an animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal, while another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and seek cadavers that torple down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fisherman had taken from Greenland or Spitsbergen as by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres long.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lens core of the sharks.
This center of the eye lens is formed even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments hurled larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third-smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, however, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons experiments, so it probably celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland sharks only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously take at least one and a half centuries to reproduce.
This, too, is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such methuseles live above all in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon stuck a 120-year-old harpoon tip on the neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on a saving flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains Scheuerlein, the evolutionary biologist.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
In the most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on topics relating to building.
With relief, the panel welcomed Mayor Robert Putz's announcement that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parceling and development questions could be clarified and the applications for surveying could be submitted, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the land in the residential areas "Strasslweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstrasse area - extension section 1) to interested parties.
The municipality council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal equally to young families and up-to-date seniors.
As it was said, those willing to build can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the parcels in its September meeting.
In order to be able to meet requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises, together with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the newly created land use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
In the Unterzeitlarn area, for example, the industrial area already designated there is extended by two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of Main therefore has the best chance of attracting relocated jobs and firms from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets Competence Area.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
The so-called EU passport has so far been enough for them to be admitted to the UK.
That's what big US banks are using right now.
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the euro area's largest banks, and other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision (EIOPA) and the ESRB Risk Board, says the IW.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had its headquarters, but this was less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as it enables them to communicate directly with supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg, although home to a large fund sector, is worse off than Dublin in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris, it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties were also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
The city ranked seventh in a ranking of Mercer's management consultancy, 19th in Luxembourg, 33rd in Dublin and 37th in Paris.
Although quality of life is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," concludes the IW.
Despite Brexit vote, however, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, economic researchers say.
In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, compared with 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million payment of damages for the violation of two patents by Merck related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was filed on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to waive the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of the laboratory work on which Sofosbuvir was based, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city, said a group spokesman on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the Manbij Military Councillor Reuters, allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're just doing clean-up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in redeployment fees; the former Foreign Minister reported an income of USD 3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her term of office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice Presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, have published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backslidings in relation to his promises to date to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not legally obliged to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated as the reason for his refusal a tax audit by the tax authorities.
"You're on the move," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, on Twitter, regarding the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits have been completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charitable organizations, his business conduct, and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already jumped on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump is calling for his tax return to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump did not pay or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called for Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subject to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had "fear" of the voters and not of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax return showed that they received only USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund that taxed Clinton's dividends and income of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to people-occupied settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powders.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has stepped up its funding together with the U.S. nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World elephant day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the toolkit, we have seen a change in their attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep elephants from their fields without harming elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition line.
When lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant away.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain firework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk on the St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects of traders accept with a kiss hand - after all, the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a new sale kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"We generally welcome new traders, but this kiosk does not fit in at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after betraying that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli prefix, as it "demanded" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via its own call center.
After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel clerk said that the measure was "an intentional decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the code be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were appalled and dismayed by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
That doesn't require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to "take the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big response on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some assumed to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have given in to the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," it said in another article, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all accusations and called the incident an "accident" and "apologize" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order to not include Israel in the rapid election list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti spraying on walls against the provisional President Michel Temer.
The most recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators took to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate to dismiss him.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies' interest in the country's business has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upswing was achieved by supplying machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian embassy abroad issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, are being broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses Wanted: Beverage Market in Waldbröl ambushed
A robbery took place on Thursday evening at the drinks market of Rewe XXL on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With a gun in store, three darkly dressed people who had mumbled their faces demanded the release of cash from the employees of the beverage market and then fled on foot and probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
The police don't tell us how much money was captured.
The perpetrators were between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
The perpetrators must have run after the attack towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations related to the robbery at the time of the crime (at 7:45 p.m.) should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun during summer holidays
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social pedagogical day group/social group work of the children's protection association Nagold with their carers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwäldle the happy group was accommodated during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the agenda.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with a visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited for jumping, swimming and splashing.
Children and carers were spoiled with their self-prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewels of pearls and stones were created, or a Roman mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home contentedly.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Door of Mercy
The ministrants from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all the Ministrants in two years, the Oberministrantenrunde St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the portal of mercy opened for this purpose at Freiburg's Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set out on their way.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage crosses and gave the blessing to the pilgrims.
From Horb a train was taken to the starting point Villingen, where a Münster Our Lady is also standing and the pilgrimage path from Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches made time and again rest in order to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgrim song booklet.
For the overnight stays, the parishes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, had to be descended in humid heat about 500 meters of altitude and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bath consecration in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage in Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster in the later afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening mass in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were greeted by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotsman Callum Skinner storms home when Brite wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's team sprint at Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took over the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boy-pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to take a victory from New Zealand's favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the London World Championships in March, despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at Kenny's and Hoys' side, Hindes admitted that he was deliberately falling on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags in the grandstand."
We've been teaming up in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the shape of Kenny it is possible that he will repeat Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born).
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I enjoy this only for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had argued yesterday with officers before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.
In the women's competition that will continue and finish tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to attract a crowd of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.
Dramas took place in the background, according to technical director Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition at Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of the Portland melting plant in question as a result of the repeal of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A subsidy fixed for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the Portland plant will continue to operate, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the melting plant," the company announced.
AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called "secure transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"As a result, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong future markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $ 187 million in "Expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts did not affect the "ability of Alcoa to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant."
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it still owes an explanation as to why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions in the industry.
Referring to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
If both installations were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as generators," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder's brand ambassador, who ran Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover was revealed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), a scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn's problems as well as the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets her sister's cover and ends with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast site at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her about the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on show in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a scope that is more like a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the waltz).
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that images of the magazine leaked in the last two years before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "famous models" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticized her and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on displeasure seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your primer from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people per year
More than 160,000 of the country's most needy are rejected by municipal law centres each year, while the sector is prepared for the impact of further budget cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogging and the like - are already turned away when they apply for free legal advice and counsel.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-exploited, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The Director of Queesland Municipal Law Centres James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the Federal Government's decision to lift it.
"Queensland's municipal law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and Minister of Justice, as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their customer communities, as well as the fact that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun at an employee in February while they were on their way in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini claimed to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee throat," said Bordini in his charge.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment people - firearm owners and gun friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and appointed judge.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had pulled his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for personal injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press officer Hope Hicks was unable to reach for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The proceedings are Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) show significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys by the INSA Opinion Research Institute for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could just continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have a good chance of remaining the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party would only be just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4%) and the AfD would be represented in the Landtag for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are back in the Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin election (election 2011: 28.3%).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, whereas the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and taller, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but somehow they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the back pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the Communicator was reachable.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, although painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
The prize was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online all the time and everywhere, this is everyday life for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-run business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
An entire industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple's triumph began, and today the iPhone is the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had to look for it.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn how to put the smartphone away," Janina Kugel said, responsible for personnel at the Siemens Board of Management.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just like in 2012 in London, when we spent a lot of time making sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of scientific growth and leaving behind a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program into time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row as the world's best airport terminal, to the T2 built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalks in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are equivalent to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect ad blockings as to which part of the site is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams' spokesman wrote that "this kind of back and forth struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and the walkers has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile social network and Instagram app, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs represents a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worthwhile investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its ad preferences tool to give people more control over targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we are planning to address the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman overrun on Swiss highway in suspected suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was hit on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday during a suspected suicide by several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but some have still not been identified, the police said, asking them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who was one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and lost consciousness on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-density atmosphere, could have had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to shelter life and protect from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent duller.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to that of evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left behind -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as the Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president of hockey operations, leading to a too low right of co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and only wish him the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach in the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second Wildcard Spot at the Western Conference.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start talks again, strike out
The labour disputes concerning the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-launch the resolution process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will start early next year to tackle the problems.
The unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has this year cut the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10% decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which had been exacerbated by the British's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars in the cluster rotate to different rates and in what context the rotational periods are associated with planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of Pleiades is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which originated about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' "ballet," we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the cluster of stars of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The cluster of Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us about which we would like to learn more, how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star kicks off
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees one last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was named the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back for a long time with performance.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees, he achieved some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the fame hall of baseball.
For as successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted that it had taken prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, due to a involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal, he was suspended for 211 games until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-promoting funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I've been through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said suffocatingly at the time.
Even his farewell days are not silent.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz, and who is said to have been with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy statements from fans of Yankee Erzrivalen Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympic 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping events became known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metres-thickness runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - just before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions these news come at an untimely time.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The CAS International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the 50 m freestyle races.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-sample and hold a hearing.
The national association "takes the matter very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," said Xinhua from a statement: "We will cooperate with the CAS International Sports Court and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, news of the positive rehearsal at Danekova leaked, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said, "this is an incredible shock."
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance is to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT the B-sample was already positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days earlier positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both contest the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the track athletes, the case of Danekova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.
The world association IAAF had forbidden the entire Russian team to start due to systematic dopings, but also the Kenyan runner nation produces a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of an engagement with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and respect for doping cheaters," he said.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidin at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but only had to hold a three-month lock.
Data claw: So perfidious hackers blackmail their ransom
Blackmail malware programmers are currently targeting companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an attack with extortion software at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes several times.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already target of ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransomers demanded by the perpetrators to re-use the attacked systems and data.
According to the observations of malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially blackmailing ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a frighteningly fast evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has been horrifyingly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it specifically searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the end encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt their business activities, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
Managers find it difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and concluded that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from ransomware extortion, hackers become more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that there are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and hire another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Traditionally, the criminals then commission spammers to spread them," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on the ability to ward off ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful effusion, the perpetrators threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the type of data, the potential damage is thus much higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also set completely new targets on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One in all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not seem narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top side falls off a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage.
Not only is there a trunk of 453 l available with raised and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinema armchairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The boot can be loaded well, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-litre gasoline engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane holding assistant.
The collision warning sometimes irritates, because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when shunting.
The main-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed control responds to traffic sign detection and reduces speed if necessary.
The full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued that liability is only conceivable in the event of risks that are typical of air transport (see point 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness: When the organiser pays
After their journey, sick holidaymakers will only get money back if the cause of the disease is clearly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family suffered from diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their vacation in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which had allegedly polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the trip was deficient - and complained against the organiser.
In court, the plaintiffs did not succeed.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was fine.
He therefore did not violate his obligations to provide information, according to the judgment.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion with one another - is part of the general risk of life.
Out of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to react calmly and resolutely to terrorist threats at the same time.
It is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
This triumph will not be granted to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this would increase security and also increase people's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years".
sympathies for terrorism had to be re-punished.
The aim is to improve video surveillance, improve arms law in such a way that it is particularly difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet.
According to de Maizière's words, the duty of secrecy for doctors, which has been much discussed, is to be preserved.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he said that he wanted to find solutions to reduce the threat to citizens.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
De Maizière plans to use covert investigators to prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet).
SPD boss Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was a slap in the face for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burka and the abolition of double nationality.
He felt that a general ban on full veiling was a constitutional problem.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
One could talk about rules in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green boss Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate power and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Floor sayings and a tightening of the right of residence will no longer bring security to people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It is regularly standing on the bypass road - here a picture from November.
But this is to change: the right-hand lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Straßenbau (Landesbetrieb Straßenbau) will extend the right-hand lane by 700 metres next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße.
Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Straße to the right.
The big advantage is that traffic splits up at an early stage, improving the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the feeder bugs the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On working days, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the Weseler Straße exit.
From here the traffic is steered only one-lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled about three-quarters years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to take up the heavy-duty traffic two-lane in particular.
How long this bottleneck and the associated daily traffic jam will last, cannot be said by the responsible national company.
However, years are to be expected: The bridge has an official residual useful life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand turn lane, the state company has deliberately chosen the less traffic-related time during the school holidays, because disabilities are to be expected.
The traffic will be run one-lane past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" by the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the production at the Kleine Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migrant and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most young people in the class had come to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were still able to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migrant backgrounds between 14 and 20 years of age will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather hit the star-snow-gackers in the south-west of Germany in the night on Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for observing the celestial spectacle because of clouds and rain, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
The star sheds are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful night: tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep long before the alarm clock rings.
This is far from relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on various causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this is the insomnia, i.e. an insomnia and sleep disorder.
Many people feel that sleeping through is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors of the German Family Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs, can be involved.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"A very early awakening is common, especially in case of depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are interdependent.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can lie down badly, wake up every two or three hours, and you may begin to ponder about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you become a doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, Weeß advises you to go to the doctor.
The impairment can look very different: you are tired, tired, sleepless, have difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or even medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any abandoned sleep physicians in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Weeß advises that sleep problems should first be addressed to the family doctor.
He can check whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what's happening?
For example, physicians advise to examine in the sleep laboratory in the case of snoring with breath loss, in case of morbid day fatigue, in sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't make a nap," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a noseglass, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can people affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular sleep and rest periods, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then one starts to count immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the Jungle Camp has to offer with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler spoke on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the short-haul World Championships in Doha and set his first world record at the same time.
The former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now stood up via Facebook to his critical former teammates.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle king 150.000 € no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The promotion system in swimming sport is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the issue of doping or even do it.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Deutschland (NADA).
That's exactly how you should keep it with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent controllers of the WADA/FINA for a certain time before the World Cup/OS cannot participate," demands the Wahl-Hamburger, who now operates an ice cream parlour.
Airport: Gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, the Düsseldorf police arrested two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspects had committed several pocket and baggage thefts as a gang.
At around 9.30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had taken joint, part-time and particularly professional action.
The specialists of the Crime Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically for the purpose of committing crimes.
In total, they had won over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between a rest of the cobblestone pavement: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like it at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioshop.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the facade of a grey house.
Opposite a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the real estate company Friedrichshain calls them, are preferably illustrated with burning cars in the last few weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, on the ground floor however still spaces are occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's interior senator Henkel had spoken out on several occasions in favour of a tough police action against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the ground floor rooms, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of the Spati.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
They share with the residents of the house projects the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a neighbourhood, which mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench opened by the Berlin Interior Senator and the police between squatters and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter, which still today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupancy and the resulting housing projects have also been part of the neighbourhood for a long time: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße near the Rigaer.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a veritable street battle under a large police force, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election Berliners from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighbourhood.
This is also noticeable in rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognized by cast-in windows or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.
No other street was so often mentioned this year along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors consider this a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to affect the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in an apartment building next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there is no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is appeased: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars have not been in Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Rigaer Straße - and remained.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their streets back: from the police, the politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
"After all, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well clothed live here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what can you do if nobody ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of the neighbourhood.
Those who move here should be aware of this - just as someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the administration team of Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all actors: refugees, working group on refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-legging woolen milk sow, which has a problem above all.
Thus, some had meant - less spooky than aimed at the multitude of desired areas of work - when the administration wanted to tender the job.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, was sought for an egg-legging woolen milk sow.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it was about organisation, working with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50-percent position for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, Annika Deuschle supporting honorable and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be in Wasenstrasse
It has been a serious problem for some time now to find homes for the refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented housing.
The local authorities themselves must bear the costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations.
The responsibility changes from the county council office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time now.
De facto, the administration does not find private dwellings.
So far, it has not worked, according to Deuschle, to rely on private homes.
Therefore, common homes need to be upgraded, as they say.
So new containers will soon be installed in Wasenstrasse.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or established.
"More seats would be good," reports Regine customer.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do charitable work - and that is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is "no occupational therapy".
Activity, however, does not mean just work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So this is where the administration and volunteers jump in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, must not work and is useless, will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
However, there are also problems, customer honestly says, "People who don't work at all". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.
All this is already a mammoth task.
A difficult question: are the two afraid of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde very clearly, "what some may call naive." However, a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents were also a topic for the refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would completely discredit her.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So principals and volunteers must look for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new boost to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
Policy is afraid to answer this question clearly.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on site.
"We have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already used to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Searching for burglars with helicopter
The police helicopter flew off various areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men forcibly invaded an apartment in an apartment building on Lindenweg at 8.50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The inhabitant surprised the two and struck the disloyal to flee.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hooded jumpers.
They fled downtown.
The police used several patrol crews and a police helicopter for the search.
The search went unsuccessfully.
Perhaps the unknown were noticed before the act near the apartment or when they fled.
