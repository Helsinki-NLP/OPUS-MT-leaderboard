Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, total they reach 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the tip.
In contrast, the election leader of the alliance prepares for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian state governor Jörg Haider, for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP cut even worse, losing almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially of the People's Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
But voters probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party bureau.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received 18 percent, while the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fears that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party and the Populists agreed (then the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) on a joint government, which had even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party, is obviously relying on this development and expects a return to Vienna to Austria's federal policy.
In addition, the Green Party moved into parliament, which suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percent hurdle and therefore did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If we fail to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused of illegal gathering of beetles in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that some cooling down of Czech-Indian relations could occur.
This was stressed by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't work out, then surely, there will be some cooling down," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of everything, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the indictment and received a fine, the central government wanted to deal with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case law the matter was dealt with.
"His problem could be resolved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukherdshi to appeal at a higher court.
He could ask for release on bail and wait freely for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had spoken the same way during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be possible for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to have the condemned "competent legal support" promoted, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to Czech press agency ČTK, in front of its partner, the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and sue these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister gave an answer to the question whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I have already been promised quite a lot," he merely stated.
A Czech judge over the wrestling around the seabed
He approaches an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-strong staff members of the UN-Divison for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His head, the divisional director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
This is where work elan and enthusiasm prevail.
To date, the seabed has a little-known world rich in natural springs.
Oil can be found here, further ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently declared their entitlement to the new maritime areas.
According to a UN convention, they exercise their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the shore sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas, recently met with an international response.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed granted to the country by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times more than the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profits that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do so for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which the Convention calls "the common heritage of humanity".
Then no state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted to an international institution set up by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," says Director Mikulka with a little exaggeration, adding that his "individual areas are precisely defined by law and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, it received the status of a so-called "groundbreaking investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is arranged there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"One can support there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary Schem, which according to legend brought the Golem to life.
German Special Forces were on the ground during hostage release
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not deployed.
On the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details are becoming known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists from the Bundeswehr and officials from the GSG 9, the flight squadron of the Bundespolizei, the Bundeskriminalamt as well as logistics experts from the Technische Hilfswerk were at the place of liberation.
However, the German forces were not needed, as spokesmen of the ministries reported on Monday evening, because the hostage-takers let their prisoners go and fled when they saw signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"Luckily, this has not happened," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had abducted the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions on 19 September in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been deported back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
Until recently, the identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have arrived safely in Cairo by now.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The US Congress's first chamber has made the $700 billion bailout for the financial markets fail very scarcely.
The Dow Jones rushed into the depths.
By 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority in favour of the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on MEPs to give their assent, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones collapsed by more than six percent or by 600 points.
Investors were worried that the state bailout might fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote and then, after noticing the failure, crashed again.
Experts are now expecting further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the programme to enter into force.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to a study, sales for travel bookings for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
In spite of weak economic prospects, according to a study, the Germans' desire to travel remains undisturbed.
When booking for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the same period last year, as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the study of the market research institute GfK, booking figures have already increased for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in sales of travel agencies for October amounted to around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results are figures of the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates for the overall market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 are recorded.
Due to the weak dollar price, trips to the USA are particularly needed, the DRV said.
Here the increase in the booking amount to about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local areas, are particularly popular destinations for the Germans.
In particular, package travel is highly on course, said DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "better calculable for the customer than for individually organised holidays".
Among other things, consumers could save money through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that there will be another increase in sales compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans travelling fell compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-hits in the endless loop, beer from Liter-Krügen and celebrities in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, television presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already rushing at us and snapping the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
When Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Weißwurstäquator, the feeling of well-being in the costumes remained limited until then.
But once arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reaps my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman informs me that I had wrongly bound the apron: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, behind widowed."
Secretly, I felt the loop from the back to the left.
"Suits," he said, laughing.
Others make less effort to use subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked back to an uninvited one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is Bob, comes from England and visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "ooooo".
That's what he tells me after he's rid himself of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks he's a trash can.
So Bob's one of those infamous "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in crowds across the festival ground, who have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Empty down, fully back again.
You can't see who's in the promille jar under the tarpaulin.
"These are the ones that goarnimmer pack," one of the paramedics shouted to me on request and disappeared in the tumult.
Name of the victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, residing on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspecting reckless driving.
Meanwhile, he was released on bail.
Turkey broadens the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building decays about
But once you're inside the vaulted ticket counter, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose most western access this was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late migrant in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and further beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans were faltering during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions train flew into the air, destroying the artful roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling judicial and development party, the AKP, has introduced a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighbouring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I went on the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy journey on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state plan to turn back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP's main office, a specially designed ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exceptional phenomenon," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, it has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could eventually," I asked, "must be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to have to face this decision."
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone I talked to here said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that, in the figurative sense, Europe as a whole can travel on the same rail tracks eastward towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building build 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, lie in Turkey's hands.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry that was supposed to take me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was "Death" Handley (Obituary on September 11) in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir was singing for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to tackle any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never been read for years.
How often did death hold us to "let music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never insolent but never inexhaustible.
Whatever the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he was the director of the Guildford Philharmonic.
For the past 40 years, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply "goed home with one or two famous show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Fellowship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 under a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor had a large interior, this large-scale sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical finesse, which allows even more comfortable driving and fuel saving.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this grand sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
However, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After jazz had appeared on the market, around one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, 17% of the assumed growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the head of the branch in Spain expects to be able to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales decline in Spain.
In reality, the head of the brand hopes to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8 % compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States while remaining shares are distributed across the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, besides the additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both versions have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the output of 90 hp at 6 000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz achieves 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Car Bee' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, to be precise, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight room, which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
But the most important are the bee's faceted eyes, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, which allows her to fly undisturbed in her personal airspace without interruption.
In order to recreate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles located in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an in-vehicle microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal to avoid collision
`At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasive maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the senior engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can neither deviate upwards or downwards, but it can also not exceed; it can move only on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require neither the information nor the intuitive logic of the maneuvers carried out, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite in order to lead to the destination while driving, avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She's trembling before she gets charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognised that the US Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the US citizens being involved in mortgage stories of supposedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for the Internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or perhaps, the 'hotel of bad loans' or of confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, two and up to three times if it is the moment to not ask for a loan.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamlike room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides her capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its stock market price.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a uniform price of 25.25 dollars, which amounts to a total of three billion dollars.
The price assumed is less than 19% of the share price of August 31st.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure a profit of 10% and can be re-sold at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share dropped by 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
‘This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank,' said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which is supposed to allow him to extend their business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply declared that she would sell up to 20% of her shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
‘A week ago', Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, said in Tokyo, ‘we thought that the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their price for their Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction in earnings of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% above the value of the sale, i.e. at approximately 47 dollars, within a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to exploit investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a press spokesman from the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August he had 'significantly' lowered his balance sheet.
The last few weeks have been hard for the group that had to watch their stock market price decline by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency has increased.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at around 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refound the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was that third person who, this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded and friends, put the plan of a new constitution for election.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results, which amounted to 80% of the vote, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% voted 'no', and 0.7% were cast blank.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations' exits and a census of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for 'yes', prophesying to him 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, by the way, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held silently according to the observational delegation of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transfers the power of the state to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that largely lives from oil production by foreign companies and from foreign currencies that send emigrants to the country.
The project, which is being promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the Head of State greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorial base as a base for American antidrug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian command started the attack on the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital in a healthy and unscathed manner this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they had been liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base right next to Cairo International Airport at around 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to talk to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreigner district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and the hijackers 'were not paid a ransom', said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the runway.
After being captured on September 19 in an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
They are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Agency Egyptus, organiser of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the Special Forces launched the attack at night, just before dawn, on board two helicopters.
'On both sides, shots were fired and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this person in charge, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is, on the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the intelligence service and special forces,' he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in a patrol, where the kidnappers were, six of whom were killed, including Chad's leader, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately denied the movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving to death?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is making 3.5 million euros available solely for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, by all Members of Parliament and by all government districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies are trying to deal intensively with history, to save the numerous private archives with a few dime, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments national parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states want to use the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been turbulenced by the US financial crisis, to help: The three states make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the bank and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the European Commission's Competition Authority.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the bank could be a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at around 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell some of its holdings, especially the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep descent last week, and serious crisis scenarios were already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too large for a bankruptcy.
The institution's securities fell by 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion US bailout package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets are responsible for the downfall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested party with a factual offer was found.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should trembl for his money, it was said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the henhouse
Because of a person's drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox to the chickens" - quoted the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurances determine the fees as well as the payment amounts in case of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance will not be taken out at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper method: Based on the customer's identification number, he obtains the data from the pharmacies for the last one and a half years, i.e., which products were purchased, and the program calculates from what illness the customer suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medication, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically lead him to a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurance only has to do the paperwork more, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be taken for various purposes, such as migraines and hot flushes, but also against depression.
The latter is, from the insurer's point of view, a high risk factor, while the latter is not.
For the query and processing of the data, own societies have formed, which, before receiving the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with the data on drug use. Thus, they provide an even more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate law on data protection for health data, its effect is limited to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, as the insurance companies otherwise do not enter into a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the fox's mercy.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main topic among other global problems at the ninth summit.
The Franco-Indian summit is also taking place today, where the main subject of discussion is cooperation in the nuclear sector.
While the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more voice and voice on international issues, the member states have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. increase it to a good 100 billion euros.
Given that trade in goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement so that air transport will also be encouraged in the future.
India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim was to achieve a balance in the current imbalance between the EU and India: while the Union is the number one partner in India, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also perpetrated.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides to blame for failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, i.e. that pollutant emissions are to be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as did the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, contracts to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India are expected.
According to the Agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
For the current event, the international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will spread over 17,790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of foreign writers' books is decreasing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane disappeared a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a plateau of 3000 m above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely disenchanted the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located and a force has been sent out to do so. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Traffic Safety (Ntsb) noted that just a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, a crew was sent out to identify the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett started a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two ID cards called Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, in his sixth attempt, he was the first person to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover with an airplane.
Among his several records also counts a height flight of 15445 m over the Andes, however, this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv that falls out of the conventional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to breathe new breath into the sector.
Due to its exceptional characteristics, the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, to be carried out in various lanes, which will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first fase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, whereby 3D glasses, which are distributed near the Corso Como, will give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so seemingly from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its details in order to reassemble as a whole.
Without a doubt, it is Mercedes' concern with this advertisement to introduce a new type of autoreclame into this rather stereotyped field.
But will it succeed in stimulating the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from Triveneto – now they risk banning stadiums
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, has not caused any serious problems until recently.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The conveyors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined by other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly radical right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
Of the Figc, 144 cards were made available to Italian fans for the game: all were issued in names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia there was no one with a running stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this regard, were denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested Tifosi, who are identified in the riots, can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Luckily.
But now there is, of course, fear of copycats, which could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be eliminated immediately and that under no circumstances give such behaviour the possibility of justification," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "Eyes on above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Indeed, in Puglia there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports inspectorate) gathers, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly in no joy), who for a few weeks has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and afterwards Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, came from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but without a doubt this behaviour of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punished in the country of their crime.
So far, this group had been in control, but now it has to be reconsidered what has happened and will happen.
But let us also talk about the whistles during the anthem Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but allow me, because there is no education...".
