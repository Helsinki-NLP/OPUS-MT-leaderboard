A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by affirming that election fraud in the US is less frequent than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republican lawyers have, by the way, recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting the elections in each country.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make the registration or registration procedure more difficult.
This phenomenon has become more important after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as voters on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a judicial act is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state asked voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law in 2008.
The Republican authorities have hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted legislation in 34 states that force voters to display a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million persons entitled to vote, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such an ID card in 2012.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to get the required ID.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
That goes even further.
Students who are regarded as voters, who increasingly vote for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws calling on voters to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
For it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states in 2011, which abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns to register voters in the general elections in 2004 have helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the number of new voters registered by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they represent only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The US Advocate General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require a photo ID to be shown.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the countries that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral panel to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test has sometimes flawed results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for the conduct of early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
In the US studies, there were numerous disruptive factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and providing clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in mortality in patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that, following follow-up after 12 years, the probability of metastases being formed is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That's why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of Afro-American origin are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are types of cancer that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be made fully aware of the extent of the risk of his cancer by identifying the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term and in these cases it is more likely to be actively monitored.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and treatment when the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be determined with increasing accuracy.
That's why I still recommend carrying out the test.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that allows us to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PPE test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer can be prevented if everyone eats well and moves sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly damages people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of cancer dying is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, Grimmdar, rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colorectal cancer throughout life," he adds.
Diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much it increases the risk of developing cancer of the Grimm or rectum.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their investigations, however, are not conclusive at present.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study has found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson last summer caused a certain stir, and for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or least false explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
Without the shadow of doubt, we know that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics congress in Kyoto this week, but there is still a lack of data to be completely secure about it.
Nevertheless, let us assume that it is actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let us look at what it is about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that causes two objects to not be present in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state", whereby this "state" consists largely of some of its properties.
From this the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and obey the Pauli principle in a way.
And in the other, the bosons, a bad bond of anarchists, who have nothing sacred - definitely not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "disrupted" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond whose surface could only be shattered by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - is required to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are in fact not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator by itself.
And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
For what can all these researches be "good", asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to examine in detail all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who are eagerly hoping that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great defects, since it does not explain gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were none.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous stroke laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was regarded as a "laboratory game" at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... 的 Le Devoir
With its Committee on Deaths in Dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed him, had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigns to let himself be helped with the meal.
Bravely, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's home.
Returning to the childhood phase is unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"That depends on the person's ability to take a step backwards, he notes.
In the opinion of several people who work in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these regressions.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, doctors and nurses who take care of them no longer overwhelm them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and through suffocation".
But through the illness, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says, before accepting that she is wearing a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she still expects a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide personal care and help with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we'll all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You give the dying person a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served Mr. X a beer that died over the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
There's no day like the other at Victor-Gadbois's.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family reunion in the yard and is well supported by his pillows while being exposed in his honor, a young man of 36 who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel with concern.
53% of the patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. a care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, are more or less specializing exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec's healthcare system that has led several specialists in palliative care to look forward to adopting a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without taking any action to alleviate her.
I fear that the only reason patients want to die is because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients until the last day despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she replied that she regretted giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not accepting this wish after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care in Montreal's home palliative care society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in either sporadically or permanently tossing the patient until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated, all say the same sentence, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be eased."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from the Road Construction Office, companies in the main construction industry, money collectors from political parties and specialists from the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso are involved.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system is disintegrating since drastic measures have been taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Parliament in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police Department.
The scandal was revealed by an in-depth investigation of the embezzlement of the road works contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some were restraining their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops of auditors, investigators and government analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau troops", which since 2009 has caused the "channelling cartel" of Montreal to be more reticent in the artificial inflating of contracts...
Over the past few weeks, she has conducted series of house searches and accused of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburban city.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as Italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were explicitly accused.
The latter has attracted attention by declaring to the Commission the operation of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For several years, he himself has paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand everywhere, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had organised illegal funding for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, the costs of which were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars in return for sewerage contracts, the costs of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they could be smeared by artificially inflating the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his cash registers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first deputies of Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a community property from 2010 that was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation that is ultimately being carried out, she says that she is "pulling by a thread that allows to understand the functioning of the system subdued by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty".
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we would need an investigative unit intended only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but above all he thinks about the role of "mandaters who are aware of tactics" if they were not involved in fraud!
Starting from a 70% share of black money in funding the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak gossip of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which he says would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be circulating in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's international reputation and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau asks those who laugh about taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my playing level every day.
And in a game, it's even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don't get excited.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
So they take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals this summer are used to playing very high levels.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
This results in a player like me having to stand up and do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from an injury series.
The trust he placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as the leader.
We're in an ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the second round of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He's already got the budget for it...
In order to become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG is giving itself the means to ensure that this project takes on concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really care to get rid of this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are wrestling for the title, I think we have the guts to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win against Troyes 4-0 in a home game, and you still find something to accuse us of, that's certainly a little frustrating.
You wonder what else people are expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn't managed to qualify for the eighth final since two seasons, and which has also made huge spending!
With regard to the sums invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the game break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we finally won it.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's all the better to talk about a "zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some playtime.
I've seen things there that have strengthened me.
Today I manage to achieve good matches in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must show exemplary behaviour.
What opinion do you have on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the draw forced on 16 October in Spain a prelude game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
In addition, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system designed by banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell five months later to 2 dollars before recovering to around ten dollars today (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as the Credits, which are used to advance in a video game that can be won or bought by games (and sometimes exchanged back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the invoice book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are present in the public accounts accounting book spread throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, whereby the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a dismemberment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money twice (less than 10 minutes) for cheating, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain without linking, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible to a hundred millionths, leaving some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement of the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites providing services to Bitcoin were attacked and Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, a company that is paying with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega lock sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend whereby hierarchical systems are reconsidered in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Moreover, the ECB's report provides for a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be high in the event of the success of this currency.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory again, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished Afghan farmers in particular by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and wounded.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as they did at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys flew over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of the Taliban into Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was out of war due to the struggles of the various rebel groups.
At that time, their takeover of power was seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They were discredited, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fights.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could make use of American subsidies: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be given jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is being watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province that will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralization in the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which had existed since the constitution of 1964, the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been required.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, have international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) dig their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on November 20th.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls' and boys' gymnasiums, French Institute at universities, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military action" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required a large number of local workers, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their wish, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly related civilian aid would be necessary in their favour.
A Constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power of attorney, it has decided to put everything on one map.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months to complete his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been based on a provisional text which has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and creating legal confusion.
This new initiative has only created an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "put right underfoot".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way of ending the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
It is also a way for the President to regain his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is raging throughout the country.
According to an interview with the American weekly magazine Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Especially since an ultimatum is given to the Egyptian people with this recourse to a hasty vote: "You either vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 largely Islamist members of this constituent assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals did not comply with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they believe that they have not been able to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities and civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 people, deputy members, were added in all haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually adopted unanimously.
Incidentally, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention, finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made more strict application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals, who see this only as a propaganda strike, reply to "devilness."
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which recognises the University of Al-Azhar as an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are invited to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see here the first signs of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"Currently, no concrete religious commitment can be seen.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised of the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights organisations have called for.
The latter also share their fears about the text which they consider to be liberating.
Blasphemy is maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unspoiled nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Bowing to the Sacred Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the suckling of the sea storm and fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries, however, are located in Jerusalem.
Believers here follow the path of suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path starts at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave there notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a journey to the heights
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in the year 25 AD.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at an altitude of 450 metres above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins by their own strength.
All others bring a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous ski resort Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited on just one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Judean desert, are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the monument to the children built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands in which they died sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathed there all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salinity and thus even carries non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and medicinal sludge as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm damaged nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
These secrets are hidden in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia ran through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda here, with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets, which are named after zodiac signs.
According to legend, Fortuna is held by all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Tonight evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Listed list for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money on the trip is rather not taken in euros, but in dollars, which can simply be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a expressway and in Haifa the only underground line of the country with six stations, which connects the lower city with the upper city.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which includes transfers for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, marine products, fish without sheds and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you can choose between different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls made from puree beans and peas (Falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-fed cats, who stray comfortably and undisturbed through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an extra $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, prior to the lifting of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading with fake certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme only applies to migrants wishing to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become mandatory in the future for all migrant workers.
In doing so, one must not only pass language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for obtaining and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law also excludes persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Purpose, problem and protection of rights
All the examination bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship with Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to launch the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law came into force in the press: What is the point of the whole thing?
What are the changes in the rule of language skills for both the Russians and the migrant workers?
In particular, according to spokesman of the Migration Authority, the aim was to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, Head of the Representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected from their departure.
Only organized recruitment will 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without work, education, language skills and medical assessment face problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who will put him in a dark, narrow barracks under the pretext of help, where he will endure without food and documents with dozens of his equal months and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"In your home, you will be promised one thing, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be taken off, and you will not receive the promised wage," confirms Tolib Schwaripov, head of the Central Employment Migration Administration of the Tajik Migration Authority.
Don't scold, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they are not only not able to speak the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Free access for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
Russian police personnel know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and that results in cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajike Umed Hushkadamov to journalists.
"Don't worry about the cost of false papers"
Already on the day that the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants could be falsified.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary ink printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be bought easily.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time that they receive time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in crime extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten the law on arms for private arms owners.
The authorities are responding to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead during the rampage of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attracting screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening".
The percentage of crimes involving registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from using themselves on the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors, any weapon for little money can be found in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, there are illegal weapons stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police armory and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
Many military camps often had explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases involved arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
"Nowadays, there are countless private armament factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore throw weapons under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia that organizes smuggling," the former military member explains.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminal literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
According to the investigators, most of the illegal weapons come from the army and legal services.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there because of the "debt of those responsible for their work with weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% from thefts in weapons production, and 5% from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at an arms store who does not want to be named assures that weapons found during illegal excavations have long been bought by no one, since they are outdated.
According to him, it's more common for traders to get supplies in a weapons store.
An ensign buys a gun, such as a TT-type gun.
The gun is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodically carry out control purchases from traders offering illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find each other most often through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone came to my attention and suggested that I come to the Begowaja station, where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The prize for the gun I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have an acquaintance like that, but I don't trust him."
There are merchants in the markets, but there you have to go and arrange with a code like "Ivan Ivanovich, who tells that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even getting some punch rings from a friend I trust at the moment.
He's also giving me the hit rings because he knows I don't rat him out.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album, in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like I was in the luxury store," remembers the military member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, I'm going to the woods with the salesman, and we're setting a target there.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed nor are there any personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the ad on the website "Buy a gun or a rifle".
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless sham websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons are rushing into the web.
People come like hungry fish while feeding and then end up in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through a ATM.
"In response he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also go out empty and get behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless sham websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons are rushing into the web.
"People come like hungry fish while feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
According to experts, the purchase of illegal firearms is expected to cost between US$100 and US$900.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" one can buy a gun of type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military weapons camps by mid-range guards.
According to official statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal arms offences across Russia fell by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives fell by 7.8%.
Fast-food and supermarket workers are on strike in the US
One in four American teenagers sits behind Mc Donald's cash registers
In the past few days, massive protests against low wages have taken place in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell further or whether they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the protest organizers pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
Up to now, this sector of the economy is hardly organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the US, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to crowds of hands.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, stopped their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, struck branches of the chain whose target group are low and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The commodity in Walmart stores is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees only buy in at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests at Black Friday demanded wage increases and expressed their anger at the fact that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raises the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than they are now donating for wages.
If Walmart were to completely transfer the wage increases to the customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
That would be $12.39 a year for them compared to today's additional spending.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that only nine states have protested and that they have not caused any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
All in all, the Walmart casks carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees put down the work and that the protest action was merely "an additional PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where, however, their destination was not Walmart branches (which are not wanted in this advanced city and are therefore so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company is selling billions of servings, and yet you're not being given sick days, and you're not being paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York legislation, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get along with so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the youth still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, during interviews with McDonald's staff, I constantly meet people who complain that they are getting along with this salary and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal's forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks from fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The US law prohibits corporate governance from standing in the way of this goal and from admonishing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate management does not make it easy for them.
The creation of trade unions in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of servings, and yet you're not given sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support the fast food workers so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, by far not all of whom are employed in the fast-food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"Until now, the brain can only be outsmarted moderately"
The subject of expanded reality, popular with followers of modern technologies, is usually perceived in recent times by the lens of special glasses.
First Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
In a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear, however, that the glasses were only a transit station for the company's scientists.
It appeals to the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot of things still take place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We're trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the universal solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform all bystanders about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and scarce gestures rather than extended gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How so?
- We'd ask you, for example, to hand over this bubble can to you?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- Normally, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the time and what can't?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors, which will enable us to capture people's reactions more closely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What requirements do you place on modern cameras based on your work with Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps wouldn't be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X- and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps are too little for gestures in particular.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond laboratory with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction between man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us to determine a position in three-dimensional terms.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public, unlike Google.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the way, but I think the best option would be a "changing" extended reality where we could switch from glasses to smartphones via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and this is their strength (privates can only see you), but also their weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: There is no palpable reaction!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that expanded reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could certainly be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
It perceives pressure perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is at the moment still so weak as someone was blowing over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
Make it think that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be outsmarted moderately, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, have already landed on the exquisite list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, the bearded one dressed in red, who can be seen at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining figure of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s respectively.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street conjures his fellow citizens a smile in the face and creates a good mood with them.
Recently, he grabbed a rotating organ and became a St. Petersburger rotary organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in town, for example?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the grey norm evokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Kulturpalast Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevzhina"; this resulted in "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was finally over.
I am drawn to theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything but literature.
And all of this was united in your art clinic... it was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the bohemian, the house of the Petersburg bohemian until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
String and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys and to them belonged also the today's trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became their "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, but he learned the basics from us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art Clinic.
There our employees and regular guests went.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000 there was a survey in the press, which was about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the "Artists of the Year" category, and that's how I got to the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition entitled "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be like that.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented towards the exterior and not the interior of the human being.
But maybe you can't give a man's hand, but you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the city's rotating organ player.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everybody likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- Stas Michailow's performances come to several thousand!
- There come abandoned women, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I have painted such pictures that hanged in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It's called intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, it's something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
People say servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real Tsars it was different, because the Tsars perhaps did not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some who might be experts, but they are blocked, as higher-ranking experts are needed to evaluate the former properly and clear the way for them.
Now only one's own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg to you?
- Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and an appropriate breeding ground.
On our stones art can hardly grow up.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's a lot less for us.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of St Petersburg
Birth in Space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth dwellers on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, is the important question raised as to how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are no many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypothetically.
"Mars and Venus," says the research assistant at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first dealt with the question of reproduction in space with regard to flora.
Half a century before that, experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the terrestrial species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent to space to investigate how weightlessness affects embryo development.
A normal chick develops.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find a hold; it must be able to stand on its feet and begin to move," explains Vladimir Sychew, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems (RAN).
Without solid ground, the chicks turned wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely dulled.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we had chicks hatched and then set the whole thing up because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew observes for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last incubator with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special has been found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," notes Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could not be solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans could do that in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk of Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Will it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says Raumfahrtveteran Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, Valentina Tereshkova, the first female cosmonaut, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even did work outside the spacecraft, bore a son.
Still, there's a risk.
We only have very few cosmonauts, where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Waleri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro laboratory in the cosmonauts' preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults feel that water is pleasant, it is an alien environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders bear witness that life on the land emanated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the amniotic fluid for about 9 months in the womb of the mother, and that it can get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth until the first swim only two weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
Thus, while weightlessness is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not get along without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles recede enormously quickly and thus the ability to squeeze out the child also decreases.
All right, let's avoid this by birth-inducing aids.
Birth, for example, could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's attraction, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in a stress suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we are undertaking together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely unadapted person," predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes reality when the Earth's inhabitants in their spaceships set out to become a distant planet that becomes home to their all-born offspring.
NKÚ chief: control of the black system fails due to political fault
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in relation to public contracts, but is lagging behind in its application.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case with us," says Kala, commenting on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas towards the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the chairman of the government to come, and the supervisory authority, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, to hinder its activity," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries regarding public contracts were compared.
What was that about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of European legislation determining how public contracts can be handled, based on national legislation, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even more "stricter and perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again. One also has to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project for you?
It is precisely this joint control that could help us stop trying to perfect the laws and reduce and balance thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork" and those looking for gaps in the system have made it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there a similar authority to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is similar to ours and also has a college which is only formed a little differently. However, in principle, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also to some extent comparable, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. there are these audit courts also in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The FRG is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds, which are administered by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the national audit offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare this without any specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the examiners are better there?
I don't think so, but as I said, I don't like making comparisons like that.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us also face problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did the amendment of the public procurement law have for your authority, do you feel any impact?
Given that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an effect on our tests.
Since our checks are carried out retrospectively, we have to expect some delay.
So far, we are more likely to experience effects in the preparation phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control tool "recognition of risks of inefficiency" and with this nearly 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed - here the changes will naturally have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational regional policy programme, the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the public procurement law is equivalent to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let us say which way is not a good one.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now prohibited or permitted?
A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the chairman of the government to come and the supervisory authority, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, to hinder its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he can't say that we act as if nothing were there.
The public procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid is excluded solely because of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I believe is missing.
On the roads there are some ice smoothness, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice smoothing.
However, most of the roads are easily accessible, sometimes with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary the roads were well accessible this morning, occasionally snow and ice smoothing prevailed.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges on which the roads are sometimes icy and smooth.
All roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, some icy or excavated snow remains.
Increased attention is therefore needed, especially in the higher altitudes.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads of East Bohemia there is danger due to ice smoothness, in higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes still a snow layer on the roads, the road and highway direction on their Internet pages.
Most roads warn riders of ice smoothing, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smoothing can occur especially on roads of the second and third class in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is located especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely free of precipitation.
Temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen district
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now easily accessible, but local attention is needed, and the driving method is adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it snowed before and the temperatures fell afterwards, ice smoothing can occur on the streets.
Fogs are also to be expected locally, but the visibility will improve during the day.
This information comes from the district highways.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but the main roads recommend increased attention between the 80th and 131th kilometers.
The roads of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice smoothing can occur.
The roadways of the second and third class of roads are wet, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the area of Böhmerwald.
Olomouc district
Today, people who are heading towards altitudes in the Olomouc district have to reckon with snow mud.
After the use of scattered vehicles, there is still a lot of snow on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow-driving forced the roads to be used, in Šumperk County about 3 cm of fresh snow fell, according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are mostly fully accessible.
"In Šumperk County, snow remains at altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, the drivers have to count on snow mud towards Jeseník," said an employee of the Šumperk Road Administration to ČTK today.
Also her colleagues in the Jeseník district had to leave at night, according to their information the roads are free and wet up to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc the roads are fully accessible, but in Šternberk the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, because the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In northern Bohemia, the main roads report several poorly accessible sections of the road.
The road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí n.K., according to the traffic police, is closed in addition to several places with snow or ice smoothing.
The temperatures remain below zero even in deeper locations, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads. However, no problems are reported from the lowlands, especially south-east of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic jams have been reported so far.
Ice smoothing is reported in particular from the area around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, during the night there were ideal conditions - during the day rain and melting snow, during the night cloudless sky and frost.
Poor traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from the I/13 road at the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice was blocked due to branches that were pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world taking place in less than a month?
This is one of those reports of disasters that we humans so much like to start on.
With our band The Tap Tap we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It's a nationwide benefit event that we've been planning for two years.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously from 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is said to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a time zone 12 hours before us.
Who made this idea?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we not only want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once handed this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keyrings against the end of the world, with the purchase of which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "Doomsday falls out".
The anthem on YouTube is already very popular today. Will it also be heard on the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and that the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live together in a direct connection from Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, and Xindl X also sings with ...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is due to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We try to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most of us are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, which we have been working on for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built in which we move into with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What criteria did you choose to use?
We wanted to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform.
You can find out everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be carried in the luggage compartment. Furthermore, of course, we have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of how it looks in each country with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we have witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is absolutely not barrier-free. It is still unusual there if someone is in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even self-evident there that you let a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still hanging out on...
It should be noted, however, that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not very common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in the social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in engaging with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, I founded a music group together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Láća Angelovič, used to say, it's a little out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if one does something and this cannot be seen externally, one's own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good reviewers, high-quality equipment, etc.
Was it your goal to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I've felt the potential that you can do things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
Of course, the first impression the viewer usually has is compassion; that's only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not just a step forward for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and must also demand a certain discipline.
However, I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and when they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, that they have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm disappears quickly with many.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láća Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.

Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the Space Agency at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency. Poland is the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's way into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts occupied themselves with space travel, but they did not always come across understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to cosmonautism".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, which was donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "Entrance to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the face of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the Draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research was conducted by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents handed down that research had reached the stage of practical testing.
Of course, the research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a photoelectric fighter rocket appeared in the specialist press of the design by Ing. Rohozinski, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was terminated at the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of the Society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space society.
At the time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was foreseeable that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the International Federation of Spacecraft, which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation of Spacecraft.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first start took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests with the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Błędów Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was discontinued.
The first RM rocket was replaced by the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and its take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 liters capacity, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight altitude for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the law on charitable work.
This decision led to a lively public discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Because of the large differences in the value of labour (wages), price tensions occur.
This term refers to a state in which the producer tries to maintain economic competition by importing cheap goods by "undercutting" competition in order to gain a greater market share and to increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies moving their production abroad or buying cheaply there, or abandoning their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparablely high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they cause to society as a whole.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments spend their own population on private capital regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the wage sector.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion with long-term unemployment, and on the other by curtailing workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, for some years now, there have been public food delivery centres for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases where employees receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to a minimum.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU's southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in their social levels, or to spend a hunger wage on the margins of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
Here, naturally, the question arises as to where this capital comes from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or capital remains completely out, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa, employees work for a fraction of Europe's wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim, to the extent that the state is not allowed to participate in its own economy with capital, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists narrowly on its view that the state should not intervene in the economy in a direct way.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful lobby that is ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual preference, of legislation in which virtually everything is grievous, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a Ministry of State, in the absence of finance, commissions private legal entities closely linked to industry to draft legislation.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer originates from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in Caesar's and Pompeius' times: "The state has long been in disintegration, and the offices have been occupied by force.
Against bribery, through unlawful concealment of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption was rampant, and the people went to the polls with already bought voices" ... "People with character did not apply for office, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "One really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected" ... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with the sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as well as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital, by its very nature, is not in a position to recognise and enforce the benefit for the whole of society.
The result, both now and then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who are not seeking deeper reforms in the least.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already taking place.
It is particularly catastrophic that today's elites face in complete ignorance the possible future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from older and newer history.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's capital participation in the economy, increase citizens' influence on government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...so that we don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want war, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, countless reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is in these recurring waves of culprits and victims; in the end, today's inhabitants of Israel, including self-government areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It's about opening the reader's eyes behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot of land in the Middle East is primarily useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must acknowledge that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out especially, which could be called the head of the octopus (I don't know if anyone is standing above them, but I don't rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century, in order to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in whose background always stood the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in central banks they wage wars or prepare for them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi only four remained, with Russia in the meantime subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own banknotes during the civil war, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the Rothschild's global desire for power led to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Spak, a Mason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Britain in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their convenience and luxury and would not consume so much resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism here is nothing more than the advance) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that crises such as those they triggered in 1907 do not repeat).
After having succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of Ferdinand the Habsburg heir to the throne in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to make the Second World War easier to spark, the bankers had a latent conflict situation created by politics, by placing Germany with gigantic war reparations; thus they created the precondition of impoverished masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilty ones named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take on the function of a fifth column and also took on the role of ignite in the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, possibly in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke away from the chain on which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the precondition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the land was prepared for the Second World War by the war reparations against Germany, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be victims in the front line of the war, like in the Second World War, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just remember how sharply people divide themselves into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israel, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
One has to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, since the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, exclusively put their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-prone politician loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything he can to spark a war with Iran, which could rapidly expand to a global conflict in view of Iran's membership of the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...) and which could result in the destruction of the world economy because of Iran's control over the two-mile-wide Strait of Hormus, over which 20% of world oil supplies run.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocratics.
A world in which every newborn child is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the bondmen all to give themselves a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whoever has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had maintained the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have severely damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to free hostages made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity - they traveled disguised with Canadian passports as members of a film staff allegedly visiting film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan, developed by the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the camouflage credible, articles on this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This alters the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no big differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits at the meeting table, on the floor, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable re-launch of his career.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime thriller No children's play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the initial sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong film stick on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few he works quite successfully, whereby he sometimes helps the reality - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes, in which the imminent crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted from a telephone call in America, or also the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its over-wide dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film loses some traction. It's a film that you can follow with some interest, and you can goout the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive in a certain way to this day and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of the almighty and omniscient secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which publishes an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to organise the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"The EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% female quota in the management of large European companies brought us on this idea," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the European Court of Justice ruling on the harmonisation of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013,' said Nacher.
One of the controversial EU regulations is the mandatory incorporation of bioethanol into fuels which, as a result, are damaging to nature, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism was also reaped by the actual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on selling conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member states (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonises the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU has already softened the standards on fruit and vegetables against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the existing directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to balloons must be indicated when selling, that children under the age of eight must not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU relied on an American study that according to balloons is the leading cause of children's suffocation death.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairground tortoises.
Curious ideas are also at home
A directive that concerns European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated the above-mentioned absurdities as well as the EU regulation on the scope of food stocks in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum amount of food stocks that could be found on the Czech Republic's territory on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for preserved mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
Of course, these ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU", said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission came to the point where the Czech Republic organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered funding for applications for funding to the municipalities, specifically for the placement of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, some experts believe that while regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserves more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing at all in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by individual Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions also evokes in this country the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
The Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, the national centre (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or the Parma ham now includes the Karlovy Vary Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saaz hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic gingerbread or Hořicer rolls can boast.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic being plundered for 20 years, the thieves running around freely, while people are being increased taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I'm over 40, independent and non-partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then set off for the castle.
Don't you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to start the battle for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would be running for President if I were elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as people, scold in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we put down everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media who want to rob you of honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the battle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective declarations of assets of more than 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How are you going to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have campaigned to ensure that the guidebook remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-party, I have far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogmas, I can take from each party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people tend to see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we move forward.
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like anyone calling you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you'd like to approach this one.
We can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will only have keywords.
And you will not get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will be able, for example, to enforce material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public to try to put them on our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors by law.
And if so, the addressees would have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that points to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and try to find support for my programme by the majority.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything on my own, so I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to run for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I began my candidacy with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the electorate did not go to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district heads.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to review the past of any potential party member, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there is only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about wealth statements, what would yours look like?
I estimate my personal wealth at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million, and then I have a few million on my account.
Incidentally, Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked how he drove in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don't have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program doesn't seem to attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If only I wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to have your livelihood?
Didn't you say you were going to go back to these activities?
But that's not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I partially returned my activities.
For example, my deputy becomes managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want me to be a Samaritan to save the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
Which monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that remains the case.
As President, however, I would completely discontinue my activities.
You will find the full talk in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Buchenberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of those old-style libraries on their own today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town that is hardly to be visited at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest rate of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro notes as nicely pinned reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of the bold bar charts and producer of funny, even cynical buildings, took the matter with usual serenity and appeared at the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury was still dazzling and looking around and twitching with the armpits, the cheeky Maas piled up his exquisite souvenirs of size to a pyramid and ended his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear town community!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is piled up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Buchenberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This makes the faceless small town resort, which up to now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bücheldorado under cheese bell.
There is indeed a lift that leads through the mountain massif, but the true pleasures of space and reading open up when climbing the topography on foot.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak the language of a public city square unequivocally.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally, the bookshelfs stand along the façade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and pushed the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Buchenberg is cleverly used: offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and building technology center are located in the center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelfs, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stairs railings.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even incarnate architects and civil engineers shake their heads about the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, upon request of the standard.
And so one day, in a Frisian farm, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in the Netherlands, greenhouses and fields have used a millimeter-thin plastic fleece as root substrate.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ready for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material, which smells a bit of new cars and a bit of sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long walk you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and stuffed ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology despite the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
Heat and cool with geothermal heat.
Although the Buchenberg is under a glass fall, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly inside.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass facade, serve as shading and absorb a large part of the solar radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest are done by fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT industry, already dared to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg Spijkenisses "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the supreme discipline that is called in the jargon of identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany has to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
That's because it's just surrounding its foreign policy, away from a policy that has been managed, so to speak, by the US, to a German foreign policy.
What is more, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still touching on their role, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude of the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful not to throw the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
It certainly matters.
But I wouldn't want to put too much weight on it either, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that as an international player it must be taken seriously and its interests taken into consideration.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly voted in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans know that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still finding it difficult to lead?
Germany is not used to it yet, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a larger role, a variety of anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
This is how Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be receptive to various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European politics is steadily diminishing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum right now, who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and make them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Markenschutz" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
There is an officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to register their brands.
So Gucci becomes simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada one lets Prada-Kny enter.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the Zegna DF Puma trademark protected there, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injured intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively forgeries.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he is against the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai", a passenger badge.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
That means women fishing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"It's business-damaging, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods with a volume of 15 billion euros per year and the fastest growing market.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can take place, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court dismissed actions because after the long duration of the contested name had become "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he must even pay the plagiarist money because he violated his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admitted that there had been bottlenecks in 2010 due to too little staff and space.
Last year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the course of work to normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still awaiting completion in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As is so often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is leading the list of new registrations around the world, the agency reports.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected in fees.
Simplified means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle this costs a multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal fabrication of imitated vehicle parts was lifted.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
One had failed to do so, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Executive Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO rejected the Munich opposition.
Freudenberg was right in the next two instances, but the opponent continues to fight today.
You have to watch the hell out
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the dishes.
But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, that the company archive even had to look through a hundred years old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement in vain.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to slip back to Europe.
Then, when imitators secure unprotected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business segment, yet it was able to avert registration.
"You have to watch the hell out," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights; rather, foreigners should also register in China "everything that is somehow worth protecting," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was in the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the opposite side royalties for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - press, beguile and follow each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it from his fabric shoes when he brings it together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and this is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, according to Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found godparents in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser on Zulu.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room no one can, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and bringing them back from time to time to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esiteni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, we can see in a small way what all of Swaziland suffers from: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune deficiency virus, dying in mid-30s is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
If you don't graduate from school, you don't have a chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal a day.
But already a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which since then almost professionally takes care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmissible Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhoea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human pappilomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabs belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and Tripper are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, Chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (fungal), tripper and human pappilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is comparatively low in this country - yet this group accounts for around 20 percent of new HIV infections.
In adolescents, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In this country, human pappilomaviruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been falling since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and tight body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Most STIs can be cured early on and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the gigs that the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"Overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esiteni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans stay well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, put a roof over their heads and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms every day on time for school lessons.
If you don't have anyone else, you'll come to the shelter at Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, it is best to keep it quiet.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's about sexuality."
Strange, actually, in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers carrying the virus through the country.
Free condoms exist on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels through the South of Africa together every two or three years and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many at the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much appreciation not only brings mood and joy, but has already defecated some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esiteni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esiteni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometres as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there as well.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as three studies published in the journal "Science" on Thursday show.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently in the shadowed region of the planet.
It should be at least 30 centimeters thick and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one brings the discovery of ice but related to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth citizens, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: small peepholes in infinite widths.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars can be recognized as blue dots, the pink "newborns" in the Sternenkreissaal are harder to identify.
This star-forming region - called by scientists unromantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star image Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has captured the Nasa Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star hurled out in the process of death.
In the giant Trifid nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
The Nasa Spitzer Telescope shot this photo of the Galactic Birthplace.
The Pleiades Star Cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors come to the fore better.
Like a red age, the Helix nebula looks towards the viewer in this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius star image.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent gave this fog the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloration.

One of the largest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The photo published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tripartite, tripartite), as dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star-birth place.
In the constellation snake bearers, astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carambol: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't have technical abbreviations, you may call them Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows an excerpt from the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away nebula consists of dust grains ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, received the Hubble Space Telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new youngsters.
Also this star cloud, connected to the rosette nebula, constantly produces new baby stars - 5000 light-years from the Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it only emerged shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our Insights into Space: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later for star observation.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is lashed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high light collection force.
In spite of relatively small mirror diameters, this range is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is the Very Large Telescope, which honors its name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should comprise a rich 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF next to them.
Also on Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the Hubble Space Telescope provides the most important impressions from space.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates have been identified since the mission began.
In the picture the last start preparations are documented at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messengers circle around the planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
The scientists now have certainty through the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to circle around Mercury.
Drink butter every day - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible - high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible - high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very durable.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town is bursting with Soviet architecture, which doesn't want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the journey from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to attract tourists.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here the vita of about eight dozen talyshes from the area is documented, the older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years still a child begotten
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person, who became 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely dubious.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have fathered another daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov account for a few decades at his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also strikingly many high-aged people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "and in Sardinia, too, there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to a lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age was to be provided, especially as civil status registers were missing.
Melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik are remarkably often of biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is the diet.
But that the calorie-rich diet of the Talyschen should be so healthy, that they love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view either.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik.
At the age of 97 she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter keg that she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Also two toddlers jump around.
In the kitchen you can prepare tea, which is served in the typical, bell-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in line, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always only ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven't bought groceries at the supermarket once.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst after World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rudder.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old.
230 Manat (about the same sum in euros) receives Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grey son is right: "The old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as a base is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of graces of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
According to Mohammed Morsi, he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be deprived?
In fact, the 234 articles that have been flogged by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly 15-hour parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is an interpretative matter and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the accompanying legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least a new article: In all Sharia-related matters, Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it can mean that the clergy are supervising legislation, which would de facto lead to the disintegration of the judiciary.
Much of the draft text is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: Civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress oppositionists.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, as it stands in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and values".
This is so vaguely formulated in legal terms that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering Prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Just as dubious is the phrase that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Is there enough caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
The question of interpretation, such as so much in the draft that Mursi has signed, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday evening on Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter down before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft Constitution belongs "to the garbage mountain of history".
Via short news service Twitter, he accused Mursis of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the area demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafists participated and shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi: "Purge the land!" and affirmed: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, in which everything began, would probably have conjured up civil war-like conditions.
That was obviously not what Mursi's followers wanted to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the advocates had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists' draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their views on the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state led the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto repealed it," Saeda laments.
But democracy could not work without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns, "You're feeding a monster you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst-smelling fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty bad-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, wet sports clothes.
And leave her there for a week.
One must imagine the nasal anaesthetic smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-scattered trout, which - depending on how stinking one would like its fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk General".
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can suppress the smell.
I'll taste some snacks.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near your nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has a long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era when there were no cooling options and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter it was then taken out after long fermentation and consumed - no doubt with the help of alcohol-muffled senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too long ago far richer than Norway, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - an essential, though strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here you still hate to name Anders Breivik - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "event of July 22."
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, growth has been one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the piercing blue eyes.
We are - as they say - a prudent people.
Your English is spotless just like most people here.
We're not very bragging, we don't like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the world economic crisis, when everyone threw money around, which they didn't have at all, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand up for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
A moose burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening, the stinky fish is back on the menu.
The hotel where I logy is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which blocks several important traffic routes to the capital and creates chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Presidential Union and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Mexico has proven itself economically well under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Pena Nieto served as the governor of his home state, Mexico, before moving on to the same level with the US president.
In this densely populated, expansive part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A Direct Man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and sustained changes," said his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and the economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition's allegations that the new president lacks substance.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was engaged to combat drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a spot of wasteland near a large landfill.
During Governor Pena Nieto's term of office, over 1,000 women were murdered in the State of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of women's murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government had closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, her body seemed to have been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the rigors had already started.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has so far been denied to her.
The authorities treated me like I was a chatter, troublemaker, nörgler.
They want their judgment to be accepted and their mouth shut up.
"But that's not possible if there were so many formal mistakes and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the Presidential Bond on Saturday, he takes on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is the way he was governor," said Pri Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of this.
The prosecution claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutor's office contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the charge on the basis of harsh detention conditions
The U.S. Army Private is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor's office tried to find out that army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in US history - failed to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that there was no complaint about his treatment at any of the weekly visits to Manning's prison officials during their nine-month term in Quantico, Virginia.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to dismiss the prosecution - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard detention period - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the Friday hearing, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he had served under increased detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as "very professional".
According to Fein, the forms did not contain any complaints about abuse, even though officers had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had spoken orally about his concerns and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they had to deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down "No problems" (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the thoughts of suicide he had mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to the "prevention of injuries".
The military testified that it had assigned him this restrictive status - one stage under the risk of suicide - to his and others' protection.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious due to the heat.
Not being allowed to know what was happening to him or to the outside world was incriminating.
"My world shrunk to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving, because the day was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He had always had to sleep with light that entered his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn't see his face anymore, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's attorney formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Military Prison.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
During the Friday questioning, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He would have tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the band of his underpants or flip flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and drastically reduce his detention if he is sentenced to trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offenses, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the detention conditions.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the regulations applicable to all prisoners under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
Indictments against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all counts, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at passport control when perplexity spread in me.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called Mexican all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I chose Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and queued up for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda there were all the issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico's war against drug cartels, even though he did not give any details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership to give them more than half of their territory, with a rifle held in hand.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how the Americans oppress the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath.
And yet Mexico's biggest challenge lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents part - was offered no chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person was in line with a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and we are faithful to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now have lived the American dream, visited good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurred at times, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership don't like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our gang to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans resent them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they are neither one nor the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted in them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and sections of the educational bourgeoisie want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We are supposed to tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and to put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have resentment for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were struck.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this confusion.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the fatal stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, these weeks of fighting have strengthened the hard-pocketed on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its group itself suffered great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are forced into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent, regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has seized the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Thrilling Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist half-moon is formed around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has the power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist coinage could stand before Bashar Assad's fall, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And especially the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the strongest and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas is fraternized and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved its worth and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remains steadfast in its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers, not least thanks to the blockades that have gone into the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal to international law, but are being further expanded.
Netanyahu is well standing there. His Likud party joined forces with an even more militant group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians also haggle and leave their own state to them?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, wouldn't they, like their comrades in the Gaza Strip, also fire rockets?
No, it's better to keep them in check and punish them behind the wall if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab Spring could put a dash through their heads.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi joined forces with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think in the longer term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to suppress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly take its diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is the one represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel withdraws territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop the supply of weapons to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must play its part in encouraging Israel to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems that he is also averse to participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, Saturday will be the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small fonts.
Thus Australia introduces the world's most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian government wants to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
In doing so, the government assumes studies that have shown that people who haven't started smoking at 26 will not start with a 99% probability even after that.
"You can see from children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to apply with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, two months ago, failed at the Australian Supreme Court to challenge the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media is precisely the population to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most traders to stop selling cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Anyone who markets tobacco and has only one small area left to apply for their products does not get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted an increase in experience reports on brands written by "normal people".
You have to ask yourself the question: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of focusing on marketing, industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
In fact, it has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries trade more with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring her.
"You just take a tip and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging made it difficult to refill his shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort a shipment, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said to ourselves okay, that's it, we shut down," he adds visibly angryly.
In a constantly electrified world it's nice to be bored sometimes
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and children's development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen nowadays, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that one more time.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfactory job but not being able to do it".
Boredom is therefore different from apathy in that the person is not busy, but this wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists of a "disturbation of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing away".
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in English, for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom under the Aspect of Attention", which appeared in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
Those who heard the hardly audible television reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could find no reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult or exhausting task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if one does a monotonous job - "like the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that paunching and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a roaring speaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored easier than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom susceptibility" in the 1980s.
On the scale are statements such as "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather strained bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and did their homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were not at school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom have increased or decreased.
He was sure, however, that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling prey to gambling or drugs to relieve them - that's what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, while television can provide happiness in the short term, it evaporates in the long term.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, you can turn it away from boredom. However, it has not learned to talk or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, "Self-control transfers from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we view them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even outside of the constant growth in activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the agonizing, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to shut down and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with once the noise is silent."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for an offense in Southeastern Colorado, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few marijuana skirts and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, on a September day, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug supplies - cavalier crimes, each with a fine of 100 US dollars - and received a court meeting.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of minor drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misconduct about marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana needle schemes and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so fast that I don't even know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is, in any case, ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington City Spirits Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on December 6th, making it the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how to agree on the state's requirement for "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis shops around 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor Marihuanadelikte among persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would "from now on" no longer seek criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate the cultivation of medicinal marijuana and continue to persecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a tougher view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to persuade consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 people have to answer to court for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were committed at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
Even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, the reactions are ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer indicate adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the very beginning that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the state led to a profound disparity among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendant for Marihuanadelikte in court and is a local spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for still not being able to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller quantities of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national model cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several sensational arrests of consumers and salesmen of medical marijuana, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama administration, believes that although detectives are unlikely to enter doors to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana operations under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums for new marijuana stores, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided to ban it for six months, which is likely to be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We depend on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
It's always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once thought was the greatest stamp of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposion that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my move to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson mischievously explained that I had left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been harassed for only one reason - a reason that seemed to be all the more narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my father Woodrow Wyatt, who had died in the meantime, was an important advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate right-wing students are suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for equal equality protection, which benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College state that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" due to their political views.
They demand a place in their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was aggravated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which featured Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and bragged with a silver suit and silver-set walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are regarded as "sin-goats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, reported in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing tendency to turn left at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, said that she had observed a growing rejection of JCR members against moderate right-wing students.
"This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was a member of such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to grant an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher, a former student, due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have made Stalinists startle.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what will happen in the future.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even took part with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled on it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty ugly.
"Do Thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
My eyes were filled with tears.
"I suggest they take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt told me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That night, I was sitting alone in college at dinner when someone tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory will be harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be a Labour party supporter.
In a local pub, I later tried to disguise myself.
I insisted that I didn't agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically attended the conservative Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How did Torie have sex?" one asked me.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that were ahead of me stretched in front of my spiritual eye to a purgatory of banishment and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and pettyly and rejected it for his Marxist-Deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' home and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do that, not in my city of dreaming towertops.
Even my communist friends have always displayed perfect manners.
His wet eyes were clouded.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're just being teased.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also Tory followers, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another historical tutor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly crushed with shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwash" and called it "old morons".
The relief lasted only a short while.
It was my father who nailed the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a whiny limp dick.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 haute couture dresses were put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stuffy and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3, there will be a large number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick their dicks out on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, at the food and at the music one recognized and felt his influence.
"All those invited felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that began her career at the 1995 Haute Couture Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion Show of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good upbringing and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60 meter long catwalk that proposes a roll change: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte" or a wool and leather coat belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls shine names like that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the ex- duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget for the first time when she was wearing a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came about.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped bodice with a décolleté that makes his name honor.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg preserves her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite clouded, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, Garavani cumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I've always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stony paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the steep paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the worn-out carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb in the tortoise speed, keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulphur they deplete.
When they arrive at the top, they find their way between the tourists, who take pictures like circus monkeys, and run three kilometers to the scales with the tiresome heavy baskets, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 exploits the deposits in the volcano and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely finished, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an almost inhumane effort, however, is three times what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest pays 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason as important as sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at risk at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left its first mark on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work here for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-stricken young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders at the bottom of the crater.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid for by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera, which the guardians of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human tragedies.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are trapped in the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with his 53 years is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur out of the volcano, transported by three trucks across a goat path between the bushes to the Tamansari camp, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulfur carrier at the age of 30.
Time is passing, but poverty is stopping generation on generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human vices on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame the fact that they have no children, on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfil our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mints, but nevertheless - or precisely because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "Jeaving a bao" (laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has shot the video, preserves the hope that the commercial reaches in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to replanting, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic that we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we make something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in south-east Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Agency, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have much more options in terms of life goals and priorities besides getting married and making a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single persons and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely disguised xenophobia is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the Singapore example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoeboxes" that may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person and that they deter construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoeboxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards provide clearer guidance to developers who had previously been put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, discussions with the Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will not have a major impact.
"People are very stressed out, the apartments and the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses when he exposes himself to situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" at the personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't publish in a post," says ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, nudes, crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures me that he has 35 friends in FB and nine in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone had a stranger in mind, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has hinted at him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone pushes me or asks me to do so, I just remove it from my user account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim didn't close the account.
"He just did it in private."
He then explains a number of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if I didn't like him or if I wanted to get rid of him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and young people, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information, but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University, and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We're the digital immigrants they're supposed to teach when we're still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what can be spread, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be picky when it's most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell you not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions a few ways: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of yourself, like the one you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educator, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shall not speak to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources at the State and President Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the exam, but then explained that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content of the statement was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the image of the Presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among journalists was received from the press speakers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
After that, Peru's presidency sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was Humala's statement and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced before, was not published in spite of a strong press call.
On the official ASPA website, you can see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were in place, but they limited access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the trial Lima initiated against Santiago to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the ruling on the differences that we are currently bringing to this international court," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that abides by international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," Piñera added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
Both Presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH, after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The Head of State read out the final document stating that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for an investment total of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
He stated that action would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant features, but should serve to expand our production output and to show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve spatial links in South America, especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians, located on the transverse axes of their territory from the coast to Brazil, and of which two should provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was stressed at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, in order to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua will also make talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Block's defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru presides at the time of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn how to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually learning something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans were "killed in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and that "today they are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that will drive the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and financed by the United States," he said as an allusion to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there were "reasonable assumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his proceedings would not be complied with."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish justice allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out through the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be affected.
"Since he was in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he would take physical and mental damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European legal authorities. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings at various European institutions," he said.
And "if Britain grants this license tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype, as the Swedish case law allows and in other cases was done, the problem would be resolved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, evil intention, and the lie that defies freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador for not being dominated by such journalists "and not by bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that, in re-election, "he would deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not allow opportunism and no coup d'état disguised as legal" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, to be "absolutely entitled."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion to the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international authorities if both countries commit themselves to accept the judgment, even if it is very harsh."
With regard to the possibility that he would stand as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador in order to reach his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to live up to this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today took part in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, which ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of dying because of AIDS is a too late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he got the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "weaken" without discernible success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know about their illness and who have already caused damage to the virus and exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient taking up treatment in good time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of HCG's HIV unit, saying that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 the scientists have concluded that although AIDS is not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the beginning of the treatment, and that those who are not addicted to drugs have greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above remarks mean that those who receive HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can "be 75 years of age without problems as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report), it is true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60% of the patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that universal access to antiretroviral medicines has been available since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no medical care problems. The problem is that people are in a very advanced state because they don't know their state of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. To be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is required, which is why all persons who require this must be offered massive detection tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out in a private laboratory, for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, it's better to burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was for improvement, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio points out, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the global AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Adolescents are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need them for?" is a widespread ridicule question by social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and the health care system, which young people do not want to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be located behind the counter, but also in output devices in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They are not to be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is in fourth place nationally in new and cumulated AIDS cases, and 13th in relation to HIV.
92% of contagion is caused by sexual intercourse, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the Court of Appeal of the United States has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which has been reached through a commercial exchange rate in Mexico, an ominous precedent will be created for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the Northern District in Texas results in Mexican companies being helplessly exposed to confiscation of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all states that the main proceedings are the commercial exchange rate dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for the insolvency of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was established, with the American Law Institute being used as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the assets of the Vitro branches with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Prices).
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family appeals to the same Court of Appeal in order for the vote to take place in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare appeal, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, is brought in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious thing about this case is that the court dismissed a document sent by the Mexican Government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) describing the proceedings carried out by Vitro under the Trade Concourse Act, pointing out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules on cases of cross-border insolvency which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance
After the announcements by the Mexican air transport unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, failed for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Arbeitsschaftsverband der Piloten) has finally made progress.
The request by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal case against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of impeding justice.
After that, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the central administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from Bank IXE's F/589 trustee account to the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used to acquire shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a Forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the Wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has reached the point of uniting the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental institution, which partly destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has not been complied with, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken despite the fact that the Senate had disregarded the possibility of considering them as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In the quest to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex launches stock exchange certificates of over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and travelled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for six years, whether as a player of lower classes, a player of the first national league, an agent and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"I've spent my life putting on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as a co-manager or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years I've enjoyed the most because I've been part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as managing director, co-manager or coach.
They were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who allowed himself to become a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember he said that if Mincy had made Bayamon a championship, Gausse would take care of another one.
He was awarded the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, if it hadn't been this Canadian referee who let us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were there again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated this level like Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the bandage?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, told her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He gave pleasure to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray explained in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he was undergoing a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Wonderful Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also the actor of two comedies, which were only broadcast for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film works included roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors" that were well-evaluated by critics.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's character was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in betting houses.
The series thus reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who shot J.R.'s sister-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had pregnant her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) admitted.
"I know what to say on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should read "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and remains in our hearts preserved by those who were fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcasted with great success on TNT a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just filmed, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how Hagmann's loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theaters in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the air force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I believed could harm or affect someone in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he volunteered for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and after," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Every week the students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long reverse counting" on December 21st, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have referred to as "Deudallaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyses what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, the attending professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week the students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a visiting professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World".
"We're not taking in 2012 so that we can always keep the option of reversing the course in case the world doesn't go down," said Restall.
Despite the "prerequisite demise", students must study, draw up projects and take part in final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night when the world is supposedly coming to an end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no more seats in two hours," Restall said about his high-average course for students who filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a question of consolation or its absence.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less a professor - explained that they believed in the last date of December 21st.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"People don't think that way elsewhere," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know there a course on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said that they want to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
