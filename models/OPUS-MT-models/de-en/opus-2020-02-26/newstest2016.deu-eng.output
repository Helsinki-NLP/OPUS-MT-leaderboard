Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
They wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
The meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement building and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The deal for the Iranian nuclear program promoted by Obama has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu had given a controversial speech before the US Congress, which was sometimes regarded as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, but a meeting had rejected it with reference to the upcoming election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This, according to the authorities, was in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that.
There was another death until the end of the day: Lamb took his life when the police encircled him.
One day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons, saying that he had some health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, the police found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
He was the swarm of women back then.
All the girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the distress call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played one gig or the other together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight commemoration ceremony on the Delta State Campus in Cleveland.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss his wife, but there is no indication that they have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that there won't be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give his current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country. In the 2014 Christmas season, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawn and a arm length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "unquestionably the biggest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five-year-long conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN leader once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the USA, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - on the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in addressing the crisis in Syria in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 polls that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump to lead in the double-digit range, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to Herman Cain at the time, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey figures that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity figures have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enjoyed" or "satisfied" when Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they're "annoyed" if he's the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent saying the same about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "annoyed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same is true in the nation's first primacy state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temper does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, after a survey by CNN/ORC last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This has been a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination as opposed to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed across more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll by the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their opinion.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their minds.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispanics away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to do the same.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for around half of the support of Republican voters, mainly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post's new Monday survey, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry with Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa republicans are frustrated about Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea watt.
In the street, one square meter of a reed roof house costs on average 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers one square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top places of residence, however, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros of nothing - per square meter, mind you.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is for once not at the top.
Champions League: Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goal scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan".
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start in series is to be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
Müller received good help from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto in his 28th match in the Champions League for the Bayern leadership, who let a shot of the world champion, thought of as a flank, pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavarian captain Philipp Lahm promised before the match at the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich fans kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class, including against prestigious clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also stumbled here.
But the Bavarians, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously took action, but in their offensive efforts they often worked too unintentionally.
The attacks were too often triggered by a game shift on left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against former Brunswick Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank hit from the right half field in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit Poland's headball off the line (26th).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto parried with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians played their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put pinsticks.
However, Manuel Neuer was reliable on goalkeepers.
For example, when he directed a shot from Ideye over the latte (56.).
Before Newer Guardiola had a chain of four defended with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which did well.
Mario Götze, back in the cadre after muscular problems, sat outside first.
The World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, that is already malicious".
Guardiola also made his first move against him when he won Kingsley Coman for Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, Müller put one on it by penalty.
Before the match there had been riots in the stadium.
After a small group of partly muted Bayern fans had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures in their viewer block, the security forces intervened and took action against the Munich supporters with batons.
At least one Bayern fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
If you smoke, it not only harms your lungs, but also your teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news is that if you don't give up, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely by 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The association between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent inflammation of the gums in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to return to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, study leader Heiner Boeing from DIfE explained: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Non-smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study corroborated the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remnants from the Late Antiquity on the banks of Cologne's Rhine
For the time being, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic Museum dug up skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called "ground monuments".
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always consulted as a specialist office for archaeological preservation of monuments.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine boulevard the archaeologists were found.
From text documents it had already been known that there was a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman has been killed at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police are asking the people for help.
In the early Wednesday morning around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks coming from the station building at the end of the platform and was covered by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, according to the Federal Police, it has sustained the most serious injuries.
She was medically treated on the spot and taken to a hospital by rescue staff.
No information is available to the investigating officials about the reason for the young woman's nocturnal crossing of the track.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or local residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Local residents or passers-by from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information about the cause of the accident can be provided by telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police department at around the clock, free of charge, to the Federal Police.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To resolve the dispute over the planned Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement (TTIP), the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which, in its functioning, corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is designed to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come equally from the EU, the US and third countries.
A second instance is planned for the first time.
It would allow appeals against judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months it had become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it claims to want to work towards an International Investment Court.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved there.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS), which are mainly demanded by large corporations, are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can dispute damages against taxpayers, eliminate national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German Secretary of State Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had prepared with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned against restricting the scope for action by the business community by means of too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) agreement could be concluded, they remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer considered to be durable.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Prime Club in Cologne (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost seized by Steven's lecture.
He tells about his meticulously and delicately arranged songs by means of various places, which he draws on the map over and over again.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his home country.
Ever since, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative lunatic.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" cleverly composed songs appear, which blend harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" is the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine "Seven Swans" has appeared and breaks positive certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live guitar and banjo are enough for him.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the show.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a masterpiece is published in 2005.
Excessive of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensively electronic offsets.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and reverb.
Long ago the stage shows emerged from the smaller clubs, here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark kept Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the theater "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who has become more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without addressing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture is "opulent" and one can "throw away the record in essence".
Stevens only thanks modestly for an encore, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows down under a roaring applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and to join David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after noon, and his performance will probably be examined by the media and by the Labour MPs at close range.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as she will come after his appointment as a shadow cabinet member and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour Chairman's decision to remain silent during a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he had been "in respectful silence" and that he had recognized the "heroedom of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are "stacking" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman to face David Cameron, who has been head of Tory for the past decade, across the dispatch box in Parliament.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "slaughter" and barbarous arguments and instead intends to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Minister of Economic Affairs, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also talked about the idea that other colleagues would speak on occasion, and that he had addressed John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a cartoon and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Cast in Joburg': Homeless young people trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a tough place when you're homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living with it.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose by leaps and bounds according to data indicating an increase in the UK's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, net of bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and best estimate since 2009 of the timing of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and had climbed to € 1,3730 up to 0.84% against the euro.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49 % to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the acquisition offer of rival AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher according to encouraging news from the competitor group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - reported growth again.
Glencore shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said that he had won $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had "sold" his assessment for the company rating.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The CEO of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappish 21 years young, a chicken with an over-the-top frieze.
The guy with the platinum blond hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More like more.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going crazy.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the Polish has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live idol, whose poster hangs up in Szczecin, since Monday night.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much a day as her mama Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to be in the tenth grade of high school."
"I'm fulfilling her dream."
Compulsory schooling?
Who cares?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertisement in the commercial break of the Superbowl he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and walks over the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're amazed at the window window.
He's said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others point out that Bieber is in first place with his new single "What do you mean?" in the U.S. and UK.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least that's what he's doing.
Pegida Poster Brings Lebanese to Potato Doner Idea
Potatoes or döners?
Both are possible - in the potato doner developed by the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a skewer.
A poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Kartoffeln statt Doner" (potatoes instead of doners), which he had seen on television by chance.
Since then, a grilled skewer has been spinning in his shop, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multicultural for the stomach," Alhay says.
The idea has meanwhile been registered with the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he thinks.
The culinary international understanding was also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground-level campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-based campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as events and Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler carries out its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA store stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that, twelve months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will snatch away about five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and groceries business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it's assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the reduction in operating debt while at the same time putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's Chief Executive Officer, Ian Morrice, says that price adjustments and shop remediation programs will increase and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Association
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is often referred to as "Special Ks", came into the spotlight with the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, in which Harrison exclaimed, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a seizure thwarted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty worried about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a bat when he lost because of a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of appreciation.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's been respected in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra that he will return to the team as a long-term fixture."
"First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick made the climb very quickly, what people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, withholds refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's country and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
For an unknown time, the people who had fled from violence stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water for protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" for migrants to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation bloc could not agree on a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the captivated Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that, eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would accept a further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not hope for an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions announced on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, enabling them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force in Hungary at midnight make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison terms for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree procedurally with the military deployment expected for next week, but Reporters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser to Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to fix the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squeezed a crowd to push into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked Serbia and Hungary's main motorway connection and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for presidential office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead on women and moderates, but these advances have diminished.
Your support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage to democratic voters under 50 years of age has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead on older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a double-digit lead on the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead on this group.
About half of the democratic voters in the national primaries say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if it were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and a further 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of the Democratic voters of the primaries say that they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and selectability is also cited.
Since the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office into the balance, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the primary elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not.
If democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second election for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton increases his lead over Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the election, but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that regards it as the "most selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about selectability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these voters of the pre-elections.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features for voters of their party's primary election.
Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden does best with honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him.
Democratic voters of the primaries generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server are still being asked during her term of office as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of ten, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by their party's voters, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country regard Trump as not being honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good grades at the lead.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush perform best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders as more honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson steps up close to Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in CBS News/New York Times' latest poll
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing ground
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country, with 23% of support in the last CBS survey conducted prior to Fox News last month, 27% in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson is well received by demographic groups and that Trump is outperforming with higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has fallen with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% last month's support to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey released last week shows that Carson is rising in polls - he lands at 19% support to Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising in the past week, Trump found a few side blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for bathers to find still warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people don't go into the sea anymore: A maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, reports the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to be in the Mediterranean: in the east it reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a scandalous ritual of a student relationship in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officers said that he had been blindfolded with a 30 pound backpack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the good of the Brotherhood above Michael Deng's," said Chief of Police Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families were destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died of the harassment every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal organization.
"We don't just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, we will also hold them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the Local Group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the house will be shaken, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance to the economy on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, albeit not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a look based on historical trends on how some sectors of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset income to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after Fed interest rate hikes.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after that (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle of increases and that the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises its interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950 have only had nominal GDP below 4.5 percent twice.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and, according to the Atlanta Fed, expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have prepared for a Fed rate hike all year round, and all eyes have been focused on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trade indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all cycles of increase from 1950 to today have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and have very quickly cast a shadow on pre-recession levels after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the period observed.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far it has been 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer convergence of yields between longer and shorter bonds and a flattening of the curve.
High yield bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from interest rates rising and local products becoming more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have outperformed firms with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the rise in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station for its "dumbness"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they imitated only The Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the station to prove that it does something that the private channels do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "dumb" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be the Brits only under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else -- these are two spontaneously mentioned examples, where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and making music that's really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works, I think, is really important," he said.
Earlier this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that work must be harder to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production, which, during the hearing in the Committee for the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports, was set under fire to step on the feet of the commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it started an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose most slowly in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the start of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slowed down spending
Virtual shopping has boomed for over a decade, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started shopping with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now it's commencing, and we may see growth diminishing.
The black friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers withhold their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of £5 issues, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried in Mecca during the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia challenges the collapse of the huge Saudi bin-laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
The mourners, largely dressed in white, filled the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed by at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the praying ones.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king sanctioned the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beers killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already firmly agreed that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was jointly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the downfall of the crane, which plunged into an inner courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj, which later takes place this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives have not been available to comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officers said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial (£ 174.000) be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount to permanently injured.
Other injured receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 additional Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or brush for painting walls, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the DIY chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, who offer services at the lowest prices, has become obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix shops, which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten shop purchase decisions were made by women.
At the moment, the men prevail among the employees.
She said it was necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the head of a leading British company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has filled exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't difficult to find good women for our board of directors.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the half-yearly profit and revenues after the group shouldered the costs of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vicemaster Aich/Dob were responsible for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was finally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that the defendants used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial offenses.
This fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
In order to throw away the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had not at any time suffered an asset disadvantage.
The sports functionaries had only offset expenses compensation and released the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (approx. 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Are we going to continue the club or are we going to lock it?" said one of the defendants, in the bread trade, a large company auditor of the tax office.
He then decided with his colleague and co-defendant to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We shot up money, put our life insurances down as security at the bank," he said at the hearing.
It was agreed with the association: they can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
In addition, the payment of the expenses compensation had been decided retroactively by 1991 in the event of financial success.
Therefore, some of the cost compensation was paid out only years later, namely from 2003, when a plus had been in the account.
Therefore, even flat-rate and not detailed bookings appeared, the former chairman explained the events.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the disbursements had not been disclosed to the association in detail.
The association had not been interested in the details of the financial transaction, only the debt-freeness was important, the answer said.
When an official investigation for abuse of office began in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club's account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association, according to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
For a long time, the respondent did not know the answer to this question.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified.
This transfer was formulated as "damage restitution".
Why damage compensation?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of line with him."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
In addition, the official said that he had never received a cent's salary, that he had only charged mileage and diets.
On diets he had charged the club 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide precise documents for the early years.
They explained that they had not been kept after an audit, in which everything had been assessed as correct.
Kilometer money had also been received by the second defendant.
All the corrections had been made in cash, for which he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard removes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the personnel reduction that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
Hewlett-Packard's (HP) computer giant's job deletions do not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce its corporate clients by 25,000 to 30,000 jobs.
The company announced on Tuesday that this would save costs of $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion).
The move will lead to a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will start in the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been going on for three years, has not yet been completed.
HP still had around 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
The Hewlett-Packard share declined by 2.3 percent.
The group that grew up with printers from Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: this year, the computer and printer business will be bundled into a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business will be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand of corporate customers for their services recently increased the world's second largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
Sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent in the third quarter of July.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
As a result, revenues fell in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the changes in the industry with a split-up and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only reacted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority Supports Anti-IS Training Mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would be largely rejected: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
61 percent say that other states are flying air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, and 20 percent are in favour.
29 percent couldn't decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The trade fair will focus on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto "Mobility Connects".
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the organizers of the car association VDA expect about 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannon on the Serbian border near Röszke against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He said by phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind it, a police line had formed and behind the police there was a water cannon ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers used pepper spray continuously at first.
After that, the police used tear gas.
Much tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
==References====External links==
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while ago.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The Serbian police press spokesmen also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of the decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world observes when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, who thought the Fed would do so last week, now thinks that the Fed will persist a little longer and that interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed put interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Head of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Deathguards at Delta State University left letters of apology
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "suffering" at the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the 911 staff that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a "sweet dog" in the house, but he'll "never bother anyone," but he'll probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb didn't explain his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45 saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when policemen surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years as a "good man".
They were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "destroyed."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police caught him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his lifelau on the University's website indicates.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggles with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of possession of drugs.
I'm sure all this will take its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa converts the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate conversion.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
The conversion of the Group will cost 150 of the around 1000 managers worldwide the workplace.
The pilots' union, however, has been renegotiated.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment was a contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The low-cost Eurowings airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team headed by Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the repositioning, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120.000 employees strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective dispute with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday after the strike has been stopped by the court.
That's what the union said.
Discussions will focus on the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results "in one year with a predicted record result" as soon as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the Group's own Eurowings low-cost line in the fight against competitors.
Under the title "Morning Train to the South" paintings by Leena Krüger can be seen in the Künstlerhaus.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left defender cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said, "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery starts now, I come back stronger."
Based on this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the defender of England has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this type of injury leaves the course, they are all very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he had touched [Moreno] him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it feels like, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "Favorive, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far."
Everything is beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a synopsis of the 2012 movie version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seus' hostage and who died in 1991 but completely unknown.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins like this: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book's plot. Here an unnamed boy hears the local environment being devastated by the money-hungry, tree-causing, thneed-knitting once-ler, despite the protests of the name-giving lorax, a squatting, purr-bearded being "speaking in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who didn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
To encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the squad England has selected for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out an away victory.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear any scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth leaves the England test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best choice.
Long ago you would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he knocks out more runs for Yorkshire, there'll be another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and I'm not surprised; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test bat gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson in front of him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation you can make was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I'm high on.
He's an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us a lot.
He must have at least the same chances as those before him, but of course this depends on the team formation in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, showed up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a bat can't beat there, and that left-handed guy has already shown that he's a devil's guy from cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the squad as a back-up spider, and in my limited relationship with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may be looking at his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there aren't a large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some smart additions to the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a champion coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup.
I have always felt that he is created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh air, even if the news is in line with what has been said before.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easily in the heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy falls into a slump by 2017
David Cameron's unencumbered renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to get deeper into trouble every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as leader of Labour or TUC, who fought violently over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always on their own fault, are fed up with Britain's self-made agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like them if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime ministers and finance ministers climb on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK looking outside inside the EU tent - "Let's not go alone with France", says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the overly long endurers such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It's hard to imagine that they're going to rip out a leg to help the selfie Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments, entirely in SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust" and "Great Britain won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
You can easily remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist, who made a name for himself as an "EU straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-domestic who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought a similar way about her, but found that when you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum whirlwinds, because Blair had put the principle above the EU's unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door for him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I put it nicely - in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue dye tendency and the wilder realms of Tory's little Englishmanism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, But No Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week when the Boy Scout in him fought not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinette colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow-combatants and deputies after all the reports at their cloister meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the vortex of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free map of Europe that allows him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of meaning for their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - in order to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction by the Tory government in power, as I was reminded of something called British Influence Security Forum at the start of Monday.
Experts Criticise Report by Public Health England on E-cigarettes
Claims from a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Principle Report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinary windy foundation" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims "built on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been called to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to produce a synthesis of their opinions on the damage to various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was previously reported to have received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said that they would receive funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that they reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not provided, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also include industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco management.
The research work of the group "remarkably admits that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we still have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in hard-controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 he had unsuccessfully tried to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC commissions or sends programs that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the Oberhaus Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class window of time because they want to achieve as broad a support as possible for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both self-productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows such as EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs should "go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience pretty much, but they do their job, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for 150 pounds, I wonder if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and maintain".
He said that little of the BBC production is now officially classified as education - he said that it is 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example on public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this into "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on TV, and enter alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into the brain of humans to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasonic nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International anti-weapons trade show video.
Terrible killer drones!
Spinning ankle cuffs!
Scatter bombs!
And electric batons that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a militant parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Are you travelling with DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which transforms into an image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be driving with DLR ... Customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of bus keys, which are claimed to have "access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this placarding "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trading posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was astonished at the silence surrounding the advertising for the Arms Fair - through an empty space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising, but "through the inflating with bright colors and animation it remains more adherent."
"They did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors create fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab discloses an order from the U.S. Army for "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped battlehead that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student dorm, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have angered - and the numerous long-breathed complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student dorms ranges from slightly nerve-absorbing to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to chat: people tell where you come from, whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "really neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people alone.
People's rooms often turn into beverage receptions, film night venues and communal meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Referring to this: Don't think about starting a relationship at the university
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Her room should be a refuge, but many dormitories form a room-to-room stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away to get back the energy I've spent interacting with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by socializing - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorms had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back mania, knocking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked something for you. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to stand asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in dormitories.
Of course stealing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or work.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that you are literally one of the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they care to turn Drum & Bass down a little bit, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
Finally, when they stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she let her own music splinter, locked her door and went to her three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
On the other hand, it wouldn't be terribly embarrassing if you thought of a roommate as your future spouse, got in touch with her, separated again, and then had to see her every day, and maybe see her pull all her friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try at least to talk your abdomen into a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the boundary between an ulcer and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for him to become a boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never mess up anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't fix your possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Town houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who don't have a lot of money in the middle Franconian valley of Eckental.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also the single mother and the low earner."
"I show how to build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push to the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how cheap housing can be created quickly: he builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees are going to push into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we will also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
It took six months to build.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I did my project correctly under construction law.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damoclessert Sonderbau and the parking regulations.
Creepy.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a terraced house need at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you intensify the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It's true that we've had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I'll show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they receive an error message indicating that the "software update has failed".
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is close to a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down half way and this may result in the update being stopped.

You should also make sure that you have looked through our checklist of all things before downloading them to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second emphasized before starting the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve season races and is also a favorite of the Flutlicht Grand Prix in the city state.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British rider was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an influence on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a mist bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot apply the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search will also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" is seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
Quartiersbüro seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, to Graf Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and seeking advice receive information on questions such as care insurance or benefits from health and nursing insurance funds.
For years, our outpatient care service has shown that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endless questions.
"Also not infrequently many services of the cash registers are not used, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood anymore," explained the new owner Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as head of the division Altenhilfe as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the Seniors Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care and Care Center," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both managing directors see the reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city centre as particularly in demographic change.
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized at the inauguration ceremonies, the district office also devotes itself to the solitude of old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third division club Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was set as the date.
The match between FC Eintracht Bamberg and FC Würzburger Kickers in the eighth round of the Bavarian Football Totopokals was finally scheduled.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 pm in the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going on, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the pre-sale of tickets that has now been launched.
It is special for our team to play against a third-party league.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg won the last 16 teams in 2010 with 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and against 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
SpVgg Unterhaching is the defending champion of the league.
Viennese architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the publication.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also worked as a teacher, writer and director of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in Vienna's Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at the policewoman
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese didn't notice well in Bremen.
Footballer was once, meanwhile Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim is engaged, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants 30 kilograms of muscle mass increased over the past two years.
Intellectually, he didn't increase.
Wiese had her hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking guard show a parking ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, insulted the official and threw the fine due in front of her, as reported by the "picture" newspaper.
In the city of Bremen the accusations are confirmed, but are not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination," says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether meadow is displayed or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rain forest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the growth of marijuana plants.
For three days, Panama's authorities have been ripping out the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called out to them that they might wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft filling station.
There were also three people on the site of the gas station.
One of these men now yelled at the youth and punched him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a fracture of the nasal bone and bled heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and calmed down the thug, he let go of his victim.
The injured young man was now taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator chased the group with a car up to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the bat and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim's face and thighs were beaten.
The injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second racket is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to report on the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, business sponsor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still standing by his successor with half a position in the next few months.
After a conversion phase, Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October, until then he will invest 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight, when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and wants to enter the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years".
As an advantage, he also sees himself as his own boss.
And so they agreed, the millers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, Frank Müller, two-time father of the family, grew up, and his medical studies in Hanover followed several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior emergency doctor in Diepholz County and is a volunteer in the Bruchhausen-Vilsen DRK.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"Endoscopy is therefore coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a more speaking room.
In addition, the computer system is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of 50000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the velvet community (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," says Samtgemeinde Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients enter the Felstehausen practice every quarter, whereas in the average practice in northern Germany there are about 500.
There is another family doctor's office in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller's practice acquisition: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have left.
Those who visit Müller's consultation hours, by the way, continue to look mainly into familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning staff from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms", Ursel Felstehausen remembers smiling.
She already feels a little melancholy after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients many more," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughingly: "We have a 6000 square meter plot."
"Until now, I've always been in front of gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being lifted at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.
It was still clear that anyone who wanted to apply for asylum could also make this "self-evident".
The care and safety of the people is in the foreground.
However, she also said, "it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considering "Corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow incoming refugees to continue their journey towards Austria and Germany and could also establish corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the case with Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia would step up border surveillance, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenianin does not want to shut down its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in Eastern Croatia during the night hours on Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Tovarnik since then.
It is mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action.
In the coming days, his country is expecting about 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border so far, would be diverted to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday in agreement.
The government in Belgrade denied, however, that it was it that instructed people to take certain routes: "Neither can we, nor will we do so," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected in the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometres away, through Serbia.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could in fact lead to the already predicted shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
There are strict controls to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and the EU partners have consistently been giving the country a good record of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgo, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgo and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local sight in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at this time.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area there are still not cleared minefields even 20 years after the end of the Croatian War.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of deminers was sent to the border region.
Stock exchange hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals who are accused of having repeatedly gained insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwire and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected is said to have been used to conduct insider transactions on the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were groaned.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught," says the SEC communication.
The trial of 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim exists for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz there is a lot of operation.
People do their errands, sometimes fast steps, sometimes leisurely strolling.
They head for the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Stop the trams.
Pulsating, bulging life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large tablets each with the headline "Before I die I want to die"....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the middle of the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passersby spontaneously picks up the chalk and adds the sentence "yes to my life", "can read", "drive with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "don't suffer for long", others stop short, read, say sentences like "I'm not that far yet" and then go on.
Again and again small discussions about the action itself, about life, about how to deal with dying develop.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"I can only live responsibly if I realize that for me the end will come to this world at some point," says the director of the deaconical work Mannheim, which together with the Caritasverband is the sponsor of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action on the 20-year-old is good.
It is understandable, however, that not everyone on the boards wants to communicate publicly, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still subject to taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the subject through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought volunteers by appeal, it immediately registered and was present at the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences and experiences she has made.
"I see life from another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and non-confessional.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be noted on postcards there.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to an entire year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and become effective on 4 January, and despite higher increases for ground transport of heavy and large parcels, which will be charged from November.
The company said that it nevertheless expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns when considering the weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zack expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has recorded a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its Express shipment unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahogani table to decide if it's time to raise the key rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threateningly above them at one end of the decorated two - story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress: maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most data from the economy show that it is growing solidly, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by raising federal bond interest rates – even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, which in itself makes the financial market insecure.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy would maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the sentences at this time," he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets by eliminating uncertainty as to when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world shrugged at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May when investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would throttle global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better under control.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there's almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "constrict" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that seem not linked to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee with voting rights, who advocates an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, "despite the limited apparent impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only put aspects of financial stability first during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Poznan, former member of the Committee on the Interest Rate Setting of the Bank of England.
The recent turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are upset," said Poznan, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should go ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and crockery, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal in the LAX-C BBQ Express for you.
The cooking kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash desks and has various take-away options.
What is there here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably did.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing section. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and bile, pork natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, even individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash register.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 lances.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum-seekers' home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is completely different from teaching at a real school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shock women about how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding. It does this by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with images of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal councillor Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattened for solar panels.
Planning for the long-awaited gymnasium construction on the Bernrieder sports grounds is progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Prior to this, the board had decided, among other things, to apply for a building legal "exception" or "liberation" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
According to this, a "saddle roof with non-centered first and roof superstructure" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will bring us together a wonderfully large southern roof," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which should be below ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike the development plan prescribed.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was necessary because the plan for the construction of the roof does not allow "exceptions" - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually applies rather restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, gymnastics is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gymnasium building at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from support for school and grassroots sport.
In the next step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the Krankenhaus GmbH of the district envisage, the land councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, the Supervisory Board makes a decision about this, and it will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing Inner Station to Schongau.
The rooms were available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
The employees were informed about the plans.
The change was triggered by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the Medical Director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
The question of who should succeed came into play, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer", who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and to switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrading" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "Innere Medizin", says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specialises in Gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, are to run both houses until next year the former hospital of the shortage, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018 when the ongoing renovation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Councillor Jochner-Weiß, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, has come up against rumors that the house, which is owned by the Federal shortage, will be used as accommodation for asylum weavers in the future.
"I rule out that." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there are several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What was better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," says Fischer about the quasi-movement to Lech, which was received by the employees "positive and very understanding".
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the position of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has repeatedly been threatened with closure in recent decades, and departments have been closed, such as surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar lions are demanded tonight (20.15 o'clock) at the Bergisches HC.
Although the Bundesliga leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season the Badeners took a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two casualties at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the aberration on a cornfield near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in action, as the police reported.
After firing a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospitals.
At first, it was unclear how exactly the accident could occur.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missed 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of violent crimes
A suspect led the police to the body of the missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted that he had killed the youth and threw her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutor's office and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, reportedly confessed the crime and led the investigators to the body's location.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had not come home the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered the victim's personal belongings.
In interviews with the friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a suspicion arose against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrested person admitted in the police interrogation that he had killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the judge on Wednesday, the investigators charged him with manslaughter.
Let's find out more about the circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need shelter: Study warns of housing gaps
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have already begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many big cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable homes.
To meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the Association's Association for Social Housing.
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-time accommodation.
Many then come to the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also highlights significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing a housing deficit ahead, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units were already missing in the metropolitan areas, laments Matthias Günther, author of the study.
For this reason, many professionals lived in large cities in WG-Zimmern.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the slump in the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing" Alliance is proposing a new start.
New incentives are intended to boost social housing.
In this way, the real estate transfer tax could be waived and the property tax on subsidized housing could be suspended for a limited period.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The funding programme for refugee shelters of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary there is practically no way through, since more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the transit via Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Minister of the Interior, Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the foreclosure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to get to Western Europe from there.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
New laws that came into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia in the morning.
According to most media reports, they came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Minesmen should now quickly create a safe passage.
After Hungary, however, there are hardly any refugees after the border has been closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people taken.
Shortly before the deadline on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Sentenced people face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, of which almost all - 93 - were received at the most important crossing Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stayed there.
In practice, however, no one has any chance of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers started cleaning up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in the past few weeks.
Locking grids were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border village was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria only reaches a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
According to government figures, around 20,000 migrants were still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on orders from German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent with suitcases," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees, it ended in Wernstein," says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to Passau.
Before that, we first served the unexpected guests, with snack and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," says Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man did not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE in Wels on Sunday evening to a regional train in the direction of Passau, in order to try it after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped, but still over the border.
However, the regional train was parked off the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The Brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday sociably, on the day before a two-bridge run in sport - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to establish structures that guarantee humanity in the Röszke camp, our Chancellor has brought the Hungarian government's attitude to the haze of National Socialism in a highly official and public way.
Not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in border areas are suffering from this policy.
Refugees will also have to note that the "promised country" that invited and welcomed them is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even bigger one - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-fest quarters
Konrad has his hands full with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already managed the chaos in the first recording center Traiskirchen.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also carried out without great whirlwinds, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterwork".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
Konrad expects a total demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," said Konrad.
He has already had talks with the governors of the country.
They would have assured him that they would also create quarters for the refugees to come.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, who will clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Helpers like us".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be possible for quarters to maintain a certain height of towel rails or the size of the skylights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
Konrad explains with his experience that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in housing.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told the untruth in his face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Their own search for quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seem to be problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is planning no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for housing refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the people concerned can be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In case of an emergency, however, further locations should be checked for their suitability.
The head of the city criticises the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed off"
In a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the head of the state Josef Pühringer (VP) coordinated the further action on the refugee issue on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
Onward migration of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there is now the appropriate border controls.
For the time being, there will be no special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" from the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linzer Industriezeile is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the publicly listed IT company S&T has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies at the New Shipyard and later acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T invested 1.7 million euros in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which each owns one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 per cent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented out, for another 40 per cent there are inquiries.
Lia Peroni owner opened second shop in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade had to postpone this project without delay: after all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and robes of various manufacturers, everything is now about ladies' handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time if I should open another store," Breit says.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in Linz to sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves.
Her fashion interest got Breit laid in the cradle by her mother.
I like the most when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women get in rapture when they see a beautiful handbag, can't the expert woman answer with last resort?
Maybe it's because a nice bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called showers.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciters.
Whether it expresses itself xenophobicly, concerns journalists rudely or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US Presidential Office strongly stirs up the election campaign.
And do a good job.
This is also recorded in the Pfälzische Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire came from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a name for many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant-place is over -ty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstadter Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style either," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, among them Trump and the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the King of Hearts there.
Admittedly, there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to think that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
Incidentally, the nickname, which Kallstadt has in the vicinity, sounds "The Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the showoffs, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the showoffs.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold mine shop in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was the first property purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed due to the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He did not record Trump because he once ran away without permission, Roland Paul, director of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as it's poltert, it's not so likeable," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("Nama was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he is always so frenzied".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
Pension host Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he did not win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge in the USA at the time of his grandfather would have been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than he is," says winegrower's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes become ripe even without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinemagoers, and interest is also aroused in the US.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain climbing village".
The 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism from the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain climbing villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but there has been no major shift in the assessments for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was aired by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull crashed Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number fell behind last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 spectators at 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for checking!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and slightly beat The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour, it reached 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The decline in the second night quotas of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that couldn't beat the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who eventually landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor was wrapped up in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons fellows the day before three become two, you may have accidentally given a clue as to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women have lyrically failed to understand why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could become a game spoiler, who won the heart of the bachelor's degree.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay the best partner for Wood, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought about that throughout the whole course of the show," said Jeavons Fellows.
"Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week's house visit made it clear to her that Wood could be "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was obviously not just a game - I am now fully committed to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a frenzy as the Aussie Rugby League convert did in his first punt return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to make a punt return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his messed-up catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is pacing at a punt that was restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field cursing after the Fumble and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a pass at his own in-Goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rampart with weapons.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company seized Yukos and his democratic efforts stopped.
Free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Head of party and faction Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-Herbstklausur in Großwallstadt of a severe crisis at Bavaria's schools, if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new pupils: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to prevent the schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will get faults in the Bavarian education system."
The Free Electoral Parliament meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian Commune.
In fact, quite different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Electoral Meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will overlay the exam," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as they existed during the Yugoslavian wars in the 1990s.
"This is not the way to go, we have to address the causes," said the Free Electoral Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The head of the FW criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bayern pushes off, others don't."
"We must become more capable of action."
But the state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term torch remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Intermediate level plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the Gymnasial intermediate level from three to four years is tested - as a result, it takes nine years to complete the Abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The issue of G9 needs to be speeded up," said the FW boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

Infineon shares increased by a further 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to one trader, a positive report by the US investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend re-edited.

4 people killed after policemen shoot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before picking up rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, of which it is known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th century.
The four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the commercialization of the 4000-square-meter area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in the immediate vicinity of the youth center Alte Post.
Preparations are under way for this.
It is planned to use the grounds for a mixture of commerce, commerce and housing.
You wait for appropriate offers, it is said from the city.
It was not yet clear which investor would be eligible.
Accordingly, no contracts had yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / corner of Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the cottage settlement at the Kleine Meer near Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some residents continue to be concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure resort
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, pondered, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested person, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented his plans to the city development committee of the Emder Council for the first time in public on Monday evening.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends from the System Building Management went into the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The approximately ten to twelve million euro project has been under discussion for months.
Heavy reactions among seamen who had come to the meeting caused the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the meerbuden and member of the board of directors in the representation of the interests of the residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a huge block, which dominates all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase significantly due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads to make it count," says Schulz.
What happens exactly on the well-one hectare area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First, we must have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were still variable.
Twin offspring at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is delighted with its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth yesterday to twins.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet established, since mother Dian holds them closely to the body.
At first the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a broad rotogravure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands, which has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined rotogravure system in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double-donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million to humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach when announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether lightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained approximately the same for those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Of those undergoing surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% partially resolved diabetes.
In the medically treated group, diabetes was completely dissolved at only one percent and partly at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in blood pressure controls, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the host rectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 2.1%), and was more likely to overcome diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years in obese people undergoing obesity surgery - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for individuals with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes, which have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently becoming increasingly popular in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets again after years the swarm of her youth, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recent novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel is likely to be of particular interest to Hunsrück readers, as it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to place a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents in the circumstances.
He also stressed that the West European countries' response to the refugee crisis was admirable, but not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions such as how real peace and development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attack and pointed out that the U.S. violent response resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand disinfectants by children over the last 4 years
Toxin control centers in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of income from hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them are going to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with mouthwash containing alcohol in order to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents, which are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
Especially in small children, few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call center at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 station in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when children get there, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry scented hand disinfectant in school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to leave when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and bumped her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth grade students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished them from her room.
The police considered the vanquished plan to be "talking" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in a rear-view accident on the cross-section between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-section towards the roundabout industrial area and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he hit the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident suffered material damage of about 10 000 euros, the police informs.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.
Rumor kitchen: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn it around again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson's accusation, and Warburton will be cautious in January's new commitments that could destroy the squad's unit.
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control, as they are preparing for a confrontation with the Dutch champion.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutchman - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said, "In Holland, they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of excitement in the old firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, swears Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic's fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points advantage.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel exactly that way - but we have to keep going.
We really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players better.
It's so important to stand together now.
Warburton cautiously at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entries and insists that he does not want to interfere with the Ibrox squad.
The ex-chief of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract expires with the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later cancelled - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson stays with what he said and insists, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible hibee was reproved after he admitted to having sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex-heart's player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding, "It's safe to say that I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board trusts Dundee United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're gonna get the boys back on their feet," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to "win" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which earned them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that haven't won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than that of the UK of 5.5 per cent, as the figures of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunks disrupted the process
Since the security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officers take the sturgeon into custody.
A breath alcohol test in a 16-year-old showed 0.89 promille.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promilles and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January by his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
If you are chosen, you will watch it motionlessly.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story how he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go into all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for this.
What you're gonna get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of the Canning River after a wet police chase
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and swampy water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "softly persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale were called to a trespass incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,' said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben cousin biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and that he had found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt copper sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage charges and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I intended not to say anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go off in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an occupation in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly grab their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps blames people outside of coaches for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the business?
Am I that bad for the business?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and disobey me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-term cobalt investigation at Lidari, and Late Scratching led him to say that he "can throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated master Black Caviar, described the race-day treatment rule "laughing" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg.
It could have been that way last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it also had it so on race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.
Man Arrested after hit-and-run
The police arrested a man at Cobram on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's escape.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia presented himself to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with flight and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy fights back against rivals for allegations of wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described his players' tackling as an "agenda setting" of two NRL Premier League favourites.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory at the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the Storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the wrestling.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" with Tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team makes him confident, as it means that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything about our defensive system or techniques all year round, but over the past six weeks, we've made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that's what turned the trend for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this happens again and again this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to our one on Friday night and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he's not gonna take care of this shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build more trust because they say these things because they're a bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are taking breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means we're still going to meet them in one phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the pre-finals at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbs with $200,000 deposit after drug charges
A man who may face a life sentence because of his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released for a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Solay yacht, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire crowd and that there might have been a harmless reason in the café.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape from Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 together to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two persons, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reporting to the police daily and holding on to a curfew of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: driver's cab breaks apart
On Tuesday evening, a truck driver was seriously injured in a three-lord collision on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The cab of the causer of the accident was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken seriously to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 o'clock.
A damage of 122,000 euros was incurred.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered "concerning" web searches that used terms to search for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it, as it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "presumed to be a policeman to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to frighten people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment that he had taken indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, that he had violated the conditions on 25 January this year and that he had not appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work.
Hogg was bailed in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Lockers evade small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Along the Inn river, more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
According to Federal Police figures, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8 a.m. alone, around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, said a spokesman in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, refugees reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: foothills of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm gusts in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
The German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced that warm sea air is currently flowing into the country due to a gravitational pressure area over Western Europe.
The strong low is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which in the past days has crossed the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, even in the Black Forest, in the Swabian Alb and in the Bodenseekreis, it is expected to be 60 to 90 kilometers per hour by Thursday morning.
On Friday the sun can be seen again longer.
The crowd does it: Every two years, the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, there was a movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: According to Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA), this segment accounted for around 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (audience days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at dealerships in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive.
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, which include three-cylinder gasoline engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door car.
The second variant will be the Kombi, which can already be seen at the IAA in the spring.
And what is added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door version in a conventional and a highly sporty GT version.
He comes into the trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti fits fully into the design line of the brand with its curved lines.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
There is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp on offer.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno, which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt, is also new in the segment.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
Baleno's sales launch in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën offshoot put their hands on the front: here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified headlamps were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
At the IAA in the compact class, a series of revisions and new versions such as the upgraded Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are added.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court gave the right to an ex-container of the judicial prison Tegel, who was housed for months in a too small cell.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were only locked up in the confined rooms for a few days (cf. 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-container with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: between June and November 2009 he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel prison prison; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now on his own again, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability claim for the unworthy conditions of imprisonment against the Land of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges suspended the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and returned the case to it for further examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in question are relevant for the compensation, there is a claim for compensation, it was stated.
Otherwise, "a deterioration of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared".
The Court of Appeal must now settle the amount of the cash compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
In April, they only granted compensation to a prisoner because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a decision of 2011, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is unworthy.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The then plaintiff was housed daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, aggressiveness is rising, even fighting is said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the Judiciary Press Office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to lack of young talent, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it."
The following overview provides an overview of what is to happen in Germany.
According to different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it is currently being built (250,000 apartments).
The lack of housing, however, is particularly dramatic in the case of affordable rental properties: Every year 60000 to 80000 social housings fall out of the rental price commitment, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments.
Federal Minister of Building Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister for Building agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, says Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround in Germany: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation, which restricted asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the majority of people have accepted the view that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German skills.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most often provided through personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the development of networks is therefore the Königsweg zur Arbeitsintegration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to the kindergarten, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the day care, the administration distributes handbills in different languages.
If the demand for female educators increased sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students without a knowledge of German are prepared for lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state forbids asylum seekers or patient students to study - the only exception so far was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Refugees wishing to study could be facilitated access to the university.
Refugees with a permit to stay or to be tolerated will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not receive a Bafög, since they do not fall within the circle of eligible persons.
Patienced refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for Bafög.From 1 January 2016, this range will be reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, according to Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic welfare association, which professionally takes care of the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control possibilities.
This includes the willingness to take courageous action against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to reside here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He proposed that the Basic Law be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more a topic for the whole of society than it is today.
In this way, the majority society will also have to change and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements such as the Antiracism Convention Germany commit to, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens' opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man-power and capacities, we can do that," he said to Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money had to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all arrivals be given health cards at the same time as registering.
Benefits received could later be settled with the federal states.
In the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided by the Asylum Seekers' Benefit Act.
Otherwise, the doctors are mainly responsible for creating language barriers.
Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has already proven that migrants are being less informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be covered, she demands.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency clinics.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there were significantly more untreated disabilities and young people were concerned about HIV education.
However, with the partly other diseases, German doctors come to terms with their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even see relief in sight.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and several refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practise, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly re-examine them.
According to estimates by the Bundespsychotherapeutenkammer (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who have a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart turf and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong terrifyingness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, the social services would usually decide whether or not a therapy is necessary or not, in the case of employees or doctors who are not trained for mental illness.
This often leads to misjudgements, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion" the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the brick.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Passion" - under this motto stands the current manegen staging.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It's important to us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old junior boss emphasizes.
"Manegencocktail mit Weltstadt-Flair", as Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre-long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of silent movies, the Cuban duo wants to record it loosely.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with sensitivity and joint.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not well, we are not well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read from the eyes as far as possible every wish.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to go into the manege.
So the top priority: take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in a enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," Brigitte Probst says.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17th to 20th September at 5pm and 8pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is Family Day, for the show at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also clouded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and that they were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with shouts.
Last month they booed him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones that warned them not to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating the computer and printer business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and services business activities.
The expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the entity after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in moving to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual sales and "will be focused on providing previously unmatched, integrated technology solutions to businesses," says a statement from the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto Garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP's measure, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given its history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases from Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger sets a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unbeaten even after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measured on the Richter scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lessons from last season with the Champions League Capitulation against Monaco and remains driven from the distant hope of leading the club with its management to its first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends to make a friendship work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyous and successful, even if isolation is actually dominant.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs and Ross' longing for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone soul care explained to me: "My listening role for people who feel depressed and suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one speaks openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you're visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why don't you take your friends for a drink at Central Perk?
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only want to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but also an improvement on their way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the match against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2-2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he walked into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense, before closing nicely past Johan Wiland into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach this level, competed at Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two low in the midfield.
But besides a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp's posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up, with some misjudgements and bad results, not least from Ibrahimovic, who in no less than five attempts alone in the first half of the game and then was given up after Cavani had started it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shotgun, which was pulled by Wiland in the 52nd minute past the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic caught up a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz was able to keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal in the end.
Malmö's coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
The London-registered company Glencore stated in a statement that it has sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in trading early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to redeem around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new 125 pence stakes per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the Group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday noon 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on September 25th, returning President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosting Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders had bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberspionage and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440-hp sports cars rented and scrapped
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the county of Gotha you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from the county of Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, fell into a sling on wet road and drove into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage to property is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 transfer to FC Bayern
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously close to Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times Club World Champion, two times European Champion, one time World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already standing before the 2008 European Championships before leaving Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't win anything," he says.
And that was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rumnigge wanted me."
Remembrance: Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not occur.
And today the decisive man works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria's 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the royal class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen screenplay of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, do it with the cast of the film and not with the cast of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as the comments of the actor of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of the Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
Dear White People's producer supported the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights of the film; Damon replied that their director "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO KNOW that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide impact and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The network Black Lives Matter is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogules invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the grand prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competitor who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the grand prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had it to live," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
The executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, would not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time will get it," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, he gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he's got any grudge about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They were once one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in the final place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, though only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit six times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and so I want to go into the game very concentrated.
The designated tiger-hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-way hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He swung the batter well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (beat training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into play.
With three runs behind the scenes at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back in the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a Colorful, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overcame Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated Rookie striker Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall scored an RBI double against the Tigers' Closer Bruce Rondon and scored the 5-4 level.
The right-handed man, however, stabbed Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from Phil Hughes, who was not yet mobile, at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been dropped from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month due to a back pain.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers increased in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose for the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever right-handed A.J.Echter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to injury to the litter shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder tear, is scheduled to be activated for launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is cut off from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th
He's been missing since August 20th because of a fracture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in it will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They should then be redistributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government bureau responsible for the initial reception.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
Wolfgang Ischinger, head of the Munich Security Conference, considers military measures with German participation in Syria as an opportunity.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options for action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away".
Four years ago one was glad that the chalice of a military participation passed Germany.
"Now the conflict is coming to our doorstep in a crash," he said at Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees on the ground.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also sent no refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's what's agreed," she explained.
Concerning the question of an agreement under which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to discussions in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come from Hungary to Austria via the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann together with several other EU Heads of State and Government requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU Member States have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
Next Tuesday (22 September) EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of a further 120 000 refugees at a special meeting.
In view of the strong demand for refugees in Germany, the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of the people.
The Federation will manage this together with the Länder, Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would also receive it.
But anyone who does not have a chance to stay can not stay in Germany either.
This view was very much shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometer-long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary wanted to prevent tugs from looking for alternative routes across Romania to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, eyewitnesses report that thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the ice tank of Saturn's moon, Enceladus, a global ocean swarms.
This is concluded by researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Thus, the moon is easily tumbling on its orbit around the ring planet.
This tumbling movement is only small, but still too large for a permanently fixed celestial body, says a message from the Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
"Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon in 2006, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed down at that time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must forgo about one month on offensive actor Valdet Rama.
The association reported that an investigation had revealed an additive injury to the 27-year-old.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to the Munich lions, the diagnosis means "expectedly four weeks of forced leave".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a heavy loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper, with a view to the possible commitment of an associationless professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat is currently "possible to prove its ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his concussion next week.
Already on Thursday the Austrian national player should enter the running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on the head.
However, contrary to his initial fears, he remained without a serious blessing.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But he who wants to pay attention to his narrow line is often advised not by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The skin color alone doesn't say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US package service UPS again hires up to 95,000 extras for the US Christmas business.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are wanted.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce by 95,000 for the holiday season.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early arrangements to be prepared for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First Föhnsturm, then striking cold front
In the coming night, the Föhn breaks through the valleys of the Alpine North side, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night for Thursday the hair dryer blows partly with stormpower through the hairdryer valleys.
After Föhnend on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rains, wind gusts and a temperature drop.
According to MeteoNews, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive gravure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the northern side of the Alps, the Föhn breaks through the valleys on the night of Wednesday.
As a result, the hairdryer blows in the hairdryer valleys with gusts from 60 to 100 km/h until Thursday morning, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km/h.
The hairdryer can sometimes reach the bordering central country, and on the mountains even hurricanes of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the alpine south slope begins to build up.
This is where rain starts, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, in the next 48 hours south of the Alps, some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer runs out of air, followed by a cold front with strong, partly witty rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and temperatures decrease significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north autumnally with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south, however, it becomes sunnyer and warmer on the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a nameless square in the park on the Oppio hill was christened on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was applied for by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes could for centuries only live their faith in secret as a minority.
The square is symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent some months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time, he felt the city was a depraved bible of sin.
His negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then initiated with his theses against the indulgence trade the split of the Western Church.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has received his "language" with colorful colours and imaginative forms - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the book of all books.
Cycles have emerged that focus on topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments, or the Lord's Prayer.
In doing so, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this is true for Luther's publishing house with its theological orientation as well as for Kettler's publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist, who formulates here his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
That's a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"There the education happened before with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this up in order to perhaps get along with the Father again."
His second concern was to help art become more important in fast-paced times: "The perception of pictorial worlds is today characterized by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being replaced there.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "fall into the picture", let it affect himself, discover and feel what power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation that he "always" was a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his paintings."
Old people did not take care to fully grasp the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, including mysterious ones.
"This was not a cooperation on an equal footing," says Altepost: "This is about the images, the text merely explains."
For Hans Möhler from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak for Moehler both the (biblical) language of love and the responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened at the Otmar Alt Foundation on 15 November.
Start of construction for BMX-Bahn nears
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, ground hill modelled for a circuit: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn it was already over.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills are deported, new space is sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission.
The approval will be received in October, the First Councillor Sabine Mosenbach-Bock was now able to inform the children's and youth committee.
"I hope that visible things will happen this year," she said.
It should then be started with the work at the former indoor pool without a "further commemoration break".
DFB strengthens commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is setting a clear signal on the weekend.
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and assures policymakers of its help in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge facing our country since reunification."
"No one can basically say that's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must interest everyone to get this topic under control," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the chancellor."
"The topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football can and will help.
However, policy must set the decisive course.
The German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach explained on the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesligaers also support this program.
Already this weekend the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-evident".
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, no one is allowed to look away."
"We football Bundesligas can, no, use our power, influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
This Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualification match against Hungary.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a large joint venture of German football".
It was great that all 36 license clubs had started their own projects in their locations.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already retrieved the entire amount for 2015, too," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye in a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's home in the USA, he fell on a glass of water after midnight, which he carried in his left hand, reports the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled out, passed out, then dragged himself out onto the street - he told us that last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October, we will meet in Walldorf before the Supervisory Board meeting," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Süddeutsche Zeitung) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software company.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
To him it is important to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anyone can do something like that."
"It's important to get up again when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of action...
Magnussen tweeted a photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
At the night race in Singapore on the weekend, he is no longer eligible as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Japan Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europa League were finally shattered.
The national player will also miss the top of the Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 am/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we can't fall back on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be there again on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
In view of the high strain on his pros, Tuchel will not only change his parentel on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper's position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of his regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level", praised the football teacher the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future.
He will also play the second match with a high probability.
The insistent statement by fellow player Reus that the final move for BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, thinks middle-field player Julian Weigl to be understandable: "This is not so wrong for Marco."
"I think we have a good chance to pick up the title."
Robot Cars: Government Wants a Pioneering Role for Germany
According to the will of the Federal Government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt, Dobrindt spoke of a "new mobility age" on the edge of the IAA car trade fair.
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
Among other things, the Ministry of Transport's strategy paper stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
A test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
In order to ensure that the driver is not "burdened with additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to promote a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, and the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected far after 2020".
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German location for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
"Digital networking of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars as skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dekra presented at the AA on Wednesday concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars to be used by 2025, while in the USA, 33 percent.
Without that, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the Bitkom digital association, only seven percent would agree to leave control on all roads throughout the journey.
On the motorway, 15 percent could imagine this in the running traffic, and 45 percent in the traffic jam.
Well, every fourth person would not let the car control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis-EM
According to the current situation, the Düsseldorfer wants to open only in singles in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at this time on a long-term sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
However, the Hamelner, who leads the list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded of the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo was also missing, and we have become European champions."
"This is what we should be orientating ourselves on," explained the world ranking five.
English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno at a tackle and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a shin fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger's 20-year-old fellow player.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say anymore today that I'm the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, but now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the sidewalk to the catwalk), which can be seen in the Art Hall of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung from 18 September, it is a good thing that the fashion designer changed his initially negative attitude towards a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already made a stop in Montreal, Canada, and Paris.
"It's all about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It was about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man, who has written fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not structured, but it is an outstanding choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort has been put into it: for example, a stylist was specially engaged to dress the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers carried 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer's first timid, fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
His parents wouldn't have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told us in Munich.
Later, of course, I bought them.
For his first fashion show he could not pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers, who, for example, further processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modesspitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze fashion played a greater role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past eras of styles, creates an increasing potential for order.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
They already account for half of our orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and Embroidery together with nine other companies.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of the turnover has been broken.
There are almost no more private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and are almost exclusively distributed through chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So there are sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the stick bead in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch office of the West Saxon University of Applied Arts Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
A tension arises between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine embroiders small beads in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before that I could not do anything with traditional Plauener Spitze".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney is planning new "Mary Poppins" movie
You don't want to touch legends, but Disney still dares a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", this is not about a remake, but about a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magical nanny.
It is about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews, is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi pushes to open the economy wider to the world
The economy needs to open up more widely to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group tasked with steering the reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list to regulate market access, ease border control policy, promote state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital, and overhaul the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them," said the statement.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also included Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and thus expect consumers to have a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons", are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU intends to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller Friedfish, such as carp, are usually so low-loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum levels today.
The lowering of small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion that only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which accumulates strongly over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn people".
However, the Federal Environment Ministry states on its website that "a health hazard to the general population" cannot be expected in view of the current maximum levels.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion.
The German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany, according to written information from the Federal Environment Ministry.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanent and widespread," the "Spiegel" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings on mercury in fish were already one of the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
