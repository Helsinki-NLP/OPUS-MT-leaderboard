Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The big fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, was extinguished. This was reported by the Prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday that night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
The fire could be stopped
Buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol from US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory already made headlines in the past - for example, when a leak released the gas methanethiol in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015 about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system after an industrial accident.
Woman quits her job to look for her missing bitch for 57 days
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job for it. Seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days of the bitch lacked any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four or four and a half hours ago", Carole King remembers opposite "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days became weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a mailman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called in and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King said, "Daily Inter Lake." The tears flowed. People stopped in her vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Loss at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them have so far been traceless. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 pieces of weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This emerges from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which the editorial network Germany reports on.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one gun part and 3474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared. The still missing weapons and gun parts are among others six machine guns of type MG3, eleven rifles of type G3, four rifles of type G36, six signal guns and two pistols of type P8. In addition, 30 gun pipes for machine guns of type MG3 are missing.
The extent of the loss of weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "fearing," said left-wing parliamentman Martina Renner. This is all the more true, as little was found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "needy balance". Renner criticized that the listing did not reveal whether the missing ammunition was also the one found in connection with the investigation against the suspected Bundeswehr officer Franco A. "Even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possession of these ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As vessel observation data from Refinitive showed, the tanker set off and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was designated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government already on Monday, but initially it remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official statement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" had been charged on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Strait of Hormuz with violating safety regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which is part of the United Kingdom.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the Straits. Tensions in the region have increased enormously in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the former GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the chancellor recalled the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken away from terror," she said.
Musk Aspires to Deliverance Record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record. Despite the boom in deliveries, the electric car company has recently suffered losses.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given a strong boost to his electric car group with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, said Musk's circular. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. To do so, Tesla had to provide as much resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. This was no longer the case for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95000 cars and thus achieved its previous record.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and coming quarter. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, losses have recently occurred.
Solved Puzzles: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebral brain prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin discovered this with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress had also been made on the question of why children fight so hard against tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it had also been shown why the approaching of a tickling hand caused laughter even before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebral brain, which triggers the laughter already in anticipation of the tickling.
According to earlier research, rats react with "Laughter" in the ultrasound area when tickled by humans. This "Laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touching
So far it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and touch by others - therefore humans cannot tickle themselves. In the experiments on the rats, however, the Berlin researchers found that the laughter as well as the activity of the respective area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touching. This was also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh was intensified.
But if the self-touch and the touch by others passes at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves, because the self-touch activates a brake in the cerebral brain.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, in the experiment, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely, showing escape behaviour or terrifying rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioural reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Great fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The great fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, was extinguished. This was reported by the Normandy Prefecture of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no substances harmful to health were reported. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

The chemical factory already made headlines in the past - for example, when a leak released the gas methanthiol in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015 about 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system after an industrial accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of the Parliament following the lifting of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without an agreement from the EU on 31 October should Brussels fail to respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, it is unclear how he wants to achieve this.
About Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to reunite this country would be to withdraw from the EU." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorial to attacks of Oslo and Utöya will be unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a memorial is unveiled on Saturday in Norway in honour of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Rose) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They remind us of the roses that thousands of people had left in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled in the same place - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. The opening is expected by Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first set off a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants in a youth camp of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed during the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which was held in Iran, was able to set sail again. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now sails to Dubai for medical investigations, among other things, explained shipping manager Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "Nice that it is over," he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the setting of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on 19 July under the charge of having violated the regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and grueling situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to reunite them with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that after setting the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar, where a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, had been put on the chain at the beginning of July. According to the authorities, the delivery was against EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the US.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Conjectures that it was a trade to free the "Stena Impero" rejected London vehemently.
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil export is shipped through the Straits. Tensions in the region have increased enormously in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US left the international nuclear agreement alone, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter and extended agreement on other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection powers, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In view of the punitive tariffs imposed on Chinese producers by US President Donald Trump, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-dispose themselves. Financial leaders of Asian companies who are considering transferring their production from China to another country call India one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. Of course, this does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more important role in the globally branched production chain.
But now India itself is in Trump's focus. Derogating from the heodegen in the White House as the "Kingdom of Customs", America withdrew the trade concessions for 2000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The USA is prohibiting high tariffs on India and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, just a side-show. In addition, America looks at the world's largest democracy also through the security-political glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's demands for power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just started a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh himself in safety.
However, the problem lies in another place: The empirically substantiated thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a difficult status in the socialist Republic of India. Even under Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at bureaucratic madness, which suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit for too long in the multi-ethnic state. Companies now receive fast building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more grippy insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for this, seems to liquidate companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, much has turned for the better in India in the first five years of Modi. However, this does not apply in trade policy. The National Conservative Government even established new barriers to protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, modes depend on the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, however, the "India First" advocate never deviated from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the foreclosure of their industries are among the regular voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac will be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported, citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral was scheduled for Sunday in the Paris Invalidity Cathedral, as the media reported.
Carrying the competitor into the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to fluctuate dangerously. He could barely hold himself on his feet 300 meters from the finish line, ran in an unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly succumbed to him and dragged him to the finish line supporting the last half of the stadium round. However, the forces were still enough in both of them to stop the watch running along the finish line. As if the scene hadn't been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he caught the attention of the assembled journalists completely unexpectedly. He did not want to talk about his heroism at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not even have started. "That is why I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
That's what he did in the evening with force - and much more intense than he would have imagined. This feat will be remembered. Dabo even left his competitor Busby in front of the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, everything had nothing to do with it, because the Busby who came to the finish only with a lot of help was disqualified at the end of the World Light Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, had started to make a personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, but he was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes already". However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million-Mash: Egyptians Prepare for Wild Day of Protest
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. On Friday, an increased police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had stepped up their road controls and partially searched pedestrian cell phones on news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian construction contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million-dollar march" in central places in the country for Friday. Ali demands a "popular revolution". The man is also no "gooder" for most young Egyptians because he was a sub-contractor for the army, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures could not be confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'," HRW informed on the basis of lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the arrested range from 'distribution of false information' to membership in a 'terrorist association'. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, also randomly searched passers-by according to HRW information.
HRW also criticised censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Dispatch agents should be able to donate returns easier
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from VAT on donations in kind, the Ministry explained to a question from the Green parliamentary group, which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only a small amount of VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the German citizens would send back every sixth package of orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - ended up in the garbage. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities rate donations in kind like a turnover, which then incurs VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies cannot evaluate products for sale and donate to non-profit organisations free of charge. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other shops from the fashion store to the hardware store.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the restoration of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes". Starting Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on October 3rd. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again, at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, which was formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change owner for a million dollars.
Most recently, on Wednesday at the first meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after the abolition of a foreclosure by the Supreme Court of Johnson, had delivered a hard exchange of views with the opposition. Johnson wants to execute the Brexit, which has already been postponed twice on 31 October, without agreement with the EU if necessary.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes with the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top advisor. Compared to the pre-Brexit 2016 election campaign, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy it. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of "betrayal" to the people, among other things. Allegations that he could thereby put the MPs in danger because they might become a target of death threats, he dismissed as "humbug."
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace was if the MPs finally respected the British's decision to leave the EU. It was not surprising that people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," said a statement. "And we should listen too".
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance at the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, said Khan at the Uno General Debate in New York on Friday. "If this is going badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers control a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had deprived the Indian Kashmir region of its autonomy and thus abruptly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt the government reacts with a hard hand. It shoots at the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2000 arrested join the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario like in the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Those who want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who they finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be when large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv exams in the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
For two months, it was checked whether the complex system mesh works in conjunction with BER fire protection. Operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv checks in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed exam, but also said that there are still deficiencies in the terminal to be dealt with. "We have many detail topics, but we don't have a real show stopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is not expected to be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for the beginning of the year this autumn.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be corrected; the Tüv wants to check them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, we must continue to work intensively on the processing of the defects", said a written notice.
Lütke Daldrup said that, in many cases, there is a lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable paths are attached. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the station below the terminal does not work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons, which shut down in a fire like a screen, so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was supposed to go into operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, costs have risen from two billion euros to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the responsible parties are planning to expand the airport. That is why the special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October should take place, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster changes to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, personnel manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finance on her feet.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs blown up - police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and he blew up several vending machines in Chemnitz's city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply. A million damage has occurred!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police grabbed a 33-year-old German at Bürgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the induction of explosive explosions in crime unit with particularly severe cases of theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He obviously financed his drug addiction with the loot." Between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019, the bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstrasse four times alone.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The automata bomber is now in pre-trial custody, and the police investigation continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automats in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines to APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa billiger Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. AUA will take over from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, the speaker said. The flight times will be adjusted to connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other hand to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for the company's sister AUA. Amongst other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight numbers, but mainly with Eurowings equipment. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight numbers will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At Vienna Airport, a price struggle broke out after the Niki broke out. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be upgraded to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airliner will send four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as an bypass construct to the collective agreement.
On Friday, the battle announcement by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years' time, AUA board member Andreas Otto replied: "We will remain number one on site, in five, six or ten years."
Queen Uncle Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four gets married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holiday at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31), which the palace announced on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can't wait to actually be married," said the couple, who has been together since October 2018, in the official announcement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and have also been published on her Instagram account.
A Royal Festival
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. Further information on the date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Using the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. The high-mountain clinic Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved from Switzerland.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the main factors that can be influenced by the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, according to the hospital. Every year about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in researching other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New insights into the interaction between the heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, also stressed that there was a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases. Until now, the Klinik der Stiftung in Davos has mainly dealt with allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine was to be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics was to be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biosamples of healthy participants come from Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 subjects. In the genetic decryption process, the scientists ensured the protection of anonymous data. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human being can now be decoded within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, still cost several hundred million euros. The study is to begin on 1 October, and all 9000 samples are to be analyzed by the end of 2020. The following year, first results are expected.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to evidence from local residents, security forces searched the school in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, and discovered the victims, some of whom were still minors, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the protégés had been held by their teachers under "degradable and inhumane conditions," said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the report, the Koran school has existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents had shown themselves shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger over the past ten months.
Chained up and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have freed nearly 400 students from appalling circumstances. "Many of them were chained up and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a notice in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "unworthy of human beings". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured students in a noticeably poor health condition.
World football election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. Lionel Messi is the sixth award and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations came from other countries to Fifa. Egypt was not rated at all - with a curious reason.
Much of the Fifa has proved to be offensive in recent years: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Footballer election has not yet been suspected of running out of order - if one refrains from the fact that the national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote according to sympathy rather than objective assessment.
But after already complaining to Nicaragua's captain that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
Fifa apologizes in that "the signatures on the ballot forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian Association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach also surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Messi on number one, Virgil van Dijk on number two and Sadio Mané on number three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was just as well received, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made allegations: "Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted on his behalf.
From the association came the message on Friday: True, but of course it was not intentional. The completed electoral documents were "irreally" marked with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was stated in a message from the association. But actually the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We assume responsibility for the administrative error", it said in the message. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases are now being examined by Fifa, but it is stressed that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So long Lionel Messi remains undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans advocate official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against US President and Party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Republican Governor Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the dismissal of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden has been watching "for years".
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair, few have shown any discomfort. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already opposed Trump's policy on several occasions, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have no formal say in the case against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, first Republican senators have also expressed their criticism of the situation. Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also reports that first cracks were occurring internally among Republicans.
The affair could result in the initiation of an impeachment trial against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation to this effect, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make an impeachment effort. However, the decision on actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a trial are therefore low. So far, no US President has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had illegally directed the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After strong protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against Rackete are being made. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". Suspects were arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police reported in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even murdered. Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," the message said.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed up".
Italy's right-wing former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately requested an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk Aspires to Deliverance Record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given a strong boost to his electric car company with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, said Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. To do so, Tesla had to provide as much resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. This was no longer the case for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous record.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures are required for this in the current and coming quarter. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, losses have recently occurred.
US budget dispute: once again only one bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing until November 21.
Although US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will once again be there without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on October 1st. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21st. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump must still put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the Federal Administration will be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the 2019 financial year ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not agreed in time on the 12 expenditure laws, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of majority voting.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion to build the wall, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the building of the wall and its financing, which is actually planned for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the building of the wall was escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the wall building the spirits separate
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond November 21. Even a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the Congress's continuing inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of shutdown, ideas for automating the process gain popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the funding of the federal administration at the previous year's level, suspend the parliamentarians' travel activities and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a bill by the government, according to which all women can benefit from in vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also opposed to the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which defended health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by the social security.
Insemination with semen of dead husband further prohibited
By a small majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the semen of their dead husband for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past, there have been cases in which women complained in vain of the release of the semen of a deceased person. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that a child so begotten carries a "especially heavy fate".
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition, on the other hand, spoke out in favour of artificial fertilisation with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be forced to "double grief" if her husband's death would also leave her child's wish unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow may in future be fertilised with the semen of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only permitted for heterosexual couples who cannot produce children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for flight tax for universities are getting louder
There is a lot of flying at universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. Rectors say that they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about a climate tax on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed before the summer break, is again coming into momentum. After the regional rector conference had reacted sceptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university plead for compensation for service flights. This is the first step "necessary", while there must be a broad debate about the avoidability of flights, according to their opinion. The cabinet decision, which was originally planned in July, is still on hold because the CDU has still not approved the Greens' proposal.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the captured were illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a gunfire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, which means that North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard is patrolling, according to its own information, to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 octopus seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 octopus were discovered and confiscated on the boats, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there for some time this year.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-meshed synthetic nets that were banned in Russia. They would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
Only 18,000 in the future: USA lowers asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives at the White House.
The richest country in the world is shielding itself from those seeking protection: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal migration of refugees is further lowered. In future, mainly threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be let into the country, as the US Department of State stated. In the already almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's government has drastically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, far higher reception limits had applied.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. Nevertheless, the U.S. State Department called the "most compassionate and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the language used by the incumbent U.S. President.
Trump explained that a "responsible approach" to refugees aims to ensure that refugees can return to their home countries in order to help rebuild them. He received a lot of support from supporters for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyi affair and a potentially imminent impeachment process.
According to the US Foreign Office, the US government intends to focus in the future on the reception of two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger, as stated in the Foreign Ministry's statement. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, will receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The US wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred to a detention centre for apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine justice authorities from the former zoo of Buenos Aires. "Sandra", born in 1986 in Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", which is why her release is mandatory. The animal was taken to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilogram human monkey is not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" has to pass through a roughly 40-day quarantine at Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal conservationists in 2014, has helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational centre for the conservation of biodiversity is to be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded at the nearly 3000 meters high Great Peak in the Italian Alps a new Hussar Ride.
Without net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss defeated the 550-metre-high north face of the Great Peak in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute vertigo freedom, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus, he undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European North Faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, US sporting goods manufacturer Nike recorded a significant increase in profit. Net profit increased to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter (nearly 1.3 billion euros), which is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period up to the end of August. Nike's sales figures rose by 22 percent in China most strongly, benefiting the Beaverton Group in the US state of Oregon from its approach to directing itself directly to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased with the quarterly figures - the sporting goods manufacturer's shares increased by more than five percent.
Life-long stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud of being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted on late Thursday. He had reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma follower must never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation hasn't improved, and that's very serious. You have to identify those in charge and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants at the first league game between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rival fans of record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them are not expected to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, according to the police. For the rest, prohibitions of four to seven years apply.
The fans are connected with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra fan groups around Juventus. Among other things, the twelve are accused of heavy blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the Generation Z is political - whole generations are considered with catchy terms. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call, the crab catch at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun officially started on September 21st, which also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The magnificent natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started cultivating crabs already in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into an important industry that has generated high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. Over the past few years, Gaochun has actively engaged in large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as technology-based crab farming. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers' incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and public services" and has carefully built up the service network for "permits under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending". Thus, the city wants to optimize the environment for permits, services and development comprehensively.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local benefits of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and exploits the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as signposts for setting up intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health sectors, and organic farming companies that are leading in the "3+2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism zone, covering all areas, and of tourist sites of national importance. Here, the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape have been integrated, the state of buildings for civic services and for public services has been extensively improved, the tourism + and "+ tourism" sectors have been vigorously developed and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level has been advanced. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iran's President Hassan Ruhani, after his return, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions from the UN General Assembly. The United States, in return for talks with the Teheran leadership, had called for an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on its official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted Iran's counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation in this way: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says that I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of sanctions that should be put to an end was open to debate. "And they clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions."
However, Ruhani criticized that this move had not taken place in an acceptable way. In view of the current sanctions and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes shook Western Turkey within a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases the concern for a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions. Now the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - among other things, made grim by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Town planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces registered as refuges in the centre have long since been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August had the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake on Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as the civil protection agency Afad reported. A small aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. TRT, the state broadcaster, showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in Silivri District for security reasons. Some students cried, as can be seen in pictures.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. Thursday's earthquake hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have got so-called go-bags packed with everything they need ready to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordination center (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings were shaking. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than on Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the time of the quake is 13.59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a aftershock with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of the magnitude 4.6 shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt up to Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the civil protection authority Afad announced already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy said to the station. "The big earthquake will come sooner or later."
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake caused great worries also in Istanbul. In Albania there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance the earth had quaked this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair for the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment process, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian President provides important evidence for an investigation against the President. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt". He also questioned the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passengers locked in toilet - Airplane redirected
Because a passenger was locked up in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines has been diverted. The toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline reported according to the US media.
At an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour she had been locked in it, wrote US media referring to other passengers. To continue the flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the plane.
In a video broadcast on the Internet, which is supposed to come from flight 1554 according to the US media, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We're currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. It was open at first whether the woman would receive compensation.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, according to Diogenes Verlag (Zurich). It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now suddenly is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice and is wildly determined to be stopped by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted as saying, "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers are shamelessly lying like the Soviet leaders once, if Brexiters in high positions almost beg the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write." McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "Machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first novel, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself as "a tremendous vermin," is gradually being excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that is upside down," says Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce noise from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all trips one day after his insolvency application until and including 31 October 2019. Travels could not be started "for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid for. The company left open the way for travel starting from 1 November 2019. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently host Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers will no longer be asked to pay extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas-Cook travelers are not requested or otherwise forced to pay individual hotel invoices by these hotels from now on," Spokesman Bernd Engelien continued.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, the insolvent travel provider will be agreed on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to information from Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on their way. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return journey of the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced withdrawals from hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the road. It looks bad for Thomas-Cook customers who want to go on vacation. On late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips would be cancelled until and including 31 October. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
The company left open the question of travel starting on 1 November 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined. In principle, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys blasting mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's engagement. In Africa, he is now walking directly in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed with a blue splinter protection vest, British Prince Harry has set off and destroyed a blast mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit in front of TV cameras running on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same detonator who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path that she then went. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She, too, had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Halting Brexit negotiations: the danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear commitment: there will be no third postponement of the Brexit negotiations with him, but what statements have been made in the polarizing British for a long time. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the UK hovers like a Damocles sword over the Blondschopf. His suspension of the parliament in order to be able to persevere his Brexit course until the exit date was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by the parliament obliges Johnson to extend the bilateral talks in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October. However, Johnson had categorically ruled out this again and again.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure doesn't seem to be passing by Johnson, either. Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, he suggested that, in the event of a non-agreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best of all, with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And the time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. About six weeks, the EU and the British negotiators have had time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. However, the recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October is currently rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister fails to comply with the law, a new postponement of the exit date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. She fears that Johnson might somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
U.S. authorities: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. Furthermore, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the US Health Authority CDC reported. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" there were already more than 900 sufferers, some 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fear of New Protests in Egypt Growing
Mohammed Ali's videos have been shared millions of times in online networks, and the Spanish developer and actor is calling for a "people's revolution". Today, Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, to which critics accuse corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass demonstrations with a million participants in the country's central squares.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in the past days, the police had intensified their road controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians on news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW reported, citing lawyers.
The organization also criticised censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox of Greenland Expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was greeted by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
In recent months, Fuchs and a team of scientists have investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, the polar scientist said. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the Earth was warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under exclusion from the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone of Greenlandic glacier ice was measured and fished with nets for microplastics, they said.
The polar scientist from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great model," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic over the past decades."
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two dishes of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: that seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases are detrimental to Rome's reputation. We call on the police to look into the question of whether this is a fraud," said a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The restaurant's owners responded promptly. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this cannot be taken from the bill. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was also normal, the innkeeper said.
After the turbulent revelations of the past few days, US President Donald Trump could actually be faced with an impeachment procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation into the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is from weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal there is supposedly a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation to the public out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the USA with his complaint, is monstrous: the president abused the power of his office to use the government of another country to influence the election of 2020. He had exploited Ukraine's dependence on the press and thus wanted to force it to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be understood in the meanwhile published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full text. However, the phone call of July 25th is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which stands above all his personal lawyer alongside Trump: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected president Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation, for which we have the right," he says to the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government".
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have infected himself with right-wing conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's counter-candidacy in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, in order to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations in the US. However, this accusation was never serious.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will be making on the phone with Selenskyj so prominently in July. Giuliani's version and the President say: former vice president and currently promising candidate for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, as the Obama administration's Ukrainian commissioner, have urged the dismissal of Ukrainian Attorney General Wiktor Schokin, who was responsible for stopping the investigation of the gas company on whose board his son Hunter Biden was working. Biden senior had extorted Ukraine financially to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behaviour, and the US government was by far not the only Western partner who urged his release. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Interference with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive malfunctions on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the UK and Spain are particularly affected. On the website alleörungen.de users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 3.30 pm. Also Instagram gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems to be affected by the malfunction, although so far not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by interference
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in previous cases, users use Twitter this time in particular to air their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were on a dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, at just ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, and 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have been brought back safely to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have come onto the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When charging wirelessly, however, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives up the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Each individual degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also doesn't last that long. Thus, the lifespan is lower. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since a battery replacement with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of a battery replacement even once more - and indeed for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient:Just put the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels as well as cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug-in floundering. Since Qi (for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, with which even Apple exceptionally participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
According to a Nepalese climber, he climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer informed.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: from him comes a photo of climbers in the spring, who are in line on Mount Everest.
The image of the mass crowd sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest summits of the earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
One problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. One reason for this is the bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable him to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists earlier rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously remained harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed each year by elephants. This happens mostly when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Their killing is theoretically the death penalty.
British Oil Tanker Arrested Leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after his arrest by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, Bandar Abbas announced this. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had imposed the British flag tanker on 19 July under the charge of disobeying regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in Critique
The responsible Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to examine the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook in detail. It is about the salary packages of the board as well as the question why the British government did not want to join the company struggling for survival financially. "Our interest is in the supervision in the company as well as the control by external auditors", said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "We obviously have a bad example of management greed".
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the family-wide increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg have concluded this in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore probably heavier than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colon cancer, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
This is what Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek" on Thursday (local time). The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. To do so, Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. This was no longer the case for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. Six-digit figures are required for this in the current and coming quarter. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low here. Despite the boom, losses have recently occurred.
Does British government want to bypass Brexit law? Johnson reluctantly
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the last law passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a question he only said on Friday in front of journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law to the post-EU phase-out period.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran apparently goes up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they did not stand by their promises, he promised "further steps" away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained the commitment to normalize economic relations with Tehran in return. In 2018, the US went out of the agreement alone in order to force Iran to change course in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and now again relies on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran responded to this last with a resurgence of the limited uranium enrichment in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium. According to IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rohani suspected. However, there will still be further talks, which hopefully would provide a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, the situation changed in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had announced the attack, which the US considered false. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," Rohani said. However, the European leaders could not have done so during the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would have called for the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, Rohani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration be lifted. He called on the Washington government to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of Other Star Crosses Solar System
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was achieved before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn from other solar systems.
What was initially only a conjecture is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was christened after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The comet had been discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was sighted when our solar system flew through.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get close-up insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears in no time. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. "The present speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun," says Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa in a message.
According to the analyses, the comet is travelling on a so-called hyperbel railway, which takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honour of its discoverer, the interstellar Schweifstern, which was initially led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, whereby the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted in the approach. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. Thus, a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a first investigation the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a distinct tail of the comet.
Researchers at the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first spectrum from the interstellar tailstar, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years, according to the IAU, suggests that these objects could open up a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such tips are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission from the European space agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example comet interceptor) on a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it should either lurk on an unspoilt, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic of China, a first passenger aircraft from China United Airlines has landed on the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are scheduled to be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025, it is expected to be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's most recent prestige project is also called "starfish" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Even during the construction period, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the – and much smaller – capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been postponed until now. In Beijing, however, a first passenger plane landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the UK Space Agency is dreaming of. It's supposed to make this supersonic-speed flight possible for the 2030s, a special engine (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely do this," said agency director Graham Turnock to the station. "We're talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work more closely with Australia. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis is currently taking about 20 hours. The only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred during the launch of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, killing all 109 passengers. Last year, US aircraft maker Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on his homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus made possible the "next generation of truly reusable frame travel equipment".
Uproar in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down potential leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday in front of employees of the U.S. embassy at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past "a bit different" from today.
This was considered an attempt at intimidation against tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media broadcast audio recordings from the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted outrageously to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump. Their allegations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence agent who is making serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. On great public pressure, the whistleblower's statements were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the US president "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country interferes in his behalf in the US election in 2020.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is in the lead in the race for the Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone call: senior government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been prepared. However, this had been removed from a generally intended database after the interview by lawyers from the White House and stored instead in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the overseas intelligence agency CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called whistleblower had spread second-hand information that had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there might be no tippers or spies at all.
However, as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have given whistleblower information, indignation ensued. Nancy Pelosi, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, reacted alarmedly and complained that Trump's statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
Several committees in the House of Representatives have been conducting various investigations against Trump and its surroundings for months. In the face of Ukraine's accusations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with new force in order to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said Adam Schiff, head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresentation of things and again demanded the resignation of the chairman of the committee. Trump regularly insulted Schiff and had demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. officials from the security and foreign policy sectors, most of whom were under democratic, but also under Republican presidents, were behind the Democrats' investigation into possible impeachment in a statement published on Friday. If the allegations were true, Trump's "abuse of power" would be "unscrupulous," it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision on a real impeachment would be taken in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore small. So far, no U.S. President has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW works council: jobs are being "slowly" reduced
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the car manufacturer around. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be reduced at the car manufacturer if it is practically proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, job security is valid until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which are not actually in the disposition, are "slipped" by another way - thus passing by the official course. Thus, regular jobs that are free would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the works council had no possibility of forcing the reinstatement. Meanwhile, in many places, there was a shortage of personnel, the increase in work density, the concerns about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants would increase. This also increased the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. Of VW, it was only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide even more and manage new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "We are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof, especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the imminent trade war between the US and China."
There are already successes on this path: for example, this year, production costs per vehicle will fall for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Journalists have told Tostmann that the production time for Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. According to our newspaper, VW does not mention exact production time figures.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg parent plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies internally that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. However, in 2018 the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new WLTP fuel consumption and exhaust gas testing process.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are to be "perspective" in Wolfsburg. This is to make the bundling of golf production possible in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant delivers the golf production through the conversion to the site for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of the Gulf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now resting on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build up e-mobility, the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburger should remain for the time being.
Forced to Prostitution with Voodoo: Sentenced to Traffickers
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to probation and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The accused had taken young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. To force their obedience, the Nigerians who wanted to leave had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest in their homeland.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought to inflatable boats across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to work off the alleged smuggler costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, the wages were completely reduced.
The defendants - four men and two women - admitted that the young Nigerians had been imprisoned and subsequently distributed to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and psychologically difficult to do," said judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were really disgusted."
The judgments are in commercial and gang-like infiltration of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn a permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union UFO once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union "will inform on 14 October about the industrial action measures in the LH Group", said Ufo's board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with Ufo for months. It is also a question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against it. "I consider it unlikely that a second court would see the matter completely differently," said UFO board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have Ufo's status as a union reviewed by the court. The company argues that the union has not set up a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing union head Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about its leadership, the UFO had suspended an initial vote on strikes by cabin personnel at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is now to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the aim is to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the ErzkonservativeKingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oilfield. In the wake, national oil production collapsed dramatically, the oil price surges rising. It should take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) on which she can be seen in a white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married in church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the "yes" word in a New York registry office a year ago. There was no big party at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Mechin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use in the search. The cause of the accident still has to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, reported the World Nature Conservation Union IUCN in Brussels on Friday. It investigated the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of risk and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "hazarded", "highly endangered", "threatened from extinction" and "deceased in nature" to "extinct". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
rowan and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, especially Eberesschen (Sorbus) are threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary horse chestnuts. They have been regarded as "hazardous" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat in addition to a fungus is the Balkan mini moth. Since the 1980s, it has spread from south-eastern Europe across the continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrubs and mosses also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one fifth of moss and moss and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and were an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
34 people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to information, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have therefore been damaged. Since the earthquake of the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake-prone. Below the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicentre was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
On Tuesday, a earthquake of 4.6 had already shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced this on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is incredibly excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, Miami will be ready.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I will perform with another Latina". She could hardly wait to "show what we girls can do on the world's biggest stage".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to be on one of the largest stages in the world alongside another artist, representing Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "Queen" were on a stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently dropped audience numbers: this February the spectacle in the USA attracted the fewest viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
The half-time show of the past Super Bowl had been upsetting in advance: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform last February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen to his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been disunited since March 2017 and has no longer played any NFL games. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to find the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook expensive. High depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans threatens. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write down a total of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report.
Creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciations of between £900 million and £1 billion and lenders of between £ 550 and £825 million. The amounts actually to be written off are likely to be at the upper end of the ranges, one expert told the paper.
The extent to which the creditors' losses will actually be in the end will be demonstrated after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this case did not exude too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 planes of Thomas Cook in the UK were "old" and many of the properties were in bad locations. The most money could probably be recovered with the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Rackete is said to have brought alleged murderers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any secure information about it," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they had on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had illegally taken migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29 and rammed a ship from the Italian financial police. On that day the three suspects were reported to have arrived there. The captain is under investigation for aid to illegal immigration.
USA warn federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," said Pai to the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continues the FCC CEO. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of trust" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" using its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It would be "very difficult to imagine that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief added.
To the Chinese company Huawei he accuses close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque. The employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai to the "Handelsblatt".
The US has evidence that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks in order to promote the position of the US.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, local residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky above a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened on Friday as a precautionary measure, the responsible prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still the risk that after the erasure smell spreads, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture 240 firefighters as well as 90 policemen and gendarmes were in operation at the place of fire.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the Lubrizol company, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are monitored in particular. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The Prefect of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that no "high toxicity" was detected in samples at first. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river dams were built against pollution, the Prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning around 2.40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French economic and finance minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest and now, the sooner the better," said Le Maire at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year on Thursday evening.
The eurozone economy was weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions".
Le Maire said that action would have to be taken by those states that have budgetary leeway for more investment with a view to Germany, among other things.
France has no room for manoeuvre, the Minister added, referring to its country's high public debt, which is more than 98 percent of its gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilised" and "sinked", said Le Maire.
In recent years, appeals have repeatedly come from France to Germany to make more public investments to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday foresees tax reductions of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is reacting to the protests of the yellow vest movement, among other things. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids the question of Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "Capitulation Act" passed by the Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics fear, however, that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician deviates from this possibility.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is keeping a low profile on whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by Parliament, which is precisely what is to prevent it. On a question, Johnson simply told journalists that his government would abide by the law in force.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said that he felt the political disputes over Brexit was a "walk in the park" and was confident that the EU's intended exit would still come about: "We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave (note: from the EU), don't worry," said Cummings in the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign prior to the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in Downing Street, the British government headquarters. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Prime Minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders front woman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film."
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, several hundred of them are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always the focus: her husband Paul - as perhaps never seen before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they lived a normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland. Mary McCartney said, according to the BBC, that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it hasn't always been cleaned up with the McCartneys either.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The shots of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always catching the right moment. "She just knew she had it," Paul said in the Eshun essay.
That's where the light, the composition, the cut-out and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to everything anecdotal, where landscapes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the recently released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had "reduced due to US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not abide by the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
U.S. government wants to limit reception of refugees
On Thursday, the U.S. Department of State declared that the annual ceiling for resettlement programmes should be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are in danger, as stated in the statement of the Foreign Ministry. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, should receive a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The programme, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettlements them in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Even the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was close to 85,000.
Aid organizations were appalled at the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee. The US would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States, both legally and illegally. According to his own statements, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Get close to a snitch"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever told the informant who accused him of abuse of power, "comes close to a snitch," said Trump, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several US media reported this in agreement.
So Trump spoke to employees of the United Nations mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This is close to a spy." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers evaluated the latter remark for a possible allegation of the death penalty. Democrats strongly criticised Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, wrote the chairmen of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Supervision in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office in order to request interference from another country in the U.S. election in 2020 in a complaint that has now been published. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump advised him to open an investigation against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informant are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Time and again people try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. They regularly capsize their boats, often too small. Seven migrants have now been killed in the sinking of an inflatable boat, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the sinking of an inflatable boat. Among the deaths were also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek coast guard. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inouses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inouses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not known from which states the migrants come. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in far too small boats. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route last year.
The Who cancel concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to an uneasiness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the gig on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston, his voice failed. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should let it go while it's still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey could "not speak now". Townsend promised the audience that he would get his money's worth at a reparation concert.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver scheduled appearances The Who canceled. They are to be caught up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small start-up to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office tenant WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. A few days ago, the company had sold founder Adam Neumann as head, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reports that WeWork has stopped the completion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly off the market.
WeWork offers large office space in the long term and rents it to members in small units in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far WeWork burns money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year the company recorded a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone the rental costs by renting ever new large areas should have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is now supposed to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, over the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone made it possible to increase the demand for offices in New York more than the newly launched space during that time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, London is where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in the best location.
In the UK capital, too, the balance on the real estate market could move noticeably without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building purchased last year by Sparkassen fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billions of dollars. Despite the long-term lease agreements, they do not have access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork usually takes place through subsidiaries, so-called special purpose vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 poachers who had fished illegally in the waters have been arrested, according to the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB of the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them injured. This time, there were no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters. There the coastguard of Russia sails patrolling according to its own information to protect its marine biological resources. In the re-checks 30,000 octopus were discovered. In addition, according to the data, three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the coastguard recorded a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018
The Russian fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there for some time in 2019, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow mesh synthetic nets that were banned in Russia. They would also bring small living beings out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed. Nor would the ships themselves comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured during the previous week's arrests. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean later died of his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
USA impose ban on entry against former President Castro
The U.S. has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs explained this in a message on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he presided over a system in which thousands of Cubans were arbitrarily arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As head of the armed forces, Fidel Castro, the brother of the late revolutionary leader, was also co-inflicted by the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, of human rights violations there. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo tweeted.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had made entry bans, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle has raged for months between the government and the opposition. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro's government to bring it to its knees and to bring the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is regarded as one of Maduro's closest allies. Venezuela's socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are expected to start due to the time shift before the protests move across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
It is relatively unclear how large the worldwide support for this Friday will be after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg took part in the Swedish parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This has led to the Fridays for Future movement within a short time. The climate protests are mainly involving students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe. According to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York about a month ago after a two-week transatlantic trip with a high seas race. She had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke strongly to the heads of state and government of the Earth. In her home country of Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, which means a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow, the Tass agency, on Thursday. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also applies to burning candles. Even grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Attack against cybercriminals - Investigators elevate servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal transactions on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel, through which internationally active criminals operated their machinations.
This was reported by the Procuratorate General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night during a major action. The Darknet is a screened part of the Internet.
Clients of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which investigators smashed in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General's office.
Such a hoster was first raised in Germany, it said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access campaign with the support of special units such as the GSG9 there were searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climatic protests 的 Who are Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. All the more surprising that a 16-year-old girl of all time holds the mirror in front of the power people of that time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and leads young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to fight for a more just world. At that time, he was able to win a crowd of young people for himself and persuades them to cross the sea in order to enter the promised country, just as Greta Thunberg recently made his way to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side to this? Why does it need a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold itself extensively, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Even well-proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action was very good in the media around the world and a lot of money flows thanks to the impressive action.
This is where the spirits split: Is it morally correct to enrich themselves financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic for certain groups of people to work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. That is why it can make sense to critically question the seemingly pious plans of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers' guesses have been confirmed: A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was christened after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-made telescope and further observation confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet, which does not originate from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind, which was sighted when passing through.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the Comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the Comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel track that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before this happens, astronomers will be able to observe it in detail, because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach, which means that it can be investigated from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on Comet 2I/Borisov arouse hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be between 2 and 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again asteroids occupy the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid rushed past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson appalled by brother
Boris Johnson becomes more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges with clear words the warlike language of the prime minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to upgrade - at least verbally. During Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, the opposition was deeply indignant, and in the meantime, other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother was using words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, extended, quartered, tarred and feathered." She thought that this was extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had competed in the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
In particular, she found that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly House of Commons member who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum on leaving the country. The best way to honor her memory was to go through Brexit, said Boris Johnson in the House of Commons. "It is very tasteless to refer to a Member of Parliament who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the extreme right camp, which felt strengthened "by this kind of language". For those who mourned for her, it was very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately and resolutely for what you believe in - no matter what your view is. But never to "demonise the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory deputy. "In recent months, I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that "is not worthy of this country." In a joint statement, they declared: "In the past few days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong signal in the year of its 100th anniversary: In the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl two women appear with Latino roots. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which is celebrating its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," explained Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the German cinemas as of November in the drama "Hustlers".
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests in the USA is eagerly awaited every time. This year, many also consider the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sports event and also a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. Usually watch far over 100 million TV viewers at the NFL final, it is also extremely popular in Germany.
Last year there were political controversy in the run-up. The reason for this was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up at the national anthem in protest against police violence against blacks, and had been hard on by US President Donald Trump, among others. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl performance - among them Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber ascribes to Egypt's rulers: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men, who had an influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt, have spent the past week both abroad. One of them floated again at Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-General, who in 2013 dismissed the Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisis's action against political Islam and had not lost a syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week when Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had "no reason to worry," Sisi said at the airport in the microphones of state television. "The Egyptians are not misled."
Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he escaped the access of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor for only a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the voice of tone that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tea rooms: with his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president indulges in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After having demonstrated thousands against his rule for the first time since Sisi's grip on power last week, and having arrested nearly 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would dare on the streets. However, there were isolated minor protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the village of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos were not verified independently at first. Security circles said that the police had stopped the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators broke banners with a portrait of the president last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the down roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed due to "maintenance work", most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where in 2013, supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Mursi entrenched themselves until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a grand rally here for the president.
Mohamed Ali caused these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers." But as a retreat, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to trust blindly the speed information of the providers. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of abnormalities.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer centre Bayern.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated", the consumer center Bayern points out on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable time limit of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance. This is best done in writing by registered mail.
If this does not affect anything even after several requests, customers can terminate and possibly also demand damages. However, if success is not achieved, only the legal action can be taken.
First High-Level Republican for Investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has spoken in favour of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this is going from here is determined by the facts that are being determined," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the dismissal of the President - is taken.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown any discomfort. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump's policy on several occasions, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Another Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland should go on.
After "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Several U.S. media report this in agreement. According to this, the release of the movie is already scheduled: In the USA, the film will start on July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. Me and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue working on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidey-Verse. You never know what the future will bring".
But what is the sudden good news? It is said that Sony Marvel has made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of incoming Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode, there have been many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked for many years in the series, have been paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections include spoilers to the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a last farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his prison term.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. Whether he has actually thrown himself a skirt, the bewildered Harvey from the groom wants to know, only to then notice snippically: "Louis, you are not the prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in boat crash
A baby and four other children drowned while captivating a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coast guard reported on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inouses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route last year. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to inform Turkey about "what the refugee situation is like", said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help cope with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson for the European Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned journey with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increased figures finally raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, which allows the EU to send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally via Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications on the Greek side is difficult due to a lack of personnel. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are waiting for almost 29 400 people. The worst situation is in Lesbos: 5200 Migraten are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, there have been so many, reports the State Radio.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Above all, the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and resulted in increased heart attacks. People with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are particularly affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photopanes
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian green boss holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed nevertheless. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held the reusable coffee cup with metal straw in her hand. On the party's website she was shown on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published before and had also been distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a cuddly (papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produced Fake News to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau has become increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and stimulated the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cup".
May showed herself shocked and asserted on her blog that she had not known anything about this action. To underline this, she posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she made it right, was made of bamboo. She always had it in her hand. A spokesperson of the party said that it was only a matter of storing the party logo in the picture, and not to cover up something. Of the photo can only be seen on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and asked herself at the same time about her over-committed team: "If they want to edit a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face so I look younger?"
The German Greens also got into Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the boss of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: life-long flight ban on Cathay
Jaqueline Ng is said to have been promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific by mail. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Get a spontaneous upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how it should not be done: A self-explained influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way out, Jaqueline refused to upgrade, despite showing an e-mail in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered her an upgrade. The letter wants the influencer to have received from an airline marketing employee, while the airline accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman showed the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at the airport JFK were skeptical: they were following up at the headquarters. And in fact the employee, from which the mail allegedly originated, denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was confirmed also by the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight agent to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had refunded her the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. Furthermore, the airline's terms and conditions state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now hires a lawyer.
Oil prices drop according to report on armistice in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday noon. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen was the trigger for the fall of the course. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had put five percent of the world's oil production to a halt. Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had denounced the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blamed Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement were to be reached, one could concentrate on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw material strategy department at Saxo Bank of the news agency Bloomberg.
Oil prices are continuing its downward movement over the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost almost $59, Brent nearly $65.
Most recently, Bloomberg had reported on insiders that after the attack in mid-September, repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia progressed faster than expected. Accordingly, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Most recently, there were several press releases based on insiders reporting rapid progress made by Saudi Aramco, a state-owned oil company, in the repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and is avoiding negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was suggested in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recently granted clearance to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is further anchored, shipping manager Erik Hånell informed Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the US announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian archenemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and Great Britain had at times significantly increased oil prices in recent weeks.
Allegations against Trump Are Growing
In the affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up charges against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have made intensive efforts to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "coverage." Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea considers Trump and Kim's third summit questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute. The sense and the chances of success of such a meeting are questionable because of lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US had done nothing to implement the summit's decisions in the previous year, said the North Korean Foreign Ministry's advisor. He also criticised intensified US sanctions and the joint US-South Korean military maneuvers. However, he hoped for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump to bring it closer again.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit would bring with Kim before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, they both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. In doing so, they agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Gun manufacturers should help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry in Angola symbolically set off and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue splinter protection vest. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place Dirico he set up the ignition circuit. At a safe distance the explosive device exploded. Looking towards the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later demanded in front of running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but which did not help to get rid of them, to commit themselves to help".
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an early cut in interest rates, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt's speculations about an early cut in interest rates by the Bank of England (BoE) are increasing to sterling. On Friday, the British currency reduced by up to 0.4 percent to $1,2269.
Sales were triggered by statements by the central banker Michael Saunders, who talked about a cut in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered to be an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the brokerage house ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by Brexit-Hickhack without directly signaling a cut in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details on the doping scandal in Russia are coming out - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and even at the beginning of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014 systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed. After that, the Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. After an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee let around 270 athletes compete under neutral flag, 168 Russian athletes were at the start of the winter games in February 2018. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer even the World Cup with the host took place in Russia as a participant.
Positive findings missing
The following September, the Wada picked up the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the samples in question. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the Friday interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung". "We have noted numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those that it received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing, which were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organisation to hold on to Russia's ban. At the World Cup in Doha 30 Russian athletes under neutral flag start. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in place and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the re-blocking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
