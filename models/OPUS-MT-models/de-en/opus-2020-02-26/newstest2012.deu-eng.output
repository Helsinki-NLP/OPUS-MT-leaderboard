No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused to propose to abolish, as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code, the section on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the imprisoned minister of ex-premier, was rejected by the Members at the second reading of the motion for a mitigating the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of a supposedly harmful contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet final, and in December the appeal of the convicted persons will be brought before the court.
Timoshenko himself described the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial caused suspicion of bias of the court.
The request to remove Section 365 from the Criminal Code on the basis of which the Minister of Execution was sentenced was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council confessed itself to the customary law of Sharīʿa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you cut your hand short.
Women, too, should quickly forget about emancipation, any apostates of faith will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society from each other's competing tribes will be united by the Koran.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that would be hard to imagine and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their apologies, it may be only the fact that NATO's air attacks were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only participated in a firefight, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
This is a worry for the locals - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But does the oil companies also get the black gold at a mock price without occupation?
It is unlikely, and so the West can at last rightly boast of its selflessness in terms of protecting human rights.
If this does not destroy the Sharīʿa representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm was blowing through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, with Germany and France growing.
But the bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, compared with 0.4% in France.
Both countries also corrected their data for the second quarter, where Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France acknowledged a slight decrease of 0.1% (original figures only indicate stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend of the slowdown in economic performance was confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds reached 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to its critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, votes are being voiced that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The soccer selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well laid goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal of Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz tracked the ascension game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happily 1-0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the football championship.
They were also able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half because of the Czech team's precise defensive game.
The unlucky birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who lost two huge chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will join the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that local football will receive a bonus of around 200 million.
From the first minutes, quite militant football was played.
Both teams combined for a long time and so was played mainly around the midline.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team remained and the wide tees before the penalty area were successfully averted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the building on Tuesday noon and then announced their death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to make it clear that they were willing to protect their country's core programme, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seemed to have long since abandoned its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, there is talk about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attack aimed at largely paralyzing Iran's nuclear program, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan would also be targeted from the centre of Isfahan.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: it does not eat breakfast and eat sausage for dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have been proven - obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the milieu in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more frequently on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the day before the Enlightenment Action under the motto "Adiposity is no coincidence".
In families with fat children, sports are not exactly one of the favorite activities, however, the majority of today's students are also concerned - only 15 percent replied that their parents find themselves at least once a week time for active exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools all over the Czech Republic surveyed.
This was already the second year of the "Adiposity is no coincidence" action, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the Unilever Society.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed reported eating breakfast-second-breakfast-dinner-vesper dinner five times a day - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative little things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils' families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast for themselves.
Worst was the finding that every tenth family does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey showed that the families of overweight children often consume unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own meal schedule out of the possibilities offered according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, pasta won just in front of poultry.
Pulses almost didn't like the children at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was also very low.
Towards health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In many cases, the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the enlightening lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence" showed a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition", the results of the project state.
This was obvious, for example, in the case of sweet sodas, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also checked in the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had a bit moaned that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I didn't even know what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the test gets, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not a single man attends the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure.
And that's most of us.
Some have too short a neck, others have too young a figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to conceal broad shoulders visually, to extend the neck or to cast out the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to put on a female type like Jennifer Lopez - with big breasts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-emphasised, without having to seem too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have a piece of custom made.
I'm sure you won't regret this, because good sitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the bars, which always slips up and down, stands down in the waist, etc.
In turn, young figures can allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, buffaloes, applications, embroidery or raffling.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad that I have a whole week to let everything go thoroughly through my mind.
And yet I'm afraid that it's almost impossible to do it in the light of the assignment.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity, for which she is supposed to design suitable outfits - daily clothing and evening robe.
In doing so, we should take into account the current look, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress Miranda Kerr" you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
On the inside, I am cheering, because this is much better for me personally than to put on Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which in recent times has probably increased to a hundred kilos (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then graphically process them.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, such as trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday talk, filled with information about figure types, was spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
Stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And sent in stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put heels on it and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to roll up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, the following advice came to me: "First, you must know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why we have to worry about all these doctrines, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see very different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he ultimately photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to reckon with all this when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný confirmed that image and styl sometimes make up half of the success.
You only need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us to a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you just need to google to find out with certainty that the tabloids write that the corresponding celebrity has gone up or down again, etc.
Jan and Mario told us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just had to focus on fashion and then "reassemble" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate primarily with the people he styles and he must be a wise psychologist.
Appreciate people without browsing and standing up to their opinions.
"If any manager ordered us to sift her closet and add nice pieces, then we can't clean out the whole closet and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can contribute," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So a bag that you button at the waist and carry with you all the necessary proprieties.
Besides such clear things as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are ruffled at the back, if it is too large (pins or other clamps are forbidden to break the fabric) and of course sewing gear.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to put shoes under properly.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, one can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We were stuck and stuck to each other...
With scissors you must not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to do it skillfully.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me - to devote oneself to styling on a professional level is not a child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree journey is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettantic errors to the routine journey to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions in large part, what good is it, if obviously no one wanted to do a little more?
Even before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already year old game series "Need for Speed" again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitting passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you're used to at NFS, in the end, much is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially it's quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of a basically incomprehensible laziness of game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will take place on a different track and that the individual stages will take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment's impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape is visually very pleasant.
Every now and then, atypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the visibility.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful not to get spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classical race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also involved, who wants to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack escapes from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (probably only three).
In the end, this is more to the advantage of the thing, because this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned one of the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model moves in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, it cannot be said that it is bad.
If you're looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed racer will continue to do quite well with the local driving model, although one could find better with the competition.
Until then, everything will be fine.
Real problems do not appear until after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
It's hard to expect a game of this kind to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea of how the car behaves before impacting any object, then obviously not everything is all right.
Typical example: In the tight overtaking or passing of cars, one "strips" the other car only slightly in some places, in other, almost identical situation, however, one gets into the slingshot and turns wild pirouettes.
Or the car's gonna go to waste.
Thanks to the Restart system, it doesn't matter any more, it's annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
Once you've exhausted it, it's all over again.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the rest doesn't even help, so nothing else helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to pass through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Elsewhere you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate place, whether you are first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent is passing by two cars in front of one, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place and here again without regard to the time.
The craziest thing is to finish the game on the long bridge that you pass in opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously get one out of here on hell.
And if he's in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you drive your own car there a few times in Klump.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly avoids the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is overall quite entertaining and in places also so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what is "guilty" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in such a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car during the race.
One must not overlook the petrol stations on the route, because it is here that one can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient, which one has just.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American saloons for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
The task mode (challenges) goes hand in hand with the mode of the game history - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from the history.
Here, there are not only medals, but also points of experience for one's own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to get to the higher driver level, different objects have to be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected at the same time to the online Autolog function, which compares, among other things, its own results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car into a subway tunnel (because of me), where you race in the dark on the tracks for a long time (because of me).
On the speedometer there are numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (because of me), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives you uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial office we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
All the more annoying is that in some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this is particularly true of accidents involving a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to reach a scale as wide as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack was created a lá "something from everyone" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? Feelings are rather mixed.
If the game weren't reduced by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have asserted with the chest tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems somehow unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but you should be prepared to see these mistakes with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with singing ensembles of the Karlsuniversität
For the third time now, Festa Academica has offered the opportunity to combine World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this with music experience.
In the course of the festival present themselves to the twenty specialist and university choirs.
The festival focuses on the two concerts that will take place on November 17th.
"Charles University has a large share of the festival."
"Among the participants is also the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies, and the Festival Committee includes the rector Václav Hampl," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organisational team.
The festival's absolute highlight is the public concert by Fachschulchörer, which will take place on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the famous Czech jazz musician Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evenings the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Student Sametu) takes place in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, in which also university choirs perform, choirs of the Charles University are not excluded.
Festa Academica sets itself the goal of not only celebrating World Student Day worthy and commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but of presenting choral music at the highest level to the public and promoting creative cooperation between young people.
The main organiser is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, Lord Mayor of Prague and Václav Hampl, Rector of Charles University, took over the patronage of the entire event.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to festive concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student Happanings, Matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the various institutions out of hand."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth down and everyone to get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, started her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, she showed how seriously she takes the motto "understandable and open about Europe", in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism became loud that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who couldn't stand such a role, but I have to say that it took everyone's breath to see how well he took care of the matter.
"He is a person who is able to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? What number should I call?", as an important step towards the unification and better legibility of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil-suppliers Quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and have also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was described as a great negative, which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was rather hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget needs to be approved, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be more and which will be less supported - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminds us of her own slogans that she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's greyish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How am I supposed to know, as a citizen, whether they really are crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes in Brussels, or whether someone really wants to ban us from the quarries?
She would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics who perceive the negative side of the matter more than the positive side of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
Many factors are to blame, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and there's a Slovak nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what do you put your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and at the same time makes a pretty sour face.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU is expecting tough rules for Member States' budget policies in the future.
It sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much more realistic than a "European federation".
"Here we have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only the countries that want it and those who don't want it should stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately amounts to a strong "Europe of different speeds", Ms Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also commended the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole must be discussed by all member states and not only by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to search for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution; it is known as a modern company, although a century has elapsed since it was founded.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already spoke of the slogan that countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark for the future giant's life (and, at the same time, the title of the company's internal magazine, which IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen's thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for an entire century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and also society over the course of our first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
In the 1930s, Watson was already working on social care for his employees - in a way similar to that of the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid vacations, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out pay system for the best newcomers and traders.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the very beginning, the company was brilliant in promoting talent - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM picked up any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan that Palmisan will replace at the head of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with the help of technologies," added George Colony from consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - called "Big Blue" in the states of its logo because of its family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
IBM owns the most patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or the floppy diskette.
With approximately $220 billion in market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (just after Apple), and for the first time since 1996 it overtook Microsoft.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with the own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on forward movement, so you cannot emotionally tie yourself to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, leaving them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM's profits are largely driven by services, software and hardware, each accounting for one fifth.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than 50 per cent was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-absorbing assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment volume in the middle of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM survives today's crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutters to world flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch office in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for IBM was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous card clocks to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who also served as Chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competitor Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader shadowed even IBM's founders - Watson's ideas are still based on the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash registers.
In the first four decades of Watson's leadership, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars, and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the head chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped guide NASA's flights into space - Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, the man's famous flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that defined the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of "Smart Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. in order to improve the situation in transport and in urban administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932 IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a top research team of world-level that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become her lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová offered the singer I. Bartošová shelter in her own house, she probably wouldn't have even dreamed of how she would end up with her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to Żíčany after 30 days at her urging, Joseph went with him immediately.
Yes, he even confessed publicly that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the run pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door for him, Joseph has so far carried with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta, nothing will change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'll make the purchases."
"I talk to Darina normally, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to seek a new love, he does not want to prevent it.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all responsibility.
What about you?
When you ask the men to call some typical female virtues, they always shake a few immediately out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we review a few immoralities that make the men shed blood in their veins?
Buying addiction
Is their husband accusing them of being addicted to buying?
Do you have to buy at least one battle a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more with promotions?
Then I guess your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite under control.
But hand on heart, which woman can stand to stroll through a clothing store in search of a good-fitting outerwear and not all (in all possible colour combinations) to try themselves out in the cabin?
Even if shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times you've told your husband - you better stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that sound familiar to you?
Yes?
Then I guess you're one of the women who's really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when your wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger gender is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints women are becoming more and more intolerable.
Order and cleanliness first
It's a battle against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wiping tiles and dust, scrubbing the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you insult your partner because he tramples on the clean tiles again with dirty shoes, you scolded the children, because the just scrubbed sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, when polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", you should know that you must not overdo anything and that the order and cleanliness of family life are not the first priority.
In the end, this immeasurable cleanness can also harm mutual relationships and, above all, the peace of life in the family.
Stitches
"Smooth sneakers come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you mustn't be surprised that that's putting him on the brink.
Of course that's not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, because behind their backs are tugged or even slandered or alliances are forged.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to cheer through such topics as who, where, with whom, how, and why.
I guess each of us women has some harmless gossip and gossip in store.
Hand on heart - this is probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with gossips of the greatest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which pose a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
In the NHL's Monday game, Jaromír Jágr played a major role in Philadelphia's 5-3 win on the Carolina ice with two assists and is now again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The winner of the survey of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was Claude Giroux in both cases, who added an assistance and was declared the best player in the match.
Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček also recorded two assists in the same game.
Jágr claimed after the game journalists that he had prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"Even before the game, I tell him that he's doing a hat trick today."
I had a feeling about that."
"Again and again such a feeling comes over," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the Puck behind the Hurricanes gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the whistle of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
In concrete terms, Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but surely he's one of the best three," Jágr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have thought in my life that I'd be playing with an ice hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm so happy."
"I'm cutting my game towards me."
"All these years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the skewer turns around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina made the game into a drama - with the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who got himself out of a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication, in which he was in excess of two against one successful.
"Excellently, Pronger was still operating in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up the ride and (read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the last match of the match from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also lost their lead in the Penalty shooting 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not transform one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team probably the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defenders to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the encounter with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec prevented thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the Jets' goals, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters participated.
Evolution of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time the travel agencies sold mainly only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West only chosen ones were allowed at that time.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a ČSSR citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to accept huge queues or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the thing had not yet worked out.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a commitment to foreign exchange.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays domestically, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend homes and datschen - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox that is no longer known today is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czech - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, foreign exchange obligations were lifted in neighbouring Western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept in the park tent when travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension back then?
A typical feature of trips abroad by Czechs at that time was a luggage compartment packed with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of life and thus also the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to prepare regularly after 1997 for charter flights, which, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts, made air travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had foreignless payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travelling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-official" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to distant sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are coming directly from the Czech Republic.
Every year, the 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely included our country among the world's advanced countries.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita for a single holiday stay, including the costs at the resort.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman, threatening that Ivan Hašek's successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there has been no agreement as to which electoral system is to be elected.
Without these, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, inviting his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old querels broke out again between the two chambers of association, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on 16 September when the new president was to be selected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People's House in the Smíchov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiations had no result and this was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote at the plenary assembly - only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries endowed with a power of attorney.
On this single point, agreement was reached at least in part, to which the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law contributed, whose opinion was that representation on a proxy basis was not acceptable.
However, disputes over the electoral order continue.
The Executive Committee also no longer clarified the matter, at which meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the Chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is supposedly willing to compromise on the fact that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side in turn insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote counting.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer have any meaning at all, this mode would call into question the entire bicameral concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would like it best not to bend the electoral order, but to vote according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even though it is clear that the statutory electoral order is best suited to Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsense substitutes are devised, as at the last general meeting," explained the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself from Pelta in his statements.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national football team for the European Football Championship today would certainly help to calm the moods."
"When football first rides on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says Jablonec's official, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both on a professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "bend" the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a further blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense ultimately wins," said Rajchl.
Just - a lot of time for the agreement of all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the generality of football will be complete until the qualifying match.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, was not able to take off in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance and so one was looking feverishly for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee still to the venue of the Barrage match.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have moved the divided parties within the country's largest sports federation to reach an agreement.
In fact, there is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the trustworthiness of Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which is intended to give Czech sport a new direction following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the chairman's position because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, head of the Pilsner football team, had been able to make up a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have gotten involved in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
"I spoke to some people in question personally."
"It's hard to believe that some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should hold the chair.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and Czech football would not go ahead at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever business man, would be twice as bad for football," said Paclík.
He also points out that some time ago Pelta's name fell in connection with telephone intercepts to investigate a corruption affair, but Pelta emerged from it as a criminal offence.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to (ch.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paklík, who saw his earlier statement that "he would sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta became chairman", but he was a little more relaxed.
However, if Paclík was to win in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is true of another candidate – Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the October general meeting, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could think of him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as a manager."
"I don't have my nose in matters of which I don't understand anything," said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September when he was at the head of the referee commission's dismissal with LuŻěk Macela, replacing Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he has grown up in the role of the chairman of the association.
And he relies on his skills in running private companies, since last summer he has also been head of Pilsen, which celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football milieu and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which degenerates into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to Sparta's chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he would see the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political leaders for more money to flow from lottery tax to sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argumentation, but then they also have to say very clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner club also does not consider Paclík a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "cross-party".
Pelta in turn is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner club to a third party, in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new articles of association of the FAČR, which resulted in a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that, in the event of his election, he would stand up for the FAČR to receive new statutes that will in future rule out disputes over the electoral system from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse itself if the Czech election is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of financial resources in the event of his election.
He only decided at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting and so the two-month break might help him defend his ideas about the management of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also worked for many years with Sparta and on the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are due to the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, articles of association were approved at the June general meeting, which were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizen's Association that he used as a means of attracting delegates.
"If I should become chairman, I will accept this personally and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a matter of principle that he cannot be without," Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledges because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, which in turn did not leave any dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"His attacks, however, were depressing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"This is also why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed to his opponent, who probably remains true to his proclamations, which he already made in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest levels to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also strive to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the reverberations of the corruption scandal of last year."
"Right after that, I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football sector," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where nervousness is understandable due to the long anarchy.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really the only controversial point is how to vote in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility and will only win back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly upset many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that if you choose, you will begin to work hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football, and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selections, professional football, to professional football for young people."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to distribute the competences in the executive committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses with miles in every segment."
Many would not be delighted at this, because instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he had considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who don't constantly throw clubs between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people told me, however, that I should not give up, because otherwise others would."
"That's trust that you can't lose," he said.
Supposedly, he also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years, we've done a great deal of work, and I don't want to just throw that away."
"Processes have been launched that will probably only come into effect in a few years' time and I would hate to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't do."
"Behind him are above all people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the chosen."
I may be accused of some things, but not of being partial."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because everyone is doing well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl remarked.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even though some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then went up into the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Now that the head of Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has joined the fight for the position of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who also regards the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the band does not pull in one single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football to gain new confidence", he considers the second rival - Paclík a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question the fact that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
He would certainly not want to bend things in his favor," Rajchl judges his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pool in Ufo-Optik, magnificent pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike, you can rest your tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past one and a half years, one could not be missing in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Lying on the water at the back, she looked high in elaborately designed domes, swam towards marble putties waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it flying into her notebook - with some interesting details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true swim culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, says Meder - it's different only in the water.
Annoyingly, swim fans have to deal with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can inhale the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splatter in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders have bothered themselves, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all makes a desire for a leap into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in a rustic karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can see the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam room there is a window from which you can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
It steams from three shells open upwards in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strongly of heating oil that you hardly think you have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and its mud sticks to the skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
In contrast, one has counteracted the decline in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already passed this bath; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements, which date from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - not only because it was originally from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is obviously only a minor thing.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets examine raw material business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the CEO wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive prices up - and the banks therefore bear a co-debt on the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the gamers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit will be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Board of Management of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell us what the consequences are.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete decline.
Ackermann makes his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how ruthlessly banks today damage the general good."
Ackermann is now a top bank lobbyist especially in duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio that use money for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or with the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive Officer will not change to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses, he hardly has to care - that's what his successor had to do with it.
Any second would terminate raw material facilities
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey, for which the Institute Forsa interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
As a result, just eleven percent believe it legitimate that Deutsche Bank should offer investments that place a bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: according to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about quitting their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and decayed.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture is swarmed with clear shapes, glass halls, bold turns and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Tailfer is an apt and famous example for the 1958 Brüssler World Exhibition.
Dicker's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion at the next World Exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a bowl-like side building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof, rebuilt and opened a museum of the 20th century in 1962 - the "20s Haus" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect.
The new beginning was accomplished by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, art historian with a considerable career, among others in youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly implemented the conversion with politicians and monument protectors, she procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the eponymous foundation, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had carefully rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna at Dicker and the pavilion was for him a "very important place" where he had looked at the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already lost in generosity and ease when he moved to Vienna and its conversion.
In the current reconstruction, there were far bigger problems: the building was "an energy hurler," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridges steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light pit between house and street ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish brown rust protection shade.
And the theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found which is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion "that came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21 house is not in the wrong place, because there has been a stroke of urban planning: around the Swiss garden the completely new planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier" with office and residential buildings is being created.
And another stroke of luck may occur: the 21er Haus could get reinforcements from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourhood location in the Swiss garden.
Bahn plans a million-dollar winter crisis package
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance on the basis of an internal crisis plan that investments of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
The aim was to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees for snow removal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary turnouts.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with the government and industry, railway boss Rüdiger Grube warned of train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, rail had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For years, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the USA
After the tumult around boss Josef Ackermann comes new trouble from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar loss there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are now catching up with their past in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of having led cooperative banks to buy financial products with false promises; they had downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and tore the banks into depth.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the reception of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US co-operative banks and intervenes at Pleiten to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to get the resulting billion-dollar damage compensated.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also taken on other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on domestic loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even if the events have been a few years back, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to obtain redress or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of taking advantage of the two state-owned US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions of around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a lawsuit with FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that Frankfurters stand up for "substantial losses" without, however, mentioning a precise sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as undue and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than ten billion dollars in shares.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could only be poorly predicted.
However, he read IBM's annual reports and changed his mind about investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and providing computer systems for other companies' IT departments.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed in the US economic channel CNBC that he has been buying IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus grown to one of IBM's largest shareholders, accounting for 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that had made good profits even during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until then.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight railway, for example, with a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineer.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 own subsidiaries as well as shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and with wise investments had expanded it to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost inconceivable sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
After becoming aware of the Buffett investment, IBM's share rose by one percent on a pre-trade basis.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now resurrecting.
The murders of eight Turkish and a small Greek entrepreneur between 2000 and 2006 had a far-right background.
This news is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this is a long believed to be a ghost: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with right-wing extremist backgrounds.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the exposed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology going to live up again?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the radical right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted cautiously: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, the relationship had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media looks like a slap in the face: "Germany's 50th Gift" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which speaks the background to the murder series.
Also the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be avoided to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, that they had paid taxes and that their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German-Turkish internet forums the procedure of the police and their later search success is discussed extremely critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think much earlier of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some at least rhetorically show themselves ready for drastic means: "If there is still sluggishness here, the migrants have nothing left but self-defense and arming."
"It's going to be the best self-protection."
"The goodness of the Enlightenment and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network strongly depends on the inner peace in Germany," writes Selen.
The attacks by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s highlighted what it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger.
The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of us on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's arson attack, he sent a condolences telegram to the Turkish President, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - at that time Kinkel counted in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid.
All the more so as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive investigation and reassessment of the extreme right terrorism in Germany, we need open words this time.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been slipping from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now let a German judge it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would start an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS made the turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and had cheated around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been considered battered - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chair of the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
That's gonna be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather an economics professor and central banker, and would certainly have needed an induction period.
With one blow, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because on the one hand UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and on the other hand it has been slipping from scandal to scandal for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She combined the image of the concealed and solid, but also exhausted Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a huge number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed, on the one hand, $1.6 trillion more customers' wealth than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, it was advanced to the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich, explains: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank at that time."
"From today's point of view, how could I be so wrong?"
He was so wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something went wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which until then was considered a highly intellectual and just as ingenious banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had left.
The bank's investment division had gambled with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but some of them, who would have had their nose ripped over until shortly before: an intransparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so concealed that they didn't even know his name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the second-best-paid Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: in view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis, UBS was facing collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The Swiss National Bank purchased UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation issued six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times that of Switzerland's economic performance (see chart).
"Once again, we couldn't save UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to pay 780 million dollars as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions and penalties.
Thus, the UBS more or less openly acknowledged that they had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both key business areas: in investment banking through mis-speculation and asset management through aid to tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just when you thought that UBS would be able to do it again, this lousy dealer story follows: A single dealer is screwing up 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it is obvious that risk management in investment banking still does not work.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago begun to become guardians of the great fortunes of the world: not too big risks, but security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic the world might collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
Even the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Züricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main railway station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception room is accessed through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble-clad, in front are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a large sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has been suppressed by both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point – or revealed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two big banks.
The UBS had become far too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first brought it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"That Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs or about 45 billion euros in order to save the large bank that is facing bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
When talking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged to form a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and continued to grow.
The two different predecessor banks of UBS were complementary: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on wealth management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly the internationalized investment bankers came cheaply to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the time.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who worked up from the bank teaching to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Of course, pride came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, on which Group CEO Wuffli spent the same slogan over and over again: Goldman Sachs came from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, right up there.
Some steps had already been taken.
She played at the top in foreign exchange and stock trading.
Business consultants, however, who were commissioned, highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banker's language "Fixed Income", there was a huge gap to the largest banks.
UBS had gaps in US mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed securities on to American mortgage loans - but also retained risks.
Even when other banks were long looking for exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager at a time had to leave than the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Post at UBS became a slingshot seat and are still shaky.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all its obvious business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: an end to investment banking, a focus on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: he is to lead the UBS business permanently, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to drive the investment bank back to the level in the mid-nineties.
He's cutting 3500 jobs.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably already asking himself.
Publicly, he only says that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of Recession in Europe Burdens US Stock Exchange
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors to open the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unbeaten.
The strangled industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been considered half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were coming to the fore again, said Mark Luzchini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial values were on the sales slips.
The Dow-Jones index of the default values at the close of trading was down by 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax left with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
Industry in the 17 euro-zone countries has significantly reduced its production and is adjusting to the end of the upswing.
In September, enterprises produced two per cent less than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
The US investors were skeptical: "We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe would not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there were further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it was not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early in his view to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett overthrew a decades-old principle and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional company and initially had it quoted just under one percent higher against the trend in the trading process.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece, according to his own figures, and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Shares of the Bank of America declined by 2.6 percent significantly more than the market.
The house silvers up almost the rest of its shares in China Construction Bank, yielding 6.6 billion dollars.
With the net profit from the business, the institution wants to top up its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share gained 1.5 percent after the Group collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 777-type long-haul aircraft on Sunday and estimated the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
On the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1,38 billion shares increased by 630, 1913 in minus and 82 remained unchanged.
Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, local residents are becoming more and more uncomfortable about the dirt and noise of animals.
So far, a remedy against the "problem birds" is not in sight.
The experts at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian emptiness said that crows are no longer to be found in the cities.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the particularly protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are under conservation.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the trapping of the animals in bird traps and the beating with batons as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the burial, does nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer noted.
Nests with water splashed away or trees felled, often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals evade, large colonies split up and spread out elsewhere."
It is only possible to be buried as an exception to hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of burials of the animals from sensitive living areas and lock offers is conceivable in order to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens called for a completely different approach to the animals: "After all, we can bear a pimple on our face best confidently."
Jürgens had co-founded the Aschenberger Krähen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where signposts inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion about the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows do not only use tools to get to a delicious bite, but even produce their own tools as aids.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested four seed crows to see how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a scaffold to collapse with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly realized what size and shape a stone must have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with the beak.
However, the researchers had put wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows managed to do so immediately.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The Bosnians and Turks' hopes for a coup were over.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Led by the double successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship participation perfect after the 0-0.
The Czechs had a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back match with outsiders Montenegro, after the first match (2:0) had been a clear thing.
Croatia also had nothing to burn at the 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland scored a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other matches for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburger Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon Portugal caught a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters into the mesh for early guidance.
A good quarter of an hour later Nani showed his wide shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goal hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English champion Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not exceed the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penal area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the vice-champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European Champion of 1976 will go to the European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive already in the initial phase a Schrecksekunde.
Endman Petr Cech with a reflex at the last moment prevented a possible own gate by Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn of the penalty limit only slightly past the gate of Cech.
After the break the querlatte had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to almost certainly clear his place on the bank of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM final.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the pole in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the bouncer in the goal either.
However, after the shock, Croatia became more and more in control.
Even after the break, the Croats let nothing burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who made way for Ivan Perisic in Dortmund from the 62nd minute on, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni drives to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the first match, in the 32nd minute in the lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) compared for guests.
Ireland pushed the pace right from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible lead.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an accident in defense of Schließmann Pavel Londak Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to 1-0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly," announced co-chief Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees at present.
The number of branches of the world market leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP has so far been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are located in the boom country.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase its sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year the Walldorfers had saved around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the software provider's business, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Terror. A Story of World War I, Narrated in Nineteen Destinies" begins with a long list of main characters who come to your heart.
Here's a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which is the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he describes as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Terror" is almost the war experience of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives is flickering like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert view over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling of Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance.
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "were muddled up with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other published material.
Their life stories can be frightening or touching, but they are extremely vivid in the englunds of the collection of small moments that are lost in details.
Many of them deal with lack and help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and lastly served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes filled with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says about the war: "In spite of everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and pretending to mean such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own strengthened and stunned shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you distance yourself from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word shrewd and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a measure suit who kills while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is just as much frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves with a prostitute with a venereal disease in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like that," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eye, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way in which the war "uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly rather falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a nonfiction book.
I don't give it to you anymore.
But it's like he snatched away this page with the main characters in front of us with his book and lit us with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All the others initially believed that they would participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupation was handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called Chaos Training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," someone who is familiar with the orders said what a declaration as "exercise".
"The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then withdrew when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the Tuesday operation, including commandos from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and go out in the park, almost like commuters, so 1:00 a.m. at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do so when the least number of people are in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready for departure at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded news that sounded from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials rushed into the park in their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
The police said that no tents would be touched until 1:45 to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene if arrests were to become necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police president, said that this had happened for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from observing the police actions in the park, and they said that the officers' dealings were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars could have taken photos on Church Street on the west side of the park.
When the police moved westward through the big mess of the protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters took position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied up by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil Protection officials were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
According to the police, the evacuation was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, as he said, were due to "undue behaviour and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent official on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not guide the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In the event that they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the perimeter further and further around Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed that several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 o'clock south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Carers' union will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last possibility open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the city's worst paid employees and who had lost their jobs in a move on October 7, described the union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups last year to close the household gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing with the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the redundancies had been part of the budget, that they had passed in June.
A member of the city council fired back and told him that in the budget nothing specified that school assistants would be dismissed.
Officers of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will accuse Mr. Walcott and the City's Ministry of Education and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the City's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in the process of filing the lawsuit, and that their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft lawsuit submitted to the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in the city's poor districts to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school workers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were released.
The statement of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, states: "This is not a neighborhood of shaky parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was cut by 3.26% this year, and money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each school enrolment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even if "excess" in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six supervisors were dismissed, not transferred," says the draft lawsuit.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate decides a resolution under the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for its successful rebellion and US troops for their "murder."
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of two parties' support for their democratic efforts."
The language may sound innocent, but nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate so far.
This summer, both parties' legislators and the White House argued about the choice of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law passed in the Senate, and the Chamber overruled a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach within the mission, but not angry enough to pull the ground from under his feet for good.
Then the indecisiveness of the convention was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell in August under the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in the successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Panel, or will they split up the legislators, as the law of June did?
The final version comes up against the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every legislature of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or any other area that is currently being voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their amendments to the vote, although they have tried it often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this Congress and cover a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to both the Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners with the Republicans who want to polish up their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was passed in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the Budgetary Compensation Act.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limitation to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among the same sexes, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, is an ever-recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As zealous as members propose changes, they move much faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments to the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today's ones.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Done, but not defeated," says Giffords in the first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a short distance during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night. She sang alone for the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that of returning to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC News "20/20", she ran for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first TV interview after the January assassination in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "All right."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded shortly before the release of the couple's new book: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The Special has been following Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, she was seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see the congressmen singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily on therapy, said that she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on March 12th, he had read an article from a newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
Probable Sagittarius Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated," Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a cue, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedo stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, observed, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The harshly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are heaped with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say servicemen.
The public is increasingly acting as if the people in uniform were hurting her.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops were fighting in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, there are talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "wrathing, violent veteran" was hiding under the surface, said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the questioners were subtly asking if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the Americans' lack of interest in the war.
Performance on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely usual in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in case of rape in the military court.
If it doesn't happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Private Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman wiped aside her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claiming.
This week, on November 18th, Lyman and 27 other current and former military workers are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit they have brought against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to trial.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide appropriate jurisdiction according to the alleged attacks,
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically structured," she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in the position to eradicate the culture's retribution? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February, she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, submit many more lawsuits in order to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defense, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss suit.
The files of the court, which are available to Newsweek, state in detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 law of the Supreme Court, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active soldiers.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiff's military service," says the document.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In Iraq as well as in Afghanistan, soldiers' teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies for alleged promotion of a women's hostile atmosphere.
Independently of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is collecting a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that was given rape victims to release them from service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (Verwaltung der Kriegsveteranen), in which she accused her discriminatory practices in her dealings with entitlements to benefits for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were independently presented to Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
According to the Ministry of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported in 2010.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her assailant, which came from an incision on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, and during this hearing she was asked about the sex she had prior to the assault with her boyfriend.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I still remember the day the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought the labors were going to start. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his trial. That was my trial."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released dishonorably, so she does not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should make progress."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I've been a critic of the Feres doctrine all my life.
The military lags a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrent as liability.
He adds, "The odds are against them, but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms are made," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed a rampage in Norway in July, killing 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That's easy - you just have to log on to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British ideas factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hideout of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply have to use the site's advertising tool to accurately define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then turned them into add-ups, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their level of education, their attitude towards violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a quite new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters of right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and are angry about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800 percent over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this site people you don't normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have allowed them access," Bartlett says.
"On Facebook, all this falls away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their buzz on Facebook are significantly more prone to drinking problems than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that peer-level students, for example residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children that would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly taps into the data of its own population.
The website's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout at the 2010 interim elections, and a National Lucky Index (primarily data that only Facebook has access to – masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data base accessible to others for research purposes).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. To play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to provide your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was all about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social – and a lot of social life is still going on offline."
"Kalt und inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears before a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to contact his victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, having no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind lock and bar.
All of them participated with the aim of closing everything down.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like the fact that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist rather than of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the genius of technology as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings on the important markets, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who eagerly crafted diagrams - a man who believed that many managing directors were suffering from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat with jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, when 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, and looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in professional idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
It was only after Job's death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor extensive interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of meditation, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Crengely's questions and prompts him to respond more quickly to issues or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview somehow seems incredibly farsighted when jobs evaluate what other companies do to their mind right or wrong and represent their own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous appreciations of career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer who's on the move to magnificence is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"Over the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's made easy."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonished how costs were recorded - mostly started with "standard costs", which were calculated on mere assumption and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest possible extent.
How the Pope was fooled:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
A lot has been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, as they loop through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you got into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door," says Jobs giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled when they called the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were able to emulate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, they had to laugh at each other before the Pope himself came to the telephone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and called unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in an interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember sweeping arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs anticipated the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you do a better copier or printer, so what?"
They have the monopoly on shares, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are they] that ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly position, is eradicated by people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the whole computer industry.
You could've been ten times bigger if the Microsoft could've been in the 1990s...
You got the defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it comes down to the taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created and then trying to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they'd do fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws when court accepts case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically-divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case would be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care, which was passed by Congress last year, a law that became a catchword among conservative activists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to trigger the 2012 presidential fight, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be overturned will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-established group dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who challenged the law.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court discussed the case at a Washington hotel.
Service had included Mitch McConnell, head of Republican faction in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending federal society events for years.
And that's not against moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events of law of close and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms associated with the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This astounding break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges with lies, the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US.
"The judges won and dined during a charity event with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support for a fundraising campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they are too easily mixing court matters with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as federal society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a state attorney-general under the Obama administration when the first legal appeals were brought to justice at first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, because she was too involved in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't set up any way to do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Airline Emirates orders 50 two-speed Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It's really a rare news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is total at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
Just as unusual is the customer of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle East airlines will need $450 trillion worth of $2,520 aircraft in the next 20 years.
On the weekend, Boeing announced its biggest order of all time for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 twin Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline has also announced, as Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show, an option to purchase 20 more aircraft that will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
According to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered on Monday, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock market specialist at Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay the planes. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so damaging as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have natural protection," he said.
The order from Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position in the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep Airbus competitor SAS in check, which attacks the supremacy with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of Mexican President loses apparently election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers have supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her application for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the governor's post in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they occupied poll booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had led the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to acknowledge Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came in third place, a severe defeat for the split and luckless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home country and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have quit the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us a brave look into the next year."
ADB pushes Asia to help save the eurozone
Asia's Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the eurozone's bailout in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down Asia's economic growth.
Rajat Nag, Administrative Director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must do "everything in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look "unpleasantly" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that Asia's financial support to European leadership and resources helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has experienced a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe fueled fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support for Asia will be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from falling exports and drying out foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no incentive to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that politically it would be very difficult to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, more than 800 million of whom live on 2 dollars or even less a day.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Executive Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public sector employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/now threatens "the risk of gradation" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon of possible defensive cuts
Defence Minister Leon Panetta heated Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot complete its spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop to many new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a careless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unworkable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were ultimately going to hit the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the war-time contingents in the anti-terrorist struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Personnel recruitments have been cut, which would lead to delays in recruitment and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details on the potential influence of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of confiscation by the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not a result that we should be forced upon."
"The confiscation is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their intervention should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the Senators' new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly outspokenly pronounced the possible cuts, although he has had many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a gloomy picture of what might be ahead - a military with shells, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She really makes you get angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global capacity to deploy and intervene, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could fall victim to deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Marine needed to replace the Humvee.
If we stopped the further development and tests of the F35, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but the proponents say that it is an important next step in arming, so that potential dangers can be eliminated by China and other opponents.
How to Unmask a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy mastering the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury, as reportedly reports have been held back that a retired football coach has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations of campaign financing related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky during his second term at the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating at school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the answers to the exams so that they themselves were well represented in their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that every day we lie between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be lies of necessity.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important to learn for every person, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Scharaden, in which the goal is to call "Have a say!", decloaking a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the ancient myths about lying have been unmasked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They stutter, stammer, blush, and do not always tremble.
From this one must not conclude, however, that these liars are difficult to uncover and unmask.
A trained lie-discoverer can permeate the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, the questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of decloaking, and it is clear that decloaking a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find justice in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at estimating other people, raising their interest and mastering their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men are more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "orienting themselves to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
It's called "baselining," the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the later evaluation of changes.
Watch the posture, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone normally is constantly tripping with your foot, so they don't blame him wrongly when he is tripping with his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of a decloaking.
People who are deceiving may freeze when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relax after the interview", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
The questioners often falsely signal that a job interview is over just to look for that relaxation after the job interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your subject.
The slipper of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive persons can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question as a whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than objective, which often makes the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic device for decloaking lies, but you can learn skills that make it possible to decloak.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become less likely to be the victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be revised after danger from delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned Canadian oil pipeline to the Gulf of Mexico, which upset the trade unions and at the same time reassured environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to re-plan the project so that one can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course of action.
This was done after an announcement by the Foreign Ministry last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of action, which would avoid the area of the sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large underwater supply, had been reviewed.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the Foreign Ministry and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline will connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska's legislators, who are opposed to the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy says that the main inspector of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada is in a conflict of interest to Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she allegedly forced a toddler to vomit because of fear
A New York family claims that the disco-diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had a stroke of rage, which had scared her little daughter so much that she vomited from fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirades frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk to such an extent that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family at the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with his luggage and Genevieve in his arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle enraged the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't drop your daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tip water out of the bottle onto me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her escort and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which a statement was requested.
The lawsuit is about an unspecified compensation, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not charge a fee and that the family would plan to donate the money they were given to help children with cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher wearing an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climatic adversities slowed down the economy
In the first year Mario López Valdez joined the government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in Sinaloa's economic history. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and raised great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, due to the climatic adversities, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also narrowed the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter.This is mainly due to the historical reduction in agricultural development of 31.16 percent, which slowed down further economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a steady rise in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28% and from July to September to 6.19%, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. That is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa that year is due to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly declare the growing unemployment.
"What we are witnessing today is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Amongst other things, liquidity losses in the market due to the cuts in funding by the legislation passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because it is not easy for those who illegally accumulate dollars to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, due on the one hand to entry problems and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and are looking for work, which makes unemployment rise," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which according to INEGI comprises 60.38 percent of the country's employees who work without being paid into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest wages in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (National Agency for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September, much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in FDI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, 2011 saw the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to 630 597 dollars from January to June, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) for its part has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In view of the economic crisis, the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos at the National Congress in July to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in order to reactivate the economy. The state congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effects of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be detected by November.
Reactions
The first year of the government, Mario López Valdé's incapacity for government, was evident to the representatives of the business community.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the ground lost this year and in 2012 we have to double our efforts. The efforts of all and, in particular, the progress of the already well coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important effects is a slowed economy that is not sufficiently moving to generate an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That's why we will complete the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefine appeal
Teodoro Salazar Urirarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana, Sinaloa, stated that it was necessary to induce the state to more dynamic productive activities.
"We have generally observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
Coparmex's chairman stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government's efforts in a better way.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Procuratorate of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a public health offence - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military forces in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez street opposite guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the criminal is still in the prison.
Debts for works
According to Miguel Ángel López Miranda, the social structures for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with a great delay.
The head of the municipal social development agency said that, although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, since the state government has not paid the funds it has to pay, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, 25 percent of which fell to the state. Up to now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction works, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they would have had to pay us part of it already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign, corresponding to the amount that the central government would have had to pay.
"We had already done so in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. Programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance had requested that administrative work be speeded up and that the outstanding share be paid out as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The court approved for 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico
In recent years, the switch from analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, and by virtue of which the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be brought forward, due to a lack of eight votes required to contest the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Decree-Law detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the project for the complaint prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the Decree-Law be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Telecommunications Commission in Mexico), which is why the Decree-Law would contradict the hierarchical principles and the provisions of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. Following the adoption of the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the appeal filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures that the public administration should take with general rules.
"I also do not believe that, if we did, the independence of the regulatory body would be compromised." She also pointed out that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as telecommunications, for constitutional reasons, because it heads state affairs.
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which had not only technical aspects, "because it covered economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
It recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital changeover, through the government, although they had highly specialised facilities.
One could not conclude that the government intervenes in the competences of Congress by issuing the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballot papers individually in Michoacán is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the Governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of ballot papers is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this spirit, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9 the electoral office had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise local regulations with the reforms of the federal states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they did not enter into force during this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Scoreboard within the time limits provided for it with the argument that he did not object.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature and judged the Ombudsman's vote on the constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal" because it did not have the right to "determine or veto it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes, stated that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots in part or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part.The results in the minutes do not agree; the record of counting and calculating the votes is not available on file or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
Furthermore, if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the winner in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, the total counting of the fully completed ballots may be made, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or lower than one per cent, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages suspended from a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
Its ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés poured down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday, the Totenschau and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others, returned to the capital of Coahuila in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force, the next person to attend the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel landed on the funeral hall, which is located on the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m. his remains were examined at the Technological Institute of Saltillo. This body show was initiated by his former classmates from the technical high school and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio belonged to during his preparation for the high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they thought it would be dizzy even on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A Final Farewell
The lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved with all honors under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honour was bestowed on him by the people and government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, school leaders and students of the technological educational institution of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and was outstanding in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew crashed, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority also sat.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over on the forecourt of the barracks by the funeral company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, awaited him.
The abandoned corpses were found on a plot on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military personnel introduced eleven people to the media who had been arrested in the same village in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found killed by gunshots in different parts of the body and a merciless shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the kilometre point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up inaccessible wide.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons about three meters further inside, which they immediately communicated to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another one dressed in a white top.
Just one meter away was another person's body with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three people must have been murdered in another place because no shell shell shells were found.
There are inscriptions on the wall of the country house that one organized gang of criminals writes to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) introduced 11 people, including a minor who were part of a gang of criminals mainly working in Cadereyta, associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were first arrested on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and the arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12th, at 6.00 a.m., military officers found a car with two occupants on their watch in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, at 2 p.m. on November 13th, one of her accomplices was arrested in La Frauda Township, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret funerals in the villages of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government to stand up for the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government to stand up for the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A communication from the presidential palace announced that the Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will introduce a majority of technocrats to a cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said that he would present the President with the results of the talks with political parties on the formation of government.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well laid out," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by the Europoliticians in order to regain the weak confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hurry, which weighs on Monti, was compounded by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were charged with interest rates of 7% for 10 years, corresponding to the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of Confindustria, Italy, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the best of our ability."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign as a result of the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential because so far many of its members have opposed a majority of technocrats that Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resisting its efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks is also putting pressure on Monti's failure.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The session is scheduled to be completed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite towards the end of the last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister has brought the costs of Italian government bonds back to critical limits.
Saving Italy with a sovereign debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout umbrella.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should be made up of technicians only, a reference to their concerns about the process imposed by financial market pressure.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties make the inclusion of persons from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the hump.
Costa Rica has only one of the 22 convening 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game, which takes place today at 15.05 in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-coloured team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international matches.
This number he reached last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there is the experience with the Spanish Furie in complex competitions at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the framework of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking list.
We'll see how the Spanish team draws their last tab: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who scored a match with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (lose 0-1 in London) with 126 matches abroad.
Today Casillas will play against the three-colour team and Spain will have a new record of 127 foreign matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle striker of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number one hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left-hand side striker Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five games came to over 30: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the fewest games.
In the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) there are fewer than 30 games.
From the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't even approaching the 20's.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar records only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson haven't had their debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an excerpt from the interview, whose complete copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
This is just the second time we're playing in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
For us it's exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are totally devoted. They experience the days before the concert intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like surfing and we love the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world for this.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we set no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so that the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven't played for a long time in the repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think that none of us imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years, which seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then, a band emerges from a city, but it is quite unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still looking forward to being friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being happy to be alive and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don't go on tour too often, because it's too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you think people have come for the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We never cared about that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who set up the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band best. That's why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's lyrics when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
Of so many+
The first ones I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bassists I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I think we all don't feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think that's great, because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now it's more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that might seem a bit careless, but there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed play them. They are very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family member or a friend - that will definitely affect your artistic work and your music and these two songs.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times operated and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian Hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he felt that Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not want this because he thought he was innocent.
He has been operated on four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the presidential office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calderón's support for the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still exist as tax havens. This declaration was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and industrialised countries. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concreteisation of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
At the business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The purr-bearded installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for 25 years for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month to the shop counters all over the world, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can be played three-dimensionally without a special pair of glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain at the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game by Nintendo to be developed for this console from the very beginning" because until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were already existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "affordable" video game that allows a fast, smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less shagged users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different game levels, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo winks to the fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The purr-bearded installer must overcome dangerously picked platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to be responsible in the United States for the US $70 million money-laundering conspiracy.
This is how the US's request to extradite Portillo ends so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judicial authority and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered with court decisions during his government and had granted all the extradition requests he had been informed of.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The action taken by Colom is a government act which takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, Portillo must be extradited if its legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case anew.
Trinijove helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter of a century, 6000 young people threatened with social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was established in 1986 in Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by many officials from institutions and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during election campaigns demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and now left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and the Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Jaume Lanaspa, Director General of the Social Fund of the Sparkasse La Caixa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house where huge parties were held was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resisting.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on the street Balmes have come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily the building, which they illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals, which had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation took place by judicial order without police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was changed to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, the access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply with them. In addition, they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the beginning of the occupation.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the disco.
In addition, the owner of the leisure area had been reported by the neighbors because of restlessness, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and in particular from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbours, became more and more and more longer in the last weeks.
The discotheque said that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building that he had not to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it had received more complaints from its neighbours in recent weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called for the building to be cleared immediately and the problems of civil coexistence and the downfall of the district to be tackled.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the squatters had penetrated into all floors of the building and almost all apartments in the last months. In some, theft had even occurred.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday another building in the district of Nou Barris was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., the police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had been watching four people enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the invitation to tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The urban call for proposals for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona anew.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its disdain for the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (seas).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear was no longer used as a model.
This is how far it was when the city issued a huge invitation to tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's planning on putting gates in the country.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for proposals is not only from an organizational point of view, but also from a reflection on the city in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring topic, on which two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can rely.
And precisely this fact provides the basis for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary to speak after the attack on the coast about the "front on the mountains" as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which about the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It should be based on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it must not be imagined "as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban development experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers resulting from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it nowadays" after the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation on what can be built.
"Limiting something always means setting the next step", i.e. exceeding it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the present [referring to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, believes that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronate de Collserola, which should not be "feeling deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the lead letter, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams that have been created ("just the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, since the tender conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "16 competitions were advertised in cross-section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain-sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
This, at least in his case, has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between the city and green areas.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the agent of Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial being waged against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the agent of Casino Red has given him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is leading the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to operate the betting house in secret.
Following the lawsuit, the prosecution opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2nd for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he stayed in the Central Security Section for only a few hours, as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On 25 October, the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, sent him a warrant for detention, which found that after nearly two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence to convince Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open it in return.
This Monday, the agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to give the mayor's brother the penalty, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, assigned to the court, asked García Gómez whether he had corrected the damage and whether the owner of the betting house had given his forgiveness. However, the lawyer withheld the name.
In accordance with Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted and no appeals can be filed against the trial, and no compensation is required.
After hearing the plenipotentiary of the Wetthaus at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case was filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, gives details of the aircraft accident, in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transport - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident, in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed, pointed out that the helicopter, with its whole intact structure, had hit the ground directly without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that the pilot had confirmed before taking off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had run down.
"In the search no aircraft parts were found in other places, the impact concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an angle of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it may take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Assistance Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidencial at cruising speed and that the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points which should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions during take-off. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds were raised.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the crew had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter match. Possibly there was no loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter had bounced from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter, with its intact structure, had hit the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the scene of the accident do not indicate fire or explosion.
The last results of the investigation indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is steep and has an angle of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter was probably broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area beyond the closed area at the scene of the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had hit the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She is head of a research project on finding the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence", with which the genetic markers are to be found in connection with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the postgraduate programme at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the Cuauhtémoc sports field (in the west of the state of México) and continued on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
Once the target of 500 to 600 investigators has been achieved, the study will be continued on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global Day of Diabetes, he said that three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of six and 14 should complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He also stated that on the above-mentioned Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (testing the identification of genes related to childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out in the light of the concern of health workers about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of the obese girls increased by 47 percent. Overweight also increased dramatically," said IMSS specialist.
He claimed that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He said that an (e) Mexican (in) average is 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) taken from us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants of the study would be a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (Akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated in writing to the parents by the doctors. Doctors will explain to the parents all measurement results and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics that will be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, develops polymer modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention were to be paid to the signs from the road surface, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes if the rainy season broke out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt surface were to be done appropriately, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Threat holes from a technical point of view", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, one of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other a low - the so-called maltene. Together they give the road surface its characteristic viscous behavior.
The toughness of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and almost solid at 50°C, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The researcher at the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible road surfaces, consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers there is a wear layer of asphalt consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single piece of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on to it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer", he said, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called supporting layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they have to create friction.
This road surface receives and distributes most of the forces, the supporting layer also requires an appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be considered, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes damp, water penetrates into the layer and comes out difficult again. This causes a softening of all layers of the road surface and as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a pothole is formed," he said, "the top layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. However, the damage does not occur immediately, but rather it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in proportion to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without applying high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that had an impact on Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th miss title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca left empty when the crown was awarded to Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winning podium, presenting a silver crown and the band that she identifies as a new Miss Colombia.
This night's result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, has already reached 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown. Among the proclaimed Misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many people ask themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at each demonstration that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also been preserved by the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury's decision to appoint her First Miss is that she did not convince her of the answer to the question "Which book influenced you most and why?" that Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos had asked her.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I really believe in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing myself, in the end I think that the book that shaped my childhood the most is 'The Little Prince', a rather profound book.
At the moment I am reading 'debt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called 'passions'.
An answer that met with little reluctance, firstly because of the concept of 'civilizing' and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony, Melina explained that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had all the coincidences and had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, Audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which the queen stressed, which could not shine on stage."
And that's what you noticed at her first performance in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she appeared safely in both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned a Miss "shows that the candidate who wins most prizes during the competition will not become queen after all".
In addition, Valle got out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jurie about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriers and fibrosis, which were noted to her in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which was honestly hard to notice for me, squeezed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them do it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction arose after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was to come true at night. It was tugged that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina will start her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming performance for Cartagena.
Thus was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopeist from Cali entered the story as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, last year, a Lophoscope of the Investigation Unit of the Procuratorate (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) came in: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years, had been on call this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often spent five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and, after completing the necessary courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was supposed to identify two bodies and that there was a suspicion that one of the men who led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be one. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger print-sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the most examiner, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, which was not the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, had no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen correctly: It was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this Puerto Tejada-born man was in charge of telling the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for traces
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identification papers or they do not have one.
We'll take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house in case of a theft, because the thief had supported himself with his hand exactly at this point when he pulled out a safe stuffed with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspected of being a suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A daktyloscopeist of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents are taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or ribbon is used to carry them.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil status office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID papers," the expert from the CTI explained.
He said not everything was the way it was shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is shining, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "indignant" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Most of them followed the eviction order and changed their location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday when they again tried to enter Manhattan Square with a judicial order after they had been cleared of the square at dawn and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, which they wanted to gain access to with a court order allowing the "indignant" to camp again at this site. Meanwhile, another part of the movement followed the eviction order and occupied a park further north of the city, where nine arrests were held.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray pointed out that the "indignant"'s response to the evacuation of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forcible evacuation of the place and authorising the demonstrators to camp.
In addition, the "Empörten" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, even though Bray could not give exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists handcuffed among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had arrived at this point, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will analyse the legality of the eviction taking place at dawn.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the square carried photocopies of this court order and distributed them. They even gave them to some policemen who guarded the square, which resulted in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had reported that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear in front of the press that due to this court order, the new opening of the square to the public traffic and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the clearing of Zuccotti Square at dawn, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "disobeyed the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people" because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents were "anxious about their quality of life".
"Eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests rather than protecting the interests of North American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press."
The leaders of Occupy Wall Street informed them that they were thinking about organizing "big actions" for Thursday, along with community organisations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking since September 17th.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson will perform together with the "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today broadcast images of the television program in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-made pornography, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a virgin Mary with a doll in her lap, which Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently working as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" programme, appears as Jesuskind.
CTV's Christmas programme not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far away from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had called North American Kim Kardashian "whore".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free fall spiral from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, which was still recovering after the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan had experienced in World War II.
The government's initial estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the gross domestic product figures from July to September were finally used to complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the rate extrapolated to the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline in investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has woken up, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - into one of the "excursion currencies" of investors fleeing from the eurozone debt crisis and the dim forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that weighs like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the yen listing.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the flooding in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very cheering.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States showed clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which precedes the turning points of the world economy, showed that the biggest economic potentials would be slowed down.
For he dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is 100 after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of the peripheral countries and growing uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the maze that leads out of the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is a response to the pressure from Brussels rather than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one hundred days he had been appointed may be too short to implement them, the leader of the conservative Nueva Democratica party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and not withdraw his call for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of civil servants' disciplinary law and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not cast doubt on his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs, and he made it clear that he would not approve a commitment to meet the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that there was no need to shake its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The greek tangle still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant global position in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the world's second donor to this instrument of international cooperation, whose "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for the whole of humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the fifth World Summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of people living with incomes of less than one dollar a day, that is, below the "poverty line".
Spain "continues to work" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which will last until Thursday, will guarantee "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for launching "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said that it was intended that 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would cross the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of micro-credit goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia regards as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen went to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe a continuous development", the Queen explained, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday the assessment as "family head" in Valladolid and as "proponent of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the industrialised countries now "more than ever" had to work according to solidarity criteria and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always standing on closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its gates, engulfed by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Christian Democrats Congress (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig) was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy on Greeks today and possibly Italy to be too lax tomorrow.
The European Commission's proposal for the presidency, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes, which was first valid due to the intervention decrees of Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, left no doubt on the part of the three ministers of finance who were drawn to Europe.
The main idea of the chancellor, as well as the requests, has the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty to the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area, which strengthens the control of the European Union; however, this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote" in order to give a face to Europe".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which was clearly sponsored by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal of weighting each country on the ECB's board of directors according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously result in a strengthening of Germany's position.
The chancellor, who is concerned with calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the points of reference for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or in difficulty European countries, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European request dedicates a paragraph to the significance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud in case of illness represent?
After family allowances, UMP and the government are now attacking the sick reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allowance fund and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to test the economy in a harsh way, but on the other hand is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidency campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' sick reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government intends to introduce a fourth day of maternity leave prior to the inclusion of sick leave for employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the wage of four days without the approval of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to provoke anger, but would help to contribute EUR 280 million.
And this would be accompanied by another measure of a more symbolic nature: giving state officials an unremunerated day of maternity leave in the event of illness (so far, unlike the three days of maternity leave in the private sector, there is no waiting period for them).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuses associated with work absence.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will also be remunerated if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13, from the RTL transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the area of sick leave seems a little disproportionate.
This has indeed been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives since 2002, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer ill more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first stay with the national figures.
According to the CNAM National Health Insurance Fund, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, daily payments in 2008 represented 5% of health expenditure, at 11.3 billion euros.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave, accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were only granted 14.5 sick days on average.
One mean that covers up certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40 000 surveyed, French workers stated that they had not taken a single day of the sick.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the cases in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% over.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers therefore no longer tend to become incapacitated.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (healthy or otherwise justified) oscillated, ranging from 10% to 11% in France to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in cases of illness is a negligible proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is only a weak measure.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic checks on sick people that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM (public college for the education and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 short-term sick reports implemented, which is 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
For systematically controlled cases of illness of more than 45 days duration, under 1.2 million 11% were counted in "unfit or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed an illness report.
A figure which represents only a weak measure against, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a substantive report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defrauding of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced this to Parliament, accompanied by the fact that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to carry out this task.
"To continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the euro area was at stake, as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "by 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his approval to the measures already approved in order to try to escape the debt crisis, but had sent it forward that his party would not be prepared to make an additional austerity effort.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a congress of his party New Democracy.
He had agreed to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties to support the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalised, according to an expert body
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving means, including beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually get involved in talking to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice takes place, for patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has ranked 10th in this regard, the study notes that "medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of these eventually die in the hospital.
Looking at the country as a whole, the rate is highest at 86% of hospital deaths in Quebec.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions which are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already decided not to amend the law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to the experts, all those countries whose approach has legalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide or decriminalized them have equally inspected, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by uncompetent or non-consent persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such transgressions are encountered, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already grown up in favor of euthanasia, since they believe that at the end of their lives, they allow people to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalised does not mean that the message is that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or cessation of medicines in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest, in their list of recommendations, that the criminal law should indicate that the withdrawal of the means for which a legally valid refusal had occurred should not be considered criminal.
The Panel also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect the cessation of means at the end of life, without fear of prosecution.
The Panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving means, including beyond cancer.
Finally, the Panel calls for at least consideration to be given to pain relief or life-long measures, which are already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, as they did not serve to reduce physical pain and relate to the same procedures as euthanasia.
Other experts' reservations
Some experts in the field of health have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the position of the report-signatory experts as "extreme", among other things, since they set no limits on the practice of euthanasia in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and over 18 years old asks another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's personal responsibility above all other values involved in the social work of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "pro-euthanasia Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the report on the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, however, is opposed to it thanks to Russia's support and rejects a "complot" against the country, increased yesterday.
Two days before Syria's Arab League decision, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbouring countries, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the incumbent Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "set down his power in Syria" in which around forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar's interest in his country was at heart, he would resign, but he would also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation efforts to the Syrian regime, which had been directed since the beginning of the year, had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and are unable to satisfy them must go," he said in allusion to Syria, the neighbouring country, on which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"In view of the repression in Syria, the international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an increasingly sharp tone," says Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region in southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in "mouse changes and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Mulallim nevertheless felt that the country was "taxing towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted emphatically to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which, in his opinion, is a "dangerous step".
"Syria will not give in," he added under the assertion that "the plots forged against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of the deployment of UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression that encapsulates him in his "paranoia".
An extraordinary new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the outbreak of the crisis decided on 2 November, in particular the controversial and probable withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday considered the Arab League's decision to be "uncorrect" in order to avoid the support for possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on markets to be patient and Italy to make sacrifices
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that calls for "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting between trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in parliament, which was made up of relatively strict external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, for his part had been waiting for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In "democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government program, he stressed, saying that it would be "certain that markets will show themselves to be stupid and understanding".
His appointment by the president was welcomed by the markets at the beginning, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The current Prime Minister was to set up a staff consisting of predominantly technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Since the beginning of his role, M. Monti has committed himself to working in all urgency in the sense of the goal of making Italy the "renewed protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change, even taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budget equalisation in 2013, despite the austerity plans taken up in recent months, has in particular requested new tough measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italian chief of staff, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need to boost the economy" because a country that has no growth to show, cannot respect the deficit ratios".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as the EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "change of epoch" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the"challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here would be the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to pay 200 billion euros of state bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon detonator capsule, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA and other documents originating from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA reported its "serious concern" on the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently had worked for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the centre to start a company in Kiev, which produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he had then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear explosives system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only extremely knowledgeable in this technology, but also, as a member of the agency's state announced, had worked his entire professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either declined slightly or have only slightly increased over the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" had risen to 6,628 in a very weak measure, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First emphasized.The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights law," added Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, assessing that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards "hate crimes".
In American federal law, the "hate crime" is an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or descent and now also involving crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter converts the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microblogging website introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" make it easier to read live to understand the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are being tracked and who follow your messages.
This makes it possible to find out whether they allow their messages to be tracked, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users", said Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with somewhat esotherically-looking wording (RT for referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Activity" will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The government in power in Austria of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, much above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not fallen at a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros of interest every year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister.
Austria also issued a request from the Brussels summit of the euro area Member States of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to the public balance of accounts in the constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken for this purpose by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model" since Germany had been the first European country to include such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP), while from 2017 onwards the federal structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% threshold of GDP, while regional and local governments should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the yen continues to rise, Japanese power would once again intervene in the currency markets.
"If we establish excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again close to the historical levels that had forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is heading for a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, doped by purchases of investors who see the yen as a "excursion value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has slipped below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese motto harms the exports of the archipelago, since it costs the "Made in Japan" products more expensive and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, since they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region in the north-east," says M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the Yen can kill the weak upswing already in the bud.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year, has regained momentum thanks to the booming export growth and consumption of "sealed" households as a result of the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the inflation of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to defuse the yen.
Mr Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has, however, informed that the BoJ had already launched "suitable measures", thus making it clear that no additional monetary easing could be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) in order to redeem the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover that it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet up fast, stock exchanges make retreat
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the new leaders in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting into negative areas even more this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and dropped to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions in government bond yields in the difficult eurozone, global stock markets are continuing to release some of their recent profits.
"Investors are nervous and too well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a bail of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trade is moving on a limited corridor of variation as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the euro area damages the single currency, which continues its bail on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 o'clock the European value was worth 1,3570 Dollers, so it declined by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, approved a motion that specifically provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to withdraw from the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates on loans from Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the Italian bond yield reached 6.85% for 10 years, and the Spanish bond yield reached 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed investors' fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened with paralysis by the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro-zone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical high.
Expected growth figures of the euro area
Statistically speaking, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries the economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first extrapolation of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 o'clock, with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts Should Win Over Dogms
If an issue exists that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing for a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, the shortage of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitutional source, nor in Switzerland, which only intends to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
The UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided to join its park in Fukushima by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which was closed after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is geared to renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as a model, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, especially on Russia, as a result of the increased use of imported gas, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, the European leader in the table for wind energy, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, and, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy, which means that its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% higher electricity bills than our French households.
Since the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and a stability of industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the large majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France took the decision to phase out nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports per year would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of his producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation one has to admit that there is as little as a devil's work a miracle remedy for the generation of electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as the Flamanville construction site.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the concept of security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, and that in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so it has been without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction and inexcusable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach as well as a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable for electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is imperative and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres to dominate a debate that also determines our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment against foreign students had shaped the weekly shows from the official side, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "does not need talent, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac was struck, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, should not be a problem for a country" from the left, by Michel Rocard, who stated in 1990 that France "could not absorb all the poverty of the world".
The only difference is in the degree of largeness
The fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from both right and left.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity one is willing to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande's programme confines himself to banalities that point to partnership development allowing us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent work that summarizes the latest insights on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of the immigration flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would depress growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the domestic workforce, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than local wage earners, as they focus on occupations in sectors that are jobless in terms of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where domestic wage workers are less incentivised, the more skilled of immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, so this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the immigration flood would result in a related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas introduced by immigrants is beneficial to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net contribution to social security systems, with an average of about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, contribute a net contribution (receipts minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to begin his mandate to achieve the missing intersections "with the teeth".
However, these teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the entire 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote in the most direct way possible to see democracy prevail over their enemies once and for all.
Since Napoleon "the little one" it is known that it was a characteristic of the attitude.
The universal suffrage, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this purpose and can become as well a "instrument of oppression" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, education, an economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and above all a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek truth-false referendum would have had a double revealing character in this regard: the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organized in accordance with the needs and in the wrong order.
A free ticket for the European sole ruler or a leap blindfolded into the void of nationalistic retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full justice, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time on a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, we no longer know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - and it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each and every one of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to give the people's sovereignty back the leadership of the European project.
Because it is all about whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and initiate a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions on a European level which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without certainly leading us to ruin.
After a long period of fighting against this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today urges European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as the citizens have in mind - this would be a new folly and a further dead end.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must form a Europe that is better integrated at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards become a common asset
The world fair for smart cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris with an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that enables payments on public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold this year, 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide!
Their market share was expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after a long time of lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
The consumer markets, however, are making a fuss.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out bank cards to their customers in the future, equipped with contactless chips," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A decreasing percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to carry out these transactions.
"They're late."
"But at least next year they should experience a real upswing."
"In 2012, we expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
Yesterday the Crédit Agricole announced the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare for the launch of an offer that would enable its customers to make contactless payments by mobile phone.
Terrorist front of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty" about this.
"The way in which both organizations proceed, as well as the relations of the secret services, indicate clear cooperation," he said without going into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January had revealed interfaces.
Anatoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped by Aqmi supporters at a restaurant in Niamey, were killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips in the debris at the site that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had for a long time stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we must wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's conceivable, however."
"It has been known for years that the cult receives financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming increasingly active," said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become ever more evident in their course, as have the speeches and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives, which bear the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community to begin with Washington has been putting pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed for a long time regarded the group as a community of Illuminati, to which no particular attention needs to be paid.
Faster success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict adherence to Sharia, while the activists associated with it fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists first target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their intensified attacks against the commissioners.
However, the reaction from Abuja is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, with 800 dead.
The prisoner Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was assigned the guilt of a suicide bombing that took place in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations' local headquarters became a priority international target.
Since then, the formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has disturbed all security experts.
While the Aqmi occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Harem and showed his willingness to share all the information."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like this, the voters could almost get that impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-companies have repeatedly announced their thundering statements and their statements on foreign policy, a traditional republican focus.
Slogans about China, Iran and Israel's aid - often not backed up in any way - fall.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mit Romney, the highest in the course, threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that is most irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Stupidly ran, if this is to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost cut off his air with regard to his emotional gesture.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama's current attitude).
But Huntsman is not answered, as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military blows against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he had toned.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest placed candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of the file.
He recently called for the Chinese military threat to be counter-ed, as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to pay attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, in turn expresses his willingness to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama's 2009 ban on resorting to torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry, and Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political heavyweight.
The current presidential opponents said that Reagan had also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was also an amateur and had to pour water into his wine on the subject of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not so casual.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions leading to the Erlahmen.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resurrect its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is said to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendor and glory.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte symbolically turned together the control of the valve that transports the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first 1.224 km pipeline connecting the St Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the total French consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you can already mention the eventuality of building a third line on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable a direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: for them, it is becoming more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most heavily engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" linked to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, at the expense of defusing European energy, as the project has broken the gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years' time, Russia has managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that have strong gas consumptions and whose gas reserves are running out.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are also important from the political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete sheathing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea at a depth of about 200 metres.
During its construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be evaded.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, stronger measures to protect fauna and flora had to be taken.
The line is a long snake made of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from it, as the Swedes had little desire to see a Russian state society settle in a permanent way at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of a disaster, we close the gas outlet in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered to be unlikely by the constructors, since the seams were estimated to be resistant to one leak per 100,000 years.
State surveillance of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes by a seagoing vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on its arrival about possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been designed to function for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit.
Five societies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (each 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a group of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real-transported gas volume is," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are aware that they will recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin.
The 4.5-meter-high valves form the gas outlet gates.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic metres of Russian gas per passing hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelight hours spent writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognisable, with its black rectangular cover, its rubber band, the egg-shell-colored sides, as if aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook on the market at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's specialist consultant at the time, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by a traditional production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton coat that is used, for example, for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was very popular among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, who is now responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with a sales volume of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We followed the zeitgeist and his new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: recently the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural zeitgeist and was able to diversify his products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the full range of articles.
A success that envies the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No, according to Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, which organises the "Work Week for the Disabled".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but triple."
"Nevertheless, there is an enormous amount of work to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school leaving certificate and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher level of education.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of disabled people compared to 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work and which constitute the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the physical brakes.
Remain the unspoken, the attitudes that develop, although certain, but slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Association for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers surveyed "have a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled" which "is overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually inferior".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, as set out in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, which date back to 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, General Director of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The proof: the number of "paying" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, Pierre Blanc explained."
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the workplaces between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a luck"
Even before the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 am) were up to the brow, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasures, which brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far-fetched to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the viewer's podium at the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have been happy to make peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his opponent against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had won nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," says the native of Lille.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and national team"It's a unity that justifies everything."
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to get started."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France, in order to finally "gloss".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7 and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably helps to strengthen the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just crossed our way."
"To be able to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, made a sound of good-natured pride.
"The pride of a gala match."
"Pride" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbours" - that France" has again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician sees himself sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... and that in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're about to plan one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the backlash against Bosnia (22:00 o'clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first match, both teams had lacked objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
Indeed, for Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and to dump an opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was not able to stamp on the matter the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, as we have not achieved an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly shining stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will get through in front of an audience, which is likely to be equally hot at the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic, but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be part of the 2012 European Championship", however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
The draw in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, as we have not achieved an away goal," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, so as not to give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it is put into practice this time.
