Food to Blame European Inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro-zone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded after the 2.6 per cent in October, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are based on only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the Leitzsin. At its discretion, the cut in interest rates would favour rising commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment to create an inflation spiral.
The ECB strives to keep inflation below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a mess: inflation must be "agreed" in order to avoid the need for action later.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the euro area is due to the rise in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also experienced a significant inflation in 2007.
The world price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but is expected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but estimate the annual average rate at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup orts government crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the support for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
In the case of party-faithful voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) are in favour of the MSZP for a fifth (20 percent).
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: they reach two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "pronouncedly bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "fairly bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate further; only a tenth expect improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historical high - considered the Prime Minister's work "rather bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the percentage of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be managed even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% had still voted in favour of the government and the head of government, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would "certainly" participate, and another 20% would "probably" vote.
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty", and another 15% would consider their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
Transferred to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the proportion of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would amount to 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Also most expensive, Tesco increases by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörse trading area have also maintained this year's average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF were registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets were "galoped" last December, inflation did not fall sharply as a percentage compared to the already high, earlier level of inflation.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they paid for in the past year is not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained close to the previous year's level, whereas prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy increased sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but for Auchan there were 1kg of bread-wakes for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop in the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including the deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora was the most favorable.
Our calculations show that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" basket compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive one of today's year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the past year and the most expensive one of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1,206,00 Forint, but the VAT increase was noticeable in prices at last Christmas.
This is precisely the case with trade: it seems that department stores could not quite decide what price range they should apply to each article, since the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unpredictable.
(If the trader does not plan the speed of circulation of a product badly, it may fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" basket was so radical in the past year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost more by 1,630.00 Forint than in the previous year, and even the cheapest one there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared with the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, and the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some staple foods, the Statistical Office recorded more than 30% inflation over the period of 12 months.
In addition to flour and eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has hardly increased by more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals.
In the golden trading triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable food go in pallets across the counters.
Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the cash desk in all three department stores when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer frequency, so many multinationals complain to opinion polls that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
Sanitary conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overcrowding of staff - all factors that are not conducive to the containment of infections, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
The traumatology department of János Hospital recently diagnosed MRSA infection.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
Until 10 December of this year, multi-resistant pathogen-induced infections from hospitals were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System in 1094, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were safely registered in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in its nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the drugs are dosed too high or used improperly, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the everyday illness.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is only no where it is not wanted.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nurses wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
While the patients are being examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable to the control of the formation or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients who have been admitted and isolate MRSA-infected immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not so common in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the State sickness fund for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among the outpatients or patients in basic care, microbiological sampling is even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
The disinfectants are saved
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to another by the nursing staff.
This is precisely why washing your hands or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient in the home hospitals.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds are lined up in a row, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to note, unfortunately, in the financially less well-placed hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes the health insurance companies enormous costs, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its containment was recorded in the government programme.
After initial signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death handlebar pullover was not drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official report on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he took the wheel.
The former police chief, using his own car in the XXII district, entered Kossuth Lajos Straße and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked location.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, subordinate.)
The pedestrian died after he was admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has opened its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the outset.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three EUR 400 million credit agreements in Budapest on Friday. The money will go to education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of EUR 100 million was signed earlier and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million lent.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be spent on the budget financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary and the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be channelled into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of the underground financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-linked, the loan is provided by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, without any commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe looks attentively at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the cheapest market in the EU, but is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is without a doubt the most sought after place for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, however, real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will soon or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the very favorable area of Ruse, with more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office areas offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfer's paradises, attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons in the other two seasons.
Prospective investors are therefore already buying in on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive for a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized real estate by 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connections and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term increase in value.
However, real estate in the capital is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but there has been an annual price increase of 21 percent over the past five years.
The price of real estate prices far exceeds the rise in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the post-2012 emission-reducing measures, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a heated debate between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question at the conference is whether the industrialised countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on support for developing countries.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, probably by the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's desire to maintain its leadership in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 levels), regardless of whether or not the "Agreement after 2012" was achieved successfully. The Union would even be willing to support a 30% reduction if other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to fulfil their commitments in a strong and responsible manner.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that had acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed itself to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will definitely meet, as can be seen in the Ministry of Environment's press release.
The deployment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the UN's Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientific climate change committee in its latest report.
This would delay emission reduction and increase the Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
British Army units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been launching videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The images shot with helmet mounted miniature cameras are controlled at the air force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Luftwaffe have already contributed 139 such images, their "channel" was viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraq-based international peacekeepers (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Luftwaffe has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of foreign missions.
According to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie of the BBC, such published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to traditional television advertising, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, also make it online - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, at most, the losses are talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "gating".
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less life-scattered simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsch in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means zimperlich: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a work conference at which her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsch.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas mood with raffles or kicks into the civil servants' hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so celebrates the power.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the defence department, but not the employees of the ministry are expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department will provide around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFTC) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the strands.
The Ministry of Economy's 4.32 million forint Christmas celebration will be held in the house of the future, with around 350 of the 600 employees expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFU) held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The room rental amounted to 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, one department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party, which is organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the "Vígszínház" was rented for the celebration.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the responsible ones.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At [origo]'s request, it was stated that there was no ball dress or suit requirement at the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are preparing for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for its employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference for the end of the year.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration ends with 350,000 forints.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply start in the auditorium of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own festival hall, where 436 employees are expected.
The expenditures were measured at 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-off.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, PM employees have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites to a New Year reception on January 20, and the Christmas celebration of the Ministry is cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget") and, according to the department, the expenses are estimated at 1,000 forints per guest.
As reported by the Press Department, it will be a very simple standing reception to which foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary only are invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a brief speech by the minister and end with a restrained smoky.
As the respective press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the costs of the Christmas party, the Ministry of the Environment's press department could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces are mobilized for giant strik
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite duration of the strike beginning on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work stoppage begins.
It is expected that there will be significant traffic obstacles due to strikes, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will also be on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly will be held, and from Monday on, all organizations that have joined the strike will put down the work for an indefinite period of time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss how to proceed.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will not be possible to vote on the Health Insurance Act until later in the evening, or even at midnight.
The strikes that start on Monday will have to be accompanied by considerable traffic obstacles: Railway workers are laying down their work for an indefinite period of time; in the morning, the majority of public transport and more than half of Volán's companies will be shut down.
At the same time, there will be many roadblocks in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is continuously updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, while others planned a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZSZ on sufficient services, although more and more people are travelling by train, especially around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV strikes between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. from the start of operations until 1 p.m. at Budapest Airport, the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union bwz. the Democratic teachers' union called for 2 or 2-8 hours strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike at different times throughout the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three states that the eligible occupational groups will be allowed access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the sidelines and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "strengthening of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsies in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this was the Hungarian Guard's strategy, which probably aims at provoking such an argument, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary contrast".
It is thought that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "have seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been constantly on the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called themselves "national self-defense association" have been founded.
"It is common for these groups to define themselves as civil organizations, while openly boasting that they are preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (disaster protection, national defence, orderly protection), relying on the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state itself," it was said.
And further: all this is done according to the method that tries to disguise various political aspirations as bourgeois initiatives, based on the political and party-riddenness of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association does not merely serve to circumvent legal barriers that could arise in the course of registration with the court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirming its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it was said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central East Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as an opportunity to establish the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organisation was "national protection".
In their opinion, there has been a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state remained indifferent and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have triggered a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, says the Risk Alert Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the news office's request: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and should risk-changing trends be identified, public opinion will be informed as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Festive days are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redistributing the working days around the holidays has become established, but the coming year will bring us less such days.
In the EU and in America, too, something else is understood as "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and work-free days.
Unemployed days are mostly church holidays, or are associated with important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year's Day: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and October 23rd, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the foundation of the state, on 1 May the work is celebrated, on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day postponement" has proven itself in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be worked out, the Minister of Labour has for many years laid down a separate regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants.
Only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays, are excluded.
This year, the work order is only a little confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country will remain formal, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve will take time off, or the holiday that has been suspended for this purpose.
Next year, there will be more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redistributions in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second re-disposal is related to the holiday on October 23rd: On Saturday, October 18th, the Friday, October 24th will have to be completed in advance.
The end of the year, however, will stand completely in the sign of the holidays, after everything will lie down and stop from 24 December, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive little things to annoy workmates
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday life in the workplace.
The question is only whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to consciously avoid it for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it up to it by calling the marketing department and confessing remorsefully that you forgot to send the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, consider what you can do to give your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more nervous than grabbing a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, one should borrow nothing from the colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find something has gone.
So, don't put any envelopes or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there if you really need it.
Gossip about colleagues' private life?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what to who?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or conjectures) about the private life of the colleagues to the nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and betrays his inner secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to keep quiet like a grave, rather than direct the person who is not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report yourself sick on the basis of painful headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unpostponable executions, projects with fixed appointments must now be done by your colleagues instead of by yourself.
So don't play bad with the colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't make it to the office the next day, or that something could come up, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, giggles, phone calls
You're in deep focus in your work, but you're suddenly disturbed by the loud giggles of your colleagues?
Unintentionally listening to a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
One should not annoy the colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over their heads), taunting, constant swearing or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deeply deepened in a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed on time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or message, one should not look for the guilt of one's own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit one's mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for the missed one, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training Pants and Slings: Comfortable for home, but has nothing to lose in the office!
Even then, one should not dress so casually if the workplace actually allowed it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of every morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The local music scene hasn't spoiled us with qualitative electropop for a long time.
But now you can even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, as many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock is again "in" with its guitar quit, the local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, playing in the band Yonderboi himself, before - perhaps because a tavern doesn't tolerate two whistles - he started his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, was only achieved when one had approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which was initially performed in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and named Zagar, together with Yonderboi, the almost only trendsetter, also in the West marketable.
Undoubtedly Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time Balázs Zságer was on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but besides the ethereal character of the music, the purer guitar - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - the influences of Rock'n'Roll are noticeable.
With these songs, singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at Millenáris.
A song from the album even made it to the radio hit - the recently released mr2 Petőfi, which broadcasts pop music from early to late, has gradually put the earworm on the listener with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's fine (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to listen also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
For example: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
For example: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more of our concerts are coming.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but this in turn only exists in the incomprehensible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed that if you want to do everything right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built up his career more in the West.
For example: We don't really go his way, apart from the fact that you always try to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves as team players who rely on the other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" is first and foremost.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
For example: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be used as a drawhorse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why she in particular, what was the guiding principle?
For example: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting the choir together from gifted soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later baptized "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls help shape it?
For example: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sung the melody that night, and later they learned the girls.
It all came right at once and frighteningly spontaneously.
I remember, I was quite electrified back then, but the "Divas" was already in need.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: On the record as well as at the concert one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They also stood on the stage in the back.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The point of the number is also that one should forget one's ego a little bit, forget who came from and where to go, we simply allow one to lift up these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
For example: There was actually no musical work at all, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, on "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or on "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but gradually everything joined together, like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes constantly with the concerts and also now that I have "lose" the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraud broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Groundless fraudsters
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel describes the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came for him for almost five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues immediately, and was certainly not incapable of doing it.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
"He is mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
However, as Kerviel's statements published by the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, show, he was a person who had made a profit of 1.6 billion euros in his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had earlier payment problems, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that, and he was right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits and continues that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so that they wouldn't get him on the loop.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid he'd be blown up?
Hardly.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a realtor and in 2005 he became an independent realtor with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Even during my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With Allianz shares, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros in the London bombings on price losses of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you go
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses were supposed to know everything, or they knew it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they come to him?
He was suspicious of himself on a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A real estate agent who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want him to be looked into the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros in the coming years (about 365 billion kroons).
This is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroons come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion kronor from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will go into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money will increase in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have a budget of 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds to innovative enterprises.
The aim is to attract companies to finance the introduction of new technologies, business research and the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries among the new candidate countries in the current EU fund money acquisition.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year prison term for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the AP news agency, it is currently unclear whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) is back behind bars again.
According to the chairman of the appeal court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officers whether you let Alemán serve his sentence at home or whether you have to go to prison.
A court found four years ago that Alemán had regularly postponed government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts really belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund set up by Alemán to fund his campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed, and which has been adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted it, and therefore the ČSSD could not allow itself to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-respected, yet very important law in peace.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful subject for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is compulsory by law, not only pensions, but also social expenditure that the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third limitation is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and reasonably under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to tap further sources of investment other than income from taxes, taxes, and bank loans, often spent unconsidered debt securities that over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off this debt by massively selling shares of the energy and other supply networks they had received from the state in the course of privatisation.
Now this source has already dried up.
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
our economy has been going through a period of growth for several years, like the rest of the world, which the ČSSD is boasting without ceasing.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Although it has succeeded in removing some of the nonsense populist expenditures that were adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no postponement of the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain for him to manage.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that it will turn ruling politicians into officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditures.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of kroner 70 billion planned for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent in the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we do not want it to really happen that ruling politicians become mere administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees, want to rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow for the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
For example, more than $100 billion will be spent on the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money from each other.
For example, the American Fed is sending 40 billion dollars at auction, another 24 are loosening them for the European and Swiss central banks.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to counter or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group in a report for his clients.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can happen when they decided to do so," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to use the London interbank rate used to lend money between banks after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the heating up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now related to the end of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "Ein blauer, kein grüner Planet", he explained that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it's a word firework that's just a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
At the presentation of his book, the Czech president stressed that his subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet cartoons of my views."
Now interested parties could read his attitude undistortedly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he thought he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
He was, after all, academic, capable of understanding and judging technical papers, had experience in statistics and was also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore not a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptablely burdensome.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 motorists missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for an exchange, so that the authorities will be able to issue a new driver's license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the roads after the New Year without valid driving licences.
According to the authorities, mainly those who no longer want to drive have not changed their driving licence.
While small places report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of tickets, the offices of the capital are covered with applications, and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague about 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driver's license.
The exhibition of a new driver's license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay 500 kroner.
Motorists who fail to make the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license will face a fine from January onwards.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2,000 kroner.
However, the police can also keep it with an admonition in the event of transgression.
In the event of a breach, the penalty may rise to 2,500 crowns.
According to earlier information, the local authority may also be punished by a person who does not drive at all.
It was said that he could face a penalty of as much as 30,000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the offices to exercise mildness and to impose a penalty of at most 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand-dollar sentence.
The driving licence was a document in which everyone could decide whether or not to own it.
It is not an identity card that everyone, and a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
It is enough to take him to the relevant municipal office or send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who were accused of having shared with David Berdych's gang, were detained for 13 and 10 years respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organised Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's verdict, only revision to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also indicted in this case, but first of all he is facing the judgment of the first instance.
In other trials, however, he had already been punished for a total of 16 years.
He can't be sentenced to more than that.
In January, a district court convicted 19 persons, mainly for involvement in robbery, and the Oberlandesgericht today tried the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the prosecution from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with, among others, Berdych criminals, handed over information from sources of the police, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the loot.
The prosecution is about crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also for abuse of office and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser riflescope and a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns by its robberies.
Except for nearly 20 men in this trial, Berdych courts and a number of others found guilty of further robbery.
More men from Berdych's perimeter have to answer to another trial, and more cases have not yet been brought to court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish detention and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have escaped the main trial.
Children switched - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation from the hospital in Třebíč for 12 million crowns plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million, and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each couple of parents.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore completely disagrees with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," said Dostál after today's trial.
"But in order to be able to form an opinion on this counterproposal, we need the expert report that had the opposite side drawn up.
We'll find out if it's even meaningful.
However, we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all together," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, get along worse with the aftereffects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently happening, Veleba summed up the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district head of Vysočina (Bohemian-Märische Höhe) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a replacement for expenses incurred by the error of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally liable.
In case of doubt, they must apply for a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply to the institution for assistance.
To date, the courts have awarded relatively low amounts of compensation to those affected, the amounts have been determined by tables and ranged from hundreds of thousands to millions.
Polívka perished his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight over the brand "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, this is probably not over and his client is probably going to appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate parasiticly in Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
Everyone introduced himself to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachisches Reich".
The same opinion is also shared by Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money raising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a fight for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to get parasitic in our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his TV shows.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But at that time this was not related to the intention to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš thought of issuing Walachian passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged from an originally fun action, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachisches Königreich".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" programme for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka certainly helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today's divided parties lasted until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, culminating in the resignation of "King Boleslav I elected to the Saint Nimmerleins Day".
At the suggestion of Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková, the Queen's Mother took the lead.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
The contest prepared by Harabiš for the throne and half a princess could bring clarity in the dispute.
A new king was to emerge from this.
He didn't want to reveal details and an appointment.
"We don't want to rush.
It was supposed to be like the royal procession in Wallachia.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages are dwindling
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The combination with the designation SW is a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Keep moving quickly
I'm just going through the interior, not to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I only have objections because of the poor middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable and over are the times when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side support has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as the space available is concerned, one can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork here.
The already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated in the combo.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the cargo space.
I have to call this (also because of the fold-up back window) very well chargeable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with tethers that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling car in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains appreciably behind 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when inviting a stroller.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the flat cargo space after folding the rear seats or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, that's what a 1600 cubic engine should look like, driving a family hitchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare it to his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still goes on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment premium of the test car beats once again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric window lifter back and...
Thus, the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but put together the extra equipment of a Fabia and you'll get a very similar amount.
So the only thing left is to decide which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in UK schools does not succeed
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing fears among locals about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where disputes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment, and riots among students have spread to the relationship between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself by the fact that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bushy and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students from the Times newspaper described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In Great Britain, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported to come here looking for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak pupils are therefore attending British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
One of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, had it built, because everything that was considered a crime in the US (especially during prohibition) was gladly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.

Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, skyscrapers grew, across the wide boulevards drove cars, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of Havana's bodeguita.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have already fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Havanna, especially its oldest part, may have been badly run down, nowhere in the vicinity can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned up, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, along the coast of Holguín Province, and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers a moth that is unique in the world and attracts mainly railway lovers.
The sugar cane of remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been standing in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
Most of Cuba's visitors do not miss the most important places.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana anymore.
Just mention that there is a museum in Hemingway's already mentioned estate, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque spots in Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some people that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country in the fifties of the last century.
This isolation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factory".
In the evening one should then go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo there, must overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its World Heritage List, thanks to its untouched nature.
The best chocolate is produced there, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it was created about a hundred years after Columbus' journeys), and the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, is home to several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, about all this one could write many pages.
But, as they say, it's better to look at it with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, according to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, and in Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called for more activity for NATO units, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants themselves to start a further development of the economy and security," says British Secretary of Defense Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they call for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly, the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said today.
"I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop to the Reuters agency at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive?
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and where the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan non-stuer unmasked: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bildzeitung went on to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84,000 kroons.
The total debt increased to 842,7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to go into debt this year with 159.2 billion bills.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy.
The Czech Republic's national debt rose to 842,7 billion kroner by the end of September.
Thus, in the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on public debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech has a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the entire past year, the state was in debt of more than 111 billion kroner.
"So far, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion kroons until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion kroons," said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, sees the same thing: "We could come across a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take up to 2010.
But I don't expect such a change," he remarked.
Debt Growing
The debt of the state comes from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The public debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic public debt has now risen to 719,4 billion kroner this year.
The government's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached kroner 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"Over the year, total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the increase is mainly recorded in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something even before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to take up 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion kroner instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum of €13.3 billion planned for the consolidation agency, a ten-billion reserve to pay for pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and instalments of 1.8 billion for bonds with the European Investment Bank.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced to 15 days in prison and expulsion by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British were accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be flogged.
After several complaints from students to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School in Khartoum, was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam, according to Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very frequent first name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not bear a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simply that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knows her well, and that she had never done anything that could lead her to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in the class.
Consider that Mohammed's first name is also the second most frequently given in Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This given name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of homage to the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace is at stake in the region, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, called on them to fulfil their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of Conciliations on 10 December
The intermediaries of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet one last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika received the mandate from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, said Botswana-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After having been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is willing to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations of the last chance have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade for autonomy belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly advocating a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise is impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely and solely in the Security Council, where their Russian allies have a veto right.
Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word
Only one decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists were told by Fatmir Sejdiu that Kosovo's parliament would have the last word on status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would take place in consultation with the Western countries.
Bush unleashes an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He also said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them reach a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the road map for peace that they agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately aim for a peace treaty to resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems that mainly revolve around the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the wake of the 1948 conflict, which is located in the present state of Israel.
After the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide a settlement for all issues, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he pledged that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing its vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli that coexist, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks at the roots of the conflict and at its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab prince writes in his interview with the Arab-language daily newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are faced.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation carried out by the National Disciplinary Office of the Police (IGPN), a police car drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
He had no mission, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman to the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without registration, so not released for public traffic (see below), came, driven by two young people without helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its driveway from the right, a policeman further explained.
The alcohol control carried out during the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (dragged fender, splintered windshield, torn bumper) shows the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main public safety department of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the D.A. declared that it excluded the IGPN from the responsibility of the police at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police officers, namely that this small wheel arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of grooves, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained tangled in each other until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of a technical evaluation.
The bodies of the two victims were induced yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious error in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation for which further investigations are necessary and where care must be taken.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth one on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue workers arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police force did not provide any help to the young people.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed in her turn.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday, Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations since two days before General Musharraf proclaimed the emergency.
According to testimonies, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the emergency measures had been injured by the tear gas shells used by the police there.
Those then threw stones to hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court's bar have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by oppositionists, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful coalition Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the people to send flowers to the judges who opposed the emergency, and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
Pakistan's Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News said.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give command of the army and become a civilian president has not been valid since the invocation of the emergency, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ended.
The Vice-Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception, such as the pill or spiral, still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the institute, which found that the percentage of pill users aged between 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless made it possible to better control fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births today are carefully planned.
At one of five couples even calculated on the month accurately, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Space Shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to take in the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5 ton module for generating electricity via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew decided to restructure the solar panels of the module with a span of 76 metres.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the Discovery space shuttle for a control walk and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meter long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to perform repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very clever, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After careful examination of the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed a kind of rail on the damaged spot.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey bat, wrapped with an insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had been conceived and made by the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the Discovery space shuttle today, in order to be expected to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
Following the announcement by the Aviation and Defence Group that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros in order to counteract the A400M residues, EADS currently shows a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the residues caused by the slow development of the engine of the A400M, which delay the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month lag.
As a reminder, EADS's business performance fell from 86% in 2006 due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the urns: the mass of Russians will vote for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message on the public channels to the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when the President received the foreign ambassadors, he was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interfering - his favorite subject during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have failed to do so.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there have never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-Chess World Champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, according to his lawyer continues to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much more questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
The term of office announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, which will choose government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power to date will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus, they are not the master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St Petersburg goes even further: In this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe, civil society has developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin once again followed the model of a paternalist state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
Why think for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A Difficult Memorabilia
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen for a total length of 27 km, have not yet been read, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, to consult a former victim or his/her relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, which are responsible for their administration, agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Hot information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the state of health of forced labourers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoners' lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One should not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, explained Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing Free Trade Agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson .
Europe is the first or second market for the ten products most frequently exported by India, the European Commissioner continued. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion each year and services worth EUR 10 billion, this week Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's delegation to New Delhi, said, and regretted that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about curtailing the current recurring anxiety about credit terms and announced an offer of £10 billion with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are supposed to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase starting on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , in a communication.
The Bank further declares that on December 6th at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the property tax rate and only until January 10th.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE is circulating liquidity for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the inter-Bänkian interest rates at their basic interest rate, which vary from day to day.
The interbank rate varied from day to day on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has stabilised to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with fines that had prevented the banks from using them.
According to certain rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is a rejection of the text.
The text, created as part of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, of which the bulk was for the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIP, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to partly violent exchanges of views between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television broadcast on purchasing power.
The leader of the MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of their proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of the finances, which had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, told Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most prestigious festivals.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he's ever attended, says that his company and Melvin Benn's work are parallel to each other to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We've chosen Philadelphia as a market and we're busy working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Luckily we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival back to life at Grand Park Chicago, after being featured together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival in 2002.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax assets.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours is more in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts in order at the same time to convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way in the American way."
Vineland is located halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is delighted to take on the burden of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no one less than the Terminator opposes it.
These attempts are part of the delegate's tasks.
A politically "heikle's mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The Oscars' hunt has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although Sundance's, Denver's, Seattle's, or San Francisco's, it's all about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them, and making sure the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing an end-year rally? Disunity among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the annual financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the coming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not if serious tensions determine the current market situation
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants, who invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which is severely affected by the rising trend towards profitable assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock exchange will tend to show a more lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US Federal Reserve interest rate, an uncertainty mainly due to the rise in crude oil prices and the risk of inflation.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its highest mark on 8 November of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional pension fund grant every year at that time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could develop a little differently this year, mainly because of the end-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the assessment of the market situation so far is at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values which depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of the values that should drive the Ibex to new heights.
Solana of Intermoney asserts that this year is the turn of the great values.
Value winners would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases in the banking and industrial sectors will be accompanied by the increase.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on track in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, according to the expert.
With regard to increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine the market situation in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has seen only two declines in price trends.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally so far.
This year, in which Ibex 35 caught up with 28.17 percentage points, December saw a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has been increasing by 8.36% since January) and can also have a final year rally will be shown.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in Spain's strongest economic regions.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches weekdays to 20.30h and start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definite decision.
The current negotiations between the Bank and the trade unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement at which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with her project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, can capture the buyers of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The expansion of opening hours is thus combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more contemporary, colourful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring would not require major investments, but would be accompanied by increased recruitment, as a branch no longer required six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We don't want to compete with our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally come to an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the close of the stock exchange. The channel he was running had increased its value by twice that of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, goodwill now reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, with a market value of 2,193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other publicly listed communications companies is rising; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 can be seen from the fact that it is two similar companies.
There is still uncertainty as to the extent to which we can actually act on the market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
One week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first television station to receive more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues this year, insuring Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the Group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the market (up to 734,4 million), while net revenue from the television business increased only by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco's better stock market performance compared is the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show up to now: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría initiated a 100% dividend distribution.
Vasile assures, however, that after the purchase of 33% of Endemol's shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, the ratio may still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
It also reduced Antena 3's expected profit calculation for 2008 by 4.5% and by 7.5% for 2009.
Three options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buying) measures a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (stopping) as a result of the multiple incentives and the flourishing market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends reducing expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID's policy, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary preparation, which ended its session today with the Congress decision in the Senate on the additional/amendment requests related to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate members who, in their negotiations and votes, had aimed to establish the best possible regulation, which ensures the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which re-determines the investment services regulations, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive makes it possible to provide financial advice to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consultancy companies that are associated with investment and brokering companies of securities.
It also expands the number of financial transaction execution systems, adding the multilateral securities trading systems and the internationalisation of trading orders that would eventually compete with the current economic actors.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the focus of their company profile, confrontation and ways of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate CNMV's control task.
The Congress's Economic Commission made further changes in retrospect, with the decision that the title-based bond must now be regarded as complex financial resources due to its high degree of risk for the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of qualified economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the business mediator, who works on behalf of others, does not need authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (CPI) rose by five-tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare the location and quality of US products by publishing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely by applying the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the early indicator would only serve as a benchmark and therefore would not have to match the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development, while at the same time confirming that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , in the halls of the Congress building Solbes noted that even if the current figure is not good , the difference in inflation between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Economy and Finance Minister announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates revenues of over 42 billion euros with Northern Rock over the next three years
Northern Rock's portfolios have fallen by more than half after the Bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in the middle of September last year, due to the crisis, and they now amount to only £12,000 million (i.e. €16,800 million).
At that time, the bank's assets amounted to a record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to the customer's loss of confidence and, despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, must contribute about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be composed of the investments of the next three years, to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve its target of 30 billion.
The group of the multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend £50,000 million (approximately €70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for suspected participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of Totano (Partido Popular), a municipality belonging to the municipality of Murcia, on the grounds of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales last May, currently a member of the Popular Partido and, at that time, chairman of the Municipal Council of Totana, and, according to information from Cadena SER, could be the original mastermind of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Town Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and therefore privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's residence on the basis of important incriminating documents that are to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report Morale's supposed order payments to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract, in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in pre-trial detention.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a socialist election victory, take over the office of President of the Congress.
Thus José Blanco, organising secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
In the view of the Heads of Government, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to be running as the leader of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who announced last November 15 that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, end his career in public politics and instead campaign for climate protection in the university field.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had been constantly pushing for his return to political action.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to deprive the citizens of who would take over the post of President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and called this an act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or outcry, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time you get the impression that the only place you can't talk calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the President of the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work, suggesting that he did not seem to have taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call this an arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate pitilessly criticises both the sceptics of climate change and those who focus on social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even proposing to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, puts him in a need for a declaration of action or non-action by his government, which has played a decisive role in ensuring that Spain is at the top of those countries that have least fulfilled the Kyoto Protocol's requirements within the EU.
Who are those responsible for failing to meet the requirements, which sectors are responsible for this, and why did their government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stop this development?
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take against climate change.
Which companies will be affected by this, which behaviour of the citizens will be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and which economic consequences will result from this.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there are and will be no such statements in the future.
It's precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures that can be used to combat climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed to Zapatero to be so dangerous, in a strategic way, that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise well-suited politician does not have to talk, complain, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his meekness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with one fan.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to a supposed involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of Murcia's town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur have been detained for suspected urban violations, according to investigators.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the arrests that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land for urban development projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria should be remodelled, which should build 4000 flats on the property after the local administration gave it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subject to an investigation initiated and carried out by the First Court of Totona.
The first six detainees were presented to the judge today.
According to investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales is also being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The president and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company acts as a subgroup of Nuaria and is said to have received the bribe.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban development offences, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming industry, which is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which would include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which had to be rebuilt. The aim was to realize a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price name of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study) published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, which comments on the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; incidentally, on the day the review of the book of Blackburn was published.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate who quoted Plato's and Nietzsche's works in his news.
In an interview by the daily Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, Chairman of the Philosophy Education Council, called on teachers to take a more critical position over Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching be removed from the lower-level curricula for philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which would involve six months of imprisonment.
But if you rob a music business below a value of 400 euros again, this is only a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a crime, but the penalty is lower than in a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than in a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious dispute results in a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is regarded as less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, the author's authorization of which has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has really screwed up his demands.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings generated by the monthly salary pay depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was conducted using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science journal.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answer and thus received the same level; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her seat of office is in the prosecutor's office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and a laughing eye, because the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - are the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Her names are on the list of Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a model for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York with the pace of a political thriller in her plan to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which again depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of production of the driver's licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the right vehicle insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit the corresponding severance payment in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance which is composed of several factors, including age, sex, the time when the driving licence is drawn up, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, who, according to statistical data and therefore also to the firm's conviction, tend to suffer fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefit of the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequently the use, the more likely the damage.
In drawing up the premium, insurance must take account of a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best suits his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points that should be considered when selecting an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
Under 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles when choosing a low-cost insurance policy, such as low driving practice and a young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to complete a comprehensive insurance, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can select a full-scale with excess, so that the services of a full-scale insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount incurred by the damage himself.
The amount is fixed before the contract is concluded and the amount of the insurance premium is higher than the sum to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by the own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hands to reduce insurance costs, so your credit will increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. This is due to the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it is most appropriate to opt for a fully comprehensive insurance with excess.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their experience so far, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the beginner's fear has been discarded.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable to take out comprehensive insurance for a married customer who does not have children; of course only if the financial situation of the relevant person permits it.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full insurance with excess (with an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In the case that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance, which will only be used for the third year of the vehicle, is recommended.
Luis Noguera notes that they drive more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to pay a higher contribution.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full insurance with excess (with an amount of 150 euros) or an extended insurance, which will only apply if a sufficiently high credit is credited.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it involves high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes for the final in Milan
Milan FC and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point in San Siro next Tuesday that they lack to reach their respective goals before the final of the Championsleague preliminary round. Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow needs another with nine points to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not win the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan FC will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time for entry to the final on the 13th in the semi-final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished ahead of everyone else and the draw at Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. Italians will not want to speculate at home, the Celtics know Glasgow that in the event of a victory they would be group first and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan's team could even be enough to qualify for a defeat in a slump of Shakhtar FC. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win in the second match (2-0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to avoid the Scotsman the evening. Again, they hope to reach the eighth final of the remodeled Championsleague for the second time in a row after they have been defeated by a goal of Kaka in the replay time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the match.
While Shakhtar is waiting for Rossoneri's victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth final and joining UEFA will depend on their victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls Tour concert in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in the wake of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to see the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the band's history, which caused a stir in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two other new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice , the English footballer David Beckham, had given them before.
The athlete was among the crowds who made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him to do so in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star did not see our wardrobe once, and therefore I am very curious what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 resulted in the dissolution of the group two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed, that feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm commented on the separation of the band that had caused it nine years ago.
The singer also stated that the disputes were eliminated and that they were all very fond of each other again.
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls' last appearance together in 1998.
First of all, according to a report from CTV, the group arrived in a special Virgin Airlines machine in Vancouver.
Upon her arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is fading between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports being affected by fuel to Western Europe.
Most of Russia's natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are channelled through Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia for higher transit charges.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during talks," said Ukraine's Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters news agency.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas deposits, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve controls on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said one member of the control body.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in connection with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish National Health Service did not have any precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road vehicle was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
The National Health Service is expected to carry out checks prior to the appointment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main examiner's report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record extract that help employers with controls in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, they have not been carried out routinely," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative guidelines to a large extent before hiring, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health care workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks ahead of the deployment of potential NHS staff.
"The report states that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was probably higher, also because the board members had problems identifying those employees who were on leave indefinitely.
The investigation also found that established control procedures were largely complied with by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for pre-employment controls for foreign staff in the NHS.
Nicola Sturgeon, Secretary of Health, said: "It was my concern to do this work in the face of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the report's recommendations and ensure that best practices would be reflected in updated guidance on control investigations prior to the appointment of all staff, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled for next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, among others for the best film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded as the best leading actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for putting the British film into the world public.
The prizes were handed over in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - found on its soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was shot for only £3 million.
Nevertheless, he has won two prizes for the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director's debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the prize for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who stands in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the prize named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 Arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on clergy and security forces.
The world's largest oil exporter's state television said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants led by a foreign citizen planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect plants after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the prisoners belonged to a cell headed by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 detainees were planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shia Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a huge effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior told state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on an orbit shows that the planet resembles an averted twin of Earth even more than was previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbour to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have dominated conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable, scientists today believe.
But because of the unchecked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotational pace, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the space probe Venus Express of the European Space Agency, which has examined the planet for a year, provide a sobering view of how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It's all still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally agreed to engage in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded questions on video and submitted them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party that is going to vote next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with the YouTube clips to show the prospective candidate.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest dedicated to a single theme, immigration was the focus.
The issue is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a dial when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed tips of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the call that he was yielding to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney by accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly concerned as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, were able to follow up on this issue.
Neither of the two men has serious chances of being nominated, but they both stay in the race, perhaps because they hit the immigration spauke sooner and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: stricter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported weapons restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to argue that although the Bible was his preferred book, he might not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations, in first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When urged to support Jesus, he laughed about it and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his by-catch storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been shot up out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
This is not particularly slippery for British scandals.
No aristocratic titles seem to have been sold, no Parisian hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has covered up donations to the British ruling Labour Party for over 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have done well without the struggling Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister withdrew from the demand for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British, claiming that polls did not influence this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly perceptive leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has developed into Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under attack.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought corporate associations against the government.
The loss of personal data by 25 million people by the tax authorities revealed unimaginable administrative fussing.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the manifold donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's secretary general (and her former executive director) has already resigned.
None of this means Brown's irrevocably breaking off.
Yet governments can reach a turning point at which they feel it impossible to govern.
People do not like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is starting to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax records, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's mishaps - as in the long "money for nobility titles" investigation of political party financing - voters may assume it was him.
Still, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks
The misconduct is not as terrible as the Conservatives describe it.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely deceived.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's, of course, Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new call for political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abrahams, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish for public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but he was not entitled to make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself a few questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief financial collector, who was told about the weird donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to make the measure full by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, "the lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding something permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unfilled for six months, and moving forward with a radical reform of political party financing.
That would require from the hardliners of Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to abandon the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a partymate like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; they have two years to win back voters; and the only way to achieve victory is through unchallenged righteousness and solid competence.
Map sharks
Is the credit crisis causing America's credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's just natural that back fins swirl excitedly around.
Now that America's real estate market is offended, the predators are targeting the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion spreads from underfunded loans to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both offsetting and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or more than 30 days late.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion charge from its American consumer finance, partly because of the weakness of credit card recipients.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter maturity rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large part of the loss of the Kedit card; the number of applications (and therefore default fees) would increase again, whether the general conditions for borrowers worsen or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much consumers pay off their debts every month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the 2007 expenditures will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debt, now that home loans dry up.
However, the card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for the card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates will decrease if the real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt will become more important among the redemption priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and revalue the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main finance officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former Chief Financial Manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for alleged conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK in the course of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastov's attention to the fact that he was the aim of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless deceptive Enron powers that helped to tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it had a significant value in reality.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's stake in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charges, Fastow wrongly represented with Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others suspected about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charges.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison term in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and a month in a Texarkana facility.
Each of the three men was at large on the basis of a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks no longer allowed the billions of debt to appear profitable or weakening companies.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion in market value, and more than two billion dollars in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is punishing more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were annulled after he died last year for heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least $54 million.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it's for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires Exhibition, a four-day orgy of showcased consumption, held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built exhibition stands, hoping to attract new money from Russians to everything, from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"It's a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas did in its heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in flocks where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's most visible generous financial issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the Gold Rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, Chairman of LVMH, have attracted to share ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, which have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived under the minimum subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
For the first time, she had attended the trade fair together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all perfectly cared for and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they go through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus primarily on the new wealthy, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic for several hours to visit a large warehouse, which shamelessly placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick Ice Cream, tailor-made Billiard Tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bears side by side.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
Indeed, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the type of sober brand with limited quantities that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simply tourists, rushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company sold the bright orange Porsche for 170,000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, said that he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same chain armbands as each other, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost is $22,000 for a quadruple.
"The Russian millionaire who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the increase in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red telephone booths full of mountains of false million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw the piles of money around, mobile phone photos, while they sit back in the middle of the spare wealth, sniping from friends, or just taking a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Broken operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving Day when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's coroner's van approach," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead wife Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a procedure performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who was working in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help to clear up a mysterious death that has sent a mourning by the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control committee, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unapproved surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday nobody opened the door to Mrs Castro's house, where a withered rose shrub stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find his way around the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to an increase in world stock markets
The stocks jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest-rate cuts were reinforced by appeased comments from the US Central Bank Vice-Chairman.
Stock markets increased in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, number two by Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Central Bank, said that policy must respond "flexible and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm troubled markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "in part reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to intervene and stabilize the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The statements also helped to calm Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the US economy, now that US real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost reduction measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage lending sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 Index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the UK standard value.
Germany's index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined, after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds granted to the European Central Bank to the European commercial banks was granted at a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed further funds into the money markets in London increased when the credit tensions were seen to rise to 6.59% in the three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks at their peak since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's gonna be number six for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, on appeal at least under this special title, is here to help the head coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling with applications for national electoral offices, if not for those in part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets above the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time to climb up Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a cricket player is unless they are given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities to do so.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular chances of order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind is pounding into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference after all.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling at that time to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough to a major test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion in today's Asgiriya Stadium web session.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debuts in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent record against turned balls speaks.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May versus West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the picks as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his blow, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a shovel of joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything in a cricket court and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently overturned a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from afar, and enthusiastically say, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he kegs his middle speed with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the actual art of selection.
I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean Shah might not look good when, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he's the one who's gonna play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels that had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operating with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, with regard to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to put back at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia helped drive Al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaidas.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been enticed by the increasing tranquillity in the capital since the U.S. military increase and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who were armed and defend their neighborhoods in cooperation with the American military.
But more was said to have been forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis no longer to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house down after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will fuel sectarian tensions and conflict will occur.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarlander push the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Aarlander that we are not French" - this slogan placates the smallest federal state self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln (IW).
For example, universities cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from a tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high with 15.6 percent.
But also the state children bring the Saarland in above average number to the universities - many of them without a degree at the Gymnasium.
"The vocational education system is being used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their qualification at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also comparatively strong.
In terms of population, the provision of dual courses of study is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms at the general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
For children to start learning earlier, the last day care year is free of charge - a model that has since been copied by other federal states.
Whether pupils' performance will improve sustainably will only be demonstrated in future comparative studies.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians calculate better.
And in order to discourage the Saarlanders, language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could score points otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is obligatory at high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks around
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joker.
According to a new law, Venezuela's Official Gazette reports that clocks are set to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The anti-U.S. Chávez justified his decision by, among other things, the fact that the United States imposed the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) about a hostage affair the termination of relations with the neighboring country Colombia.
The left nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is pushing forward a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribe's decision to evade Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia to release hostages.
Uribe had "spooked Venezuela in the face" with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new cell phone ringer is causing a stir in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who at the recent Ibero-American summit had been annoyed by the constant calls of the left-wing populist and had run over his mouth.
German threatens 2007 wage minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to face a real wage loss this year.
Experts cited a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect in real terms less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price cuts for food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also be imposed on employees in the case of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products has driven inflation to the highest level in 13 years.
Total prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortexes at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have been suggesting that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided proof - it detects electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "prime soup theory", lightning has caused life on Earth to develop: thunderstorms have stimulated reactions in the ocean that have led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, with temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
" Venus may be the devil's will on Earth, but it's a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the beginning of the nineties no longer a probe was on its way specifically for the exploration of this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa informs.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air flows in the terrestrial winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-tinnerest planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the Sun in just under 225 days.
But it revolves much slower around itself: a Venus Day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly resembles the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have emerged under very similar conditions.
Both gathered water that remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the large coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but protected Merkel from the accusation that she was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from among the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, about the Union's "show window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the chancellor's office, there was severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
According to the SPIEGEL, the Chinese leadership not only unloaded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China rejects the fact that when European politicians officially receive the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other today's provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything had to be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany would not be discharged into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to ensure that we do not build up social explosives and discharge them in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal, state and local authorities were already working hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This does not only concern the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this already shows first successes."
However, it is too early for a warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, youths had delivered heavy street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings also burned.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the federal government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there was still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people with a migrant background under 25 was "more than average".
More training places had to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany, more than in France, "social control takes place in families".
In addition, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to be careful."
He stressed that young people had to be given the "quick opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of the police were in action, a helicopter flew over the area with spotlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, an array of around 1000 security forces has been providing rest.
The police would go through as long as it was necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, about 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots ignited in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor's far-reaching appearance documents that the coalition is at the end of its content - and that nothing can be expected of her.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After their bleak appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was prodigious and poor in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that must finally be governed by it.
Angela Merkel rejected the allegation that she was too focused on foreign policy with a pretentious sentence.
This is provincial, she said, and only showed that she does not want to understand what the critics are all about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented for everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a retired politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in the approximate even there.
For example, climate protection: it praises itself unchecked for the decisions taken by Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodestity the CDU boss would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing comes to the people.
It damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of making the world look beautiful.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low earners?
She's got a few extra sentences left for that.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to the child supplement.
Merkel needs three attempts to bring out a halfway straight sentence.
She stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have made a hard trade - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already unloaded on the first topic.
He had made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
In turn, he counters with serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a port for illegals," Giuliani replied, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of having privately employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than keyword readers.
"With this kind of isolationism we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a strong reading from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida show that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause is aroused in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, scrambled, asking the base and television audience for him to be one of the pro-abortionists in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into a snare when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani leader Musharraf has been sworn in as president.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had given up his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus bowing to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his oath, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency and thereby meet another Western demand.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four were injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies plays again: The three band members of Harmonia performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
A recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears for the revival.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The arranged sensation occurs then in the form of three set gentlemen on the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle of a flower white shirt with 63 years of age.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, turns concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds up to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band is playing Harmonia again has caused some excitement among herbrock lovers.
But you can reveal here: Targeted inquiries showed that the name swirled through the collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainable, in order to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock was always more valid in England and America than in one's own country.
When the music industry gave the survivors of Cologne's Can group the Echo-Prize for Life's Work in 2003, the audience saw in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the amazement knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later squatted on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the foreign world is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a far less effective power than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had helped out briefly at Kraftwerk and then as a guitarist at Neu!, the then perhaps most radical German group, gained a reputation.
Around 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Alte Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-voluntary communes.
Less ideologically than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague herself as a nanny.
It's more like being a shrewd artist.
Allegedly there was also a pennant of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein in the bulk waste and a name for art.
Some of them held on to Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following album "De Luxe".
For as calm and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
Rice collecting was not just for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50 people, as someone believes to remember.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flamming Hearts".
Clusters were revived in the eighties and have since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating Krautrock as its own German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's the Loveparade inventor, Dr. Motte.
With which the entire range of influences of the Krautrock would be outlined on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the blank space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's movement floats in the hall with the most strange sounds: "The only true music, the future belongs to her."
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the Bauernstube.
Legend formation is used for projections of further black-and-white photographs of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums, in order to elicit unheard sounds from the instruments via self-made effect devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technical technicians.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are coughed and whisked and sung in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Who calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia will not let it get out of its way even now.
Even the most natural thing is thoroughly covered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mörderischer Frieden" two films deal with the Balkan war again.
But both don't convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and ballers or they are too touching.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but especially there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties, because too many nice and inconsequential roles in wellness films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drive the desire for a look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter gets hunted" (Why do film titles have to be as long today and confused as train drivers' collective agreements?) after all.
He delivers a wonderfully eye-catching portrayal: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has his very best times long behind him, but who has preserved, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, considerable remnants of the former charm.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party", together with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from Kosovan snipers, and one of them is in love with them.
Although it is welcome that not the Serbs are portrayed here as the sole root of all evil, the television-flat film loses itself too quickly in ballers and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for that with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the Fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and scriptwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are quite similar: both times small teams go into the forest to do something the military can't do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt isn't just being the run-down cynic with heart when he's introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also conjure up a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down when the reporters succeed in the last five minutes of the time-lapse procedure in what Nato, CIA and all bounty hunters in the world have failed in five years: catching the war criminals and leaving them to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that they want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinematic logic.
In doing so, the film has a profoundly human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should exceptionally agree) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I see with compassion the swollen frontal veins, indicating: how exhausting it is to be evil".
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same gossip, but they indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently in this newspaper it has been reported that all Iraq movies were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always applies: If a star is drifting around the world's hot spots or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" which are now considered classics have not been unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes in real time on two screens at home, just too much about the conflicts in the world.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the unconcern that it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really prevailed.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastic distanced artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied, "That's just because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for Olympic cancellation
The abridgement of the mayor from Hamburg's application for the Olympic Summer Games has come up with fierce criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games by the water.
But von Beust exhorts realism to assess the opportunities.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a waiver as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed such great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sport-policy momentum would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which starts from a changed timeline".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust stayed with earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Confederation," said von Beust WORLD ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund on an application from Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, which was expected at the beginning of December.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have a realistic chance in the period up to 2028 that we have thought of so far."
Nevertheless, the dream is not dreamed out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build up an opportunity by burying the plans already at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application was also contrary to the statement of the Senate Chief at a reception at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There, von Beust called Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 "not as a substitute" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD citizenship faction accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleine Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has placed on the map Olympia and excluded housing," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for Kleine Grasbrook had always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of housing, the CDU had unilaterally relied on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had aroused a great deal of enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg had failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, fabricated wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue of works in Sweden.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there are forgeries of the Stockholm type.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes of 1968 a few months ago, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now leads to a sobering result: The six "Brillo Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the approximately one hundred other Brillo Boxes of the "Skip Stockholm" type, which are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is intertwined, a confusing concatenation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these did not come from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
These were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at that time were rightly included in the art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Style Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden crates were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has examined the six museum's own Brillo boxes, three of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press plates were first primed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press chipboard with a paint roll without a primer - moreover, it is not oil but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibitions."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious accusations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have been shrouded in relentless silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who were hiding in a hotel in Manila demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillane, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Governmental soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked the district around the superior hotel.
The President called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said that other army units were about to join the march.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption charges for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main venue of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The insurrection failed after just under 24 hours because of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
