What should it do, the ČSSD? Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort, nor the "Conditorei".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city council at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has "knocked off" some members of the new council from the ČSSD, as they dominate the notorious slang, which has become naturalized in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by Lord Mayor Pavel Bém of Prague's political elite in the past, is borrowed from some of the most well-known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed that these new concepts are something in the dark.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer in Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "patent vocabulary".
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of Slang."
From the vocabulary published by the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the ODS election congress, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those which are notoriously linked to the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "largest Prague golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "animal nacks", "betrayal of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even lose the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the Civil Democrats talk to each other."
"For me, it's important how we understand each other in our programs," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized in the above mentioned headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of ex-Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed in the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure can be found and what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to some Prague restaurant," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he asserts that he had drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly naturalized slang among the social democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called by his party members salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and see - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the party members of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself by machinations at the party sponsoring before the elections, is called "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues.
So nicknames are the only thing that social democrats allow in their inner-party language.
Hulínský does not like it when it is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the rubber stick rights" is allegedly due to the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They tend to belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for health reasons, for example, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women "becomes a witch", she will be severely isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women are spared this, too, as they help with work and give birth to children," a nun describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, where more than a hundred women were expelled from their communities in a special home.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure to prevent the "witch tracking".
It's got a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "the standard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
However, being accused of witchcraft is commonplace in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men – they poured petroleum over her and just lit her.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter had only been a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
And that's after the group tried to "expel" "an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports the people here regardless of their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "The eating of human souls is a danger as it is today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian president has been involved in a proper way last year by the president himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
"He called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and took them to the president's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detained people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant from Bakala: Although he heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older supported man is leaving the client centre of RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases to three flats: for his own and the flats of his daughters and his son, who is serving a prison sentence.
All three of them have just been increased in rent under the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is to be able to cover next year for a 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 kroner.
"And there's not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he says with his finger on the son's new lease, for whose signature he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-disturbed and half-resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "correct and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, where they intend to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just waved off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulatory laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid a market-oriented rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device at her.
"Rent 2011", a special touch screen lights up on the touch screen.
Briefly typed and already the device spits out a number sheet.
Hardly did we decipher the number "157" and already it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance issues and so on.
From mid-November, the Kuverts in the Ostrava region, with the new leases, will float into the mailboxes for most tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the portfolio of the RPG.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letters a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for new rentals in the client centre has been open since November 18th.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's just the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' homes are a critical issue.
Before the elections, the parliamentary vice-president from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD, had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder the newspapers are full of it today.
"For twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change toilet glasses," says the man mentioned at the beginning.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the counter to see if they really get the promised tenant discount that RPG promises if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent until 15 December.
So far, however, "deregulatory switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded by requests.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here," the counter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as on wall panels, where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not meant to be a threat, but rather to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," explains RPG on his websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street in front of the client centre agrees with her at least in part.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which 5,000 are left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employees get insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them not to sign the media, so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is, according to the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion dollars in housing from the rents it received between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red glowing information appears in between.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"This always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month", is read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents up sharply, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: all the income from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and thermal insulation.
But - priority should be given to those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
The architectural and design firm Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known Brno buildings come, reckoned from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini kindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby boom age and the company is concerned that the project assistants will return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social program.
The civil engineers have it so easier to reconcile their demanding profession and child care.
The Mini Kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to attract funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company's mini kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and the Czech Republic's State Budget.
Thanks to this financing (compensation of CZK 2,8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and qualified staff and operations are provided for a period of 2 years.
After the utilization of the funds (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application process.
The children are fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini kindergarten, only 5 children are allowed to be present at the same time, however, the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten company is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is a matter of individual education and care, the programme content in the mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, while they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus avoid the stress of late picking up the children from a far away kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships also develop here.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, who are family-friendly and support their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn up fish owls.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The local inhabitants nicknamed the house "Knochenhaus" with its organic forms.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiled splinters and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau by Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
Only when you look more closely do you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
At night, the entire façade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colours.
The same sweeping lines and intertwined forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and mouldings.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house dating from 1877, which was designed by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed with Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló house was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
On its drawing board the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá house in Park Güell, which also houses works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed "Knochenhaus" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "gowning house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces that was unique at the time.
Her 45-degree inclination seems a bit bizarre.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations of that time and was by no means misled by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified at the completion two years later by the result that they demanded remedy.
The councillors also argued, among other things, that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the district's request to do so, Josep Batlló applied for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social lounge, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by the opening of the salon doors and thus a larger society could comfortably chat without having to renounce a certain intimacy during more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new façade, Gaudí's renovation also provided the house with a rather unusual roof and two further floors.
Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the courtyards are also impressive.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colours, which on the contrary absorb sunlight.
Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
The homeowners only decided in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a rather profitable business, the visits were kept, even extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price to visit the monument is not a cardboard handle, however, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards receive 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed top? Women have different wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the concrete user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
The interior, in which mattress and rust are subordinated, is just as important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where there is no regular heating, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "warm up".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
Because if they don't have enough ventilating cans in the core and are still lying on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: So it is not excluded that under their mold forms.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you're used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Well, all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep properly here anymore."
"For their worn shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (memory foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"Among other things, I recommend sugar-sick people who suffer from nervous system disorders, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why I bought these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam) years ago for many ice hockey players, but also for other customers.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among others the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the advantages of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it nestles in the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, in the night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles of the foot to the height, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is 180 cm tall, needs such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of lying width, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholsterers and interior decorators, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years and who also presents this topic at specialist schools.
With a double bed each needs its own rust and its own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else is left but to mount the rusts at different heights and that is far from possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be allocated to the mould layer and the fine cushion.
"With your hand or while sitting down, you can't feel the feathers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay like co-grown Siamz twins have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since one loses between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifetime guarantee, for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, do not shy away from the hygiene of washable, removable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even if today mattress covers are usually made with all-round zipper, so that you get two halves after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often looks like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get it out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should use the plate with ventilation holes (unless there are any in it) and mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a backing.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (also combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable slatted grates with 14 to 18 slatted strips (lamels), always paying off with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 or more slatted strips, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility to regulate the slat hardness.
On adjustable slatted gratings do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special attachment of the spring strips, which enables the spring strips to be pressed in or even angled in such a way that they allow the point-by-point sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rusts with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and proper rust, most advantages are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should reach only to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears ideal, as the Scandinavians like it, for example.
In the lateral position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
The new magic word "organic" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils - such as castor and soya oil - are increasingly used to produce polyurethane foams.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is the name of mattresses, which are made of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scents while sleeping.
Here, too, you make a difference between man and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used in men so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have a "warming" effect.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes pleasantly warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and much more flexible).
The combination of the various stiffnesses (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heel are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to cover.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco foam with a quilted cover for CZK 11,990.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic speed.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the launch.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
So it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but also generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to make the legs and vessels easier.
Local manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear of one's own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for the search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been terrified by the disappearance of Anička, so they look for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be abuses of such devices in individual cases, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without knowing about it, but we haven't had such a case yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"The mobile phones at first aroused great expectations with the parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers locating services for both cars and persons, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In case of more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to play in a special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that this is either a matchbox-size device that resembles trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There's always a danger of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a surveillance or tracking device.
"Or he only notices after a certain time what gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter which direction the development is going - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle tracking.
So the combination of the tracking function with the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you could wrap all the Czech Republic around you but only hold two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of fuses, are lit with explosives.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have taken care of 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the fuse - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the fuse from the public limited company STV Group, a. s. for leopard 40 million crowns.
In his statement for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the general staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would use up to the 60 km of ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES referred to, this statement shows that the entire army must undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of fuses.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of each new professional soldier two meters of ignition line is completely sufficient, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units.
Recently, soldiers from the Rapid Operations Brigade complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises are severely restricted due to the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I don't understand why they buy so many fuses from us."
But that is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as a dealer would like to meet as much as possible," says the sales manager of STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of fuses by saying that the army would have covered up with this "Munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the fuses and police and army pyrotechnicians only two years.
"With perfect storage the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
At the end of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not for free, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the volume discount for the 445 km ignition line.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's 244-kilometre delivery," Spokesman Pejšek tells us about the position of buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of fuses by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brother army has been over 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of these ammunition, which they can consume before the end of the period of use.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, you also keep the possibility for flexible purchases more modern and thus also reliable fuses open.
The Ministry of Defence has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who approached MF DNES, the Czech armed forces are expecting in a few years the same problem with the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old fuses, which they have purchased so "favorably" today.
To this day, the contacts I have won thanks to the competition have been in my possession.
Lukáš Pytloun's winning position in the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" helped sell his hotel's franchise.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of the last year of the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year".
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings from his vacation work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-semester student at the time, this was certainly a brave undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back in the house, which he converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in just seven years of business activity in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of Pytloun-Hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"Large share of this license sale to operate hotels just had the victory in the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year", adds Mr. Pytloun acknowledging.
The victory has brought him greater awareness, even popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to do something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at the same time, every visualisation is good.
He says that to this day he has benefited from the contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise not have been the case.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships today."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also a little reflected on each of his employees.
And there he is at the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I really don't see this as just a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has only come to the fore a little bit," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year when we had it in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst.
The prize for the first place of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the last year was awarded to Karel ŽŻárský, the owner of Farmet.
At that time, the jury praised the efforts he made to stamp out a small toolmaking company in Česká Skalice that generated hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encourages myself, but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history was the effort to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered a small workshop for lease to its father Karel ŽŻárský as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he was busy until then, and with a few comrades of his father founded his own company for the manufacture of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through success in the above-mentioned competition and its medialization that it also entered the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
"Not only that our customers perceive the Farmet brand more intensively, our foreign partners also began to attach greater value to the fact that they were able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel ŽŻárský.
The past year, however, was not only a sign of victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool making products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less the citizens, but above all companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to discontinue their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"Sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel ŽŻárský
A viable company sometimes needs to take such unpopular measures.
But it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to cut back on investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre out of the grant, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and obtained major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says ŽŻárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel ŽŻárský.
An opinion poll that cleans up with nonsense rules
The opinion poll on the "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the entrepreneur competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless rules have already managed to get out of the world.
As the dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online has become increasingly important.
For example, more than a third of less than four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have called it up by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register for checks on social security payers in the future," said the spokesperson for ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to lift the nonsense.
For the fourth time this year, this is part of an entrepreneur competition organized by the tsch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoying growing popularity among the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"In terms of the number of income tax forms, for example, we are in the leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businesses of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, compared to the previous year's eight-place lower ranking.
The contest Absurdität des Jahres was first proclaimed in the year and takes place every year after the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of the competition at the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used to register. After that, the organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and lets the public vote on the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, or more precisely 105 senseless regulations and regulations have already been notified for this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominees of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay tolls for motorways and expressways, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a happening in which personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businesses of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, took part in the high point of the competition.
Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade, said: "Where the state throws clubs between the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to lift at least thirty sections each year, which are still unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs to undertake," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to make senseless arrangements out of the world have an effect.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report to the trade office on the site of their permanent site three days in advance the intention of going to an exhibition stand or a fair.
This obligation was abolished by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report up to 30 days of work trips to the employment office - was abolished by the Green Card Act.
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the decree imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two person scales in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement fell away.
A new category pays tribute to socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair ventures.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile communications company Vodafon, who is the announcer and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafon company of the year, companies registered, for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirational and would provide enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about people with disabilities, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera emerged, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also provides exemplary care for its disabled employees, who account for 70 percent of their workforce, for which she was awarded the title of "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, she ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, MiRyz Soft, a accounting firm, introduced a fluid working time, which was reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains its managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, in turn, is interested in the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, it also promotes home work with its employees and in company actions it uses cartering services offered by a domestic sheltered workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, to work, to increase their qualifications and to the holidays," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the Year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed with the registration and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the Pilsen ground fund building, the anti-corruption police arrested the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition currently taking place in order to resolve restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition belonged to a specific interested party.
Luboš G. is said to have paid half a million.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Procuratorate of the newspaper "Právo", who could not provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
The way in which he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated on this in the light of scarce official information.
The spokesman for the ground fund Lubomír Černá referred to Právo's question that the police had actually arrested the ground fund at the Pilsner branch and that they had arrested it during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concretized.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct name "the request to tender claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, within the scope of the invitation, a higher value of their restitution claims to be paid by the transfer than the declared property value."
"According to the rights offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, and then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesman for the fund.
Luboš G. obviously had information at his disposal about who had registered at the request and because he himself was a legitimate person, since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a real estate interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously for a fat severance.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
In the past, Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds.
He also played a role in the causa of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted because he published in replacement restitution land for which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. from the Land Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the point where the construction of the access hall to the Borské pole industrial area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give small pieces of money in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by several hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste water charges and for district heating and in some places rents will also grow.
Families will have to move several hundred crowns out of the wallet each month from January onwards.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places district heating will also be more expensive.
The cost of electricity alone is a few hundred kroner a year.
The heavy electricity prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, thus it is due to the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic plants.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, it is precisely when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred more crowns per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger places are planning price increases.
For example, since January, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kroner per month for district heating, and more than 1000 kroner per year will pay families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague face 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rent increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will be eliminated from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants to prosecute.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 homes, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whisky, which was stolen from the father's bar.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen have to be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beers or wine are completely out of fashion, because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief physician of the children's department at the Hořovice Central Bohemian Clinic.
"Whisky, if the father succeeds in stealing a bottle from the bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," the chief physician explains.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"Most often it's about Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"Sometimes it was also about Slibowitz, which you take from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are far from exceptional in hospital admission.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Paediatric Department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk pupils from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12 when she was first introduced to the blood with 3.5 promilles of alcohol and in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at some dance party at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief physician wonders.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in pushing their own offspring that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children are not concerned with real dependence in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol, along with all the associated phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokesman for the Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local Department of Child and Adolescent Medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which required hospitalization, are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are taken home by their parents after outpatient treatment or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of liquor in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes that are 100% reliable: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of grief because of the bad testimony or because of the joy of the holidays."
"On Walpurgis night, I also experienced seven drunk children in the reception at once," Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
Paradoxically, a drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only struggles with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning after, which are due to dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be dispelled in the hospital with a fluid-donating infusion with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, who sometimes spoils the patient's good mood by telling them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousand crowns.
"Once in a while, I used this as an educational tool when I directly charged the children during the visit, which cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such party," Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not use regressive procedures to claim the costs necessary to cure the drunk children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
This is the first time that this type of machinery is owned by a foreign army.
They have only been seen abroad at maneuvers or flying shows.
It is about the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
According to Jan Pejšek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, when she physically exped the planes from Vodochody is not yet known.
The single-seat fighter aircraft L-159, on the other hand, were separated from long-term stored aircraft without further deposits and investments by the Ministry's department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were replaced in current condition and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159 to a two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, and the second will take over it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to enforce the combat aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of aircraft L-159 and that they are intended to train NATO pilots.
"It is therefore up to the buyer how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not advertised a tender procedure for purchasing, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defence Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24 and wanted to sell the rest.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa airplanes should also have a court replay.
The European Commission brought the case before the European Court of Justice against the Czech Ministry of Defence. The reason? It would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of an all-European tender and not by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last one to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health problems, Ms Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which form at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones the child was exposed to in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research revealed that testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that he was aware of this study, but he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely established".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicemen were in many places on the axis all night.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This is what Novinky.CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK) said.
At km 91, a truck crashed, at km 93, two trucks collapsed, in which there were injured.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks have collapsed.
The drivers should leave right behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and drive at km 182 at the village of Kývalka.
In fact, there are miles of traffic jams.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that immediately at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a snow cover several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, motorcades form in the Prosek district, and the Štěrboholská street is completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff will meet.
There are also problems with the railway and the airfield.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven high-speed trains due to snow drifts.
For example, there are problems on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travelers should definitely find out about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m. since Wednesday.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov three side roads are completely unpassable, in the vicinity of Brno there are some snow drifts and in the vicinity of Blansko one is forced to use snow blowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snow blowers will have to be used for snow clearing.
It is not possible to estimate when they are re-passable.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be scattered with inert spreading agents for nature conservation reasons, lies a snow cover of up to five centimetres, ČTK explained.
In the Czech Republic, fresh snow fell from two to ten centimetres, mostly in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
For the first time, American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which has so far only been known under its code designation XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate gun.
Their projectiles are directed into the target by laser with a meeting safety of only a few meters.
The special bullets of calibre 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the impact of the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, they can be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audet, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact sight point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only has to pull the trigger.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and shoots the bullet to the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
Fujitsu, a Japanese company, relocates its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the district of Niederrad in Frankfurt, as the industry giant specialized in computer and maintenance announced on Wednesday.
A spokesperson for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, a further 100 jobs of the Group should be accommodated there, which so far have been distributed across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in Astro Park were better suited to the working methods of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu had been only tenants.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region caused joy yesterday among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a "global player" had been won.
That's a "great site confession."
Fujitsu passed to the city that the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed of the intention by the management early on.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
Now it's about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
Fujitsu's so far used house on the Town Hall Square and the neighbouring "Little Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects of the spa town with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new Stadtentree was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the previously partly used parking areas as well as the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens, purchased the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu cruiser is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has much more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad from Bad Homburg and the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name refers to its star-shaped layout - the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Industries, among others, has its headquarters.
Amazon Blocks Servers - Threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be in England.
The revelation platform Wikileaks is getting more and more under fire in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search lists, is said to be in Britain after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced from Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the unveiling activists announced via Twitter short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic dispatches in order to cope with the high number of accesses to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks further stated: "Excellent - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon had stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after research by Senator Joe Lieberman, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Homeland Security Senate Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called on the platform not to use servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and ruthless action is jeopardizing our national security and endangering life around the globe," said a message from the non-party senator.
"No responsible company - American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is in Britain, the exact location being known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the Wikileaks disclosure officer be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an advisor to head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
The White House and Assange were inundated by an exchange of hits.
American President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced espionage calls on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its own website."
The American government is now testing the protection of its databases.
The White House announced that the Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, had been appointed as Special Representative.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary after Wikileaks had disclosed the messages.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the security of dissidents and the most active should the Wikileaks release put them in jeopardy.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Secretary of State Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if that's necessary."
The Ice University
At Gelato University near Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the Gelataio and the Gelataio.
The gelatian, in German somewhat ancient the ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian figuremaking.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cold store with a spatula, puts it in the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, don't pass the Gelato University of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the ice cream machine manufacturer in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also several days special courses around the chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlour.
Some people dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag something her own after years in a annoying job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatians Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the icing of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems to be quite simple.
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all types of milk ice cream.
The lecturer is immediately overwhelmed with questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one let go of one's own desire to experiment?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can make ice even without a stabilizer, but then it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it will settle in, and the customer bites on all the ice grains.
Certain variations on the basic mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or from the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which turns with eggs into yellow cream and with cocoa powder to the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano makes them four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The fruit ice cream varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - this is not necessarily better taste.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream makes the working group, which uses more fruits, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Luciano says that it is only a balanced mixture that really enhances the taste of a gelato.
Ice making is a math task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano pulls out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (Winzer thus measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice doesn't require as much physical use as it used to be.
Not only the device for the automatic manufacturing of the basic material helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously creamy beaten and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns are not left out.
The Brazilian Gustavo gets himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized bar mixer gets out of control.
"In every class," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in twilight
The European Food Authority, Efsa, was infiltrated by the industry experimenting with gene crops.
The expert group Testbiotech now formulates this accusation, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
This is paid by corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper had played a significant role in the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and was thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticisms Then.
The Efsa regulations are identical in terms of terms with the position papers of the Ilsi and thus bear the signature of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech is calling for a conflict of interests.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager was recently without any conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and had thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed human relations between the controlling EU authority and industrial lobby, which the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU Parliamentarians have heard.
However, the Efsa cannot detect any conflict of interest.
All the serious data, including those of industry, should be taken back as long as they are of high technical quality, is stated in an opinion.
From the experts who work for Efsa, one does not ask that they have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised in animals without any feeding experiment and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what genetically modified maize does in the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?"Then asks accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck sees that as well.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this field, as in the US, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies would normally not be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Track of the Stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September the excavators had arrived and had begun to cancel a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't disappear."
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he sawed one up, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the chunks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all the people who attacked the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden box that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when the newspapers said in September that he had bought the remnants of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it were to happen, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to continue to be used.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80-kilometre quadruples with them, a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest is sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and dragged away what trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the impulse have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He gets into his off-road car, makes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and aborted it, later biology, then he became interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He stores 40000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he carts together his treasures.
He says he's the biggest stone dealer in the Republic.
He's slowing down.
In the snow there are artfully hewn sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Marienbrücke in Dresden," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, swarming.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
Go on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once the quads belonged to the grandstand of Stuttgart's Neckarstadion.
Stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were hand-cut and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shred something like that."
He has not become rich, certainly not at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, besides, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a garden builder settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the residual recycler.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Talent struggle for high potentials
There's a lot of crowd at the buffet.
16 students crave salmon buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automotive manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition they are supposed to talk about the car of the future together with VW developers - and by the way get to know Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperations with the universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture halls as early as possible before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the achievements of their students, they try to spot the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the car company advertises the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig oversees the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and think about who could be an employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
New is that so offensive around the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was rather on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to pay off, especially for highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger.
Roman Dykta is looking for talent for the auditing and consulting company KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt where participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company intends to send eight promising students across the USA next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
If you are allowed to join, decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger when they hit and stab the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to get out of the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Talent hunter Dykta seems to pay the bill.
"To this day, we have been in contact with all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct boom on the campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also have a classic look at professional fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa at Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, HR Manager at Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the young people's problem.
35 jobs are currently advertised on the company website.
"It's very difficult to occupy vacant positions right now."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships or write your diploma thesis with us."
Expensive promotions are not announced with the solar specialist.
For this the company tries to promote for itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large company often cannot offer this," says Staff Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the leading role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among Germany's top 100 employers in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute draws up an annual list of German employers.
To this end, it questions employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also be a plus for job seekers.
"I think that applicants are looking especially for external evaluations of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to become more authentic.
And, according to Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, the internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within the company's own workforce, is called.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for their employer with friends and acquaintances on their own.
"It's like a game with gang," says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
A ban on this has been imposed by the government in Washington - and thus definitively revokes its previous plans.
New drilling will also be prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which will apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Prior to the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the US' dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Anyone who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been conclusively resolved.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is to present its results during December.
In October, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the post-explosion drill stop.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which was in disrepute after numerous charges of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the volume of production in the Gulf would be significantly lower than previously due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey conducted by the consulting firm BDO - even before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of spilled crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't complain," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been following an attempt to expose a boy wading up to the chest in the water with the shingles surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water-gloss, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It cannot be seen that under the surface brown crude-oil sponges float.
She used to gather shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a bristled pipeline poured tons of crude oil into the vast wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers, the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water, the motor boat picks up brown broth, and those who dip their hand into the water pull out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black licorice sticks from the ground, sadly some palm trees leave their fronds hanging.
Bird swarms, as usual in wetlands, are in vain chosen: As soon as the outboarder is silent, spooky peace spreads in the former paradise, which smells like a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari, grimly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground fought for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe entered, where in the 1980s the first resistance was organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Shell company had to stop production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the Company is not allowed to return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of the triple size of Switzerland, with over 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, and the Group is in a position to remain unstable.
Every few hundred meters steel structures stand out like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christtrees" are called the heads of the boreholes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have flowed into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that hit the sea off Alaska at the wreckage of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Anyone who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be challenged about it.
While the Shell Group is responsible for sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see beaming drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell sets significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: "The rate of defects on the lines alone is many times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are naked and oil-lubricated to their necks.
Under one of the many barrels, partly connected with tubes, partly randomly scattered on the grounds, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First petrol penetrates through the pipes into the collection pot, later dripping at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel out.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres per day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The Delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cooks can still undercut the price of diesel, which is ridiculously low at just under 40 euro cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from bunkers that tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a vanishingly small portion of the temporary intermediate raw material is being illegally refined: the lion's share of organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, are being filled in tankers and ensnared on the world market.
The debate whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the movements of the population or to the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had they not destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell, in particular, had been so destroyed that only one deduction of the company could be considered: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese would turn out to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Maximum time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who come mainly from the country's north, also want - like all Nigerians - to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a big security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction failure in the investigation of an emergency landing machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than previously known: The Australian aviation security authority has identified a major security problem in its investigations with the engines of some A380 machines - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, according to an opinion of the ATSB authority published this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure."
Rolls-Royce produced engines in 20 A380 aircraft.
Below is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land on November 4th in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney to enable him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his airline would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had dissolved and the wings had damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem had been considered to be of sufficient importance to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily dropped about three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa switched off the engine on an A380 as a precaution.
The double-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Countrywide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Snow fell almost all over the country overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights fail.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the whole republic is snowed up to Thursday at night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and in the east there are partly 15 centimeters thick snow covers.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, heavy gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) is expecting storm surges with water levels of 1.2 metres above the normal level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snow drifts on motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the meteorological center Meteomedia, this is why alarm level was violet in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
Partly there fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stagnant traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic had to be stopped from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
According to a spokesperson of the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
According to a Fraport spokesman, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers were at the airport, there were still almost 400 field beds available for them.
Accidents already occurred on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here, too, a truck was caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed the road with her car at Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will stir up even with slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is plagued by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Just now, Deutsche Bank has made its headquarters attractive: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernised; meanwhile, bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial company apparently wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes on the basis of a speaker.
The reason for the planned sale was not given by the speaker.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate itself and then rent it back," he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institution will leave its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had not taken over the double towers until mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and then extensively renovated them.
According to the figures, the energy conversion swallowed around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers that have now been renamed "Greentowers" to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, said the spokesman.
Thousands grieving for dead buddies
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies still could not be recovered because the security situation in the disaster shaft is still precarious.
About two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth City.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the calamity shaft, but had found no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies haven't been recovered yet.
Now family and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners there were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies could be seen.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not complete the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are suppressed, it starts to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
To hell, warriors!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rough killing methods and pulls the intestines out of his enemies when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, doesn't say a word about the whole movie, and the other characters at most get carried away to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, it is silent and sluggish in the spookyly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the Viking world the backdrop of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineasts with interest for existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It's nice if a movie has multiple target groups, it's only a pity if they're mutually exclusive.
Since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" director Winding Refn is considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream or somewhat less brutality to the Arthouse with a little more humor.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest, when, for freely interpretable reasons, Eineye breaks up with a group of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and is stuck in fluff and fog for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" found no cinema rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-slapping facade is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a strenuous action, it's all atmosphere, a fever dream that has become a film.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly treats him to a moment of relaxation, and with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack he slowly closes his throat, but above all with the incredible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy loyal to the eye keeps something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the depraved anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate and admire, to anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
Around midnight from September 5th to September 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quadruple, hidden in a valley that runs off the electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, she showed where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was close to commissioning, they said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little more is known than then, yes, the riddles became rather larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, while the CIA was quite certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, there was little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some secret services in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "alleged reactor" even if they consider the CIA presentation "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diploma only lapidar replied in the summer that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians quickly removed the rubble of the alleged "unused military building", they thoroughly planned the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial operators from a Member State directly after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always affirmed that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analysing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as satellite images.
In addition, the inspectors are denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack.
Thus, since June 2008, the investigation of the case has been inconceivably slowed down and "increasingly develops into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, a serious violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty over which the IAEA is guarding is in the area.
The IAEA appears to see three other facilities that are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor as the key to progress in the Enlightenment, and that still exist differently from the latter.
To date, the inspectors have not disclosed which installations are concerned, what function they have, or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and identified a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - this is precisely why Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent forward by the US to spy out military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip from the US secret services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellites, that material has been transported back and forth between the three locations and the quadrilateral at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from it, there are at best plausible conjectures on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could contain valuable traces, was stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the rubble has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, which investigated Syria in 1998 for its suitability as a repository for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, images from orbit show that Syria did earthwork in the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of inspectors is.
However, Damascus also ironed this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna appeased a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter had no high urgency, for example, US ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing in so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they can't find anything in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless directorial debut in the summer, there's trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor that the woman, a Muslim, is stubbornly in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, and some shooting days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Female Victims of War wrote about the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is herself ambassador of the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, their organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her screenplay, gave Sarajevo a filming permit after a lot of back and forth - it is not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, that she has been involved in the Yugoslavian conflict with great effort, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague with the content.
A second synopsis of the film is on the net, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew themselves in it already before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds considerably different than the variant "rape victims fall in love with torture slave".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: by putting the script, like so many before, illegally on the net.
Let's get out of here.
This evening it's finally going around for the Irish again.
No sign of distress.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans are jogging with joy and loud music, they are stomping with their feet.
The Bailey pub in South Irish Cork is trembling because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, there is 500 euros win premium plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
On his plan there is no fun in Las Vegas, he will have job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a dull feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have any work there yet."
After all: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "She had a hard time, a long time ago her dream job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and his brother Colin now has a job as IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they expect to have 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is especially insecure for the young, well-trained Irish, for whom so far it has only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was plenty of money.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under thirty are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are too many letters from the readers of young emigrants complaining, "Everything is going down in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one will turn off the light, please."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future emerging, because the government is only obsessive and no longer offers the young people any prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes her fellow students hanging from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the topic of working abroad.
"For starters, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known what it feels like to build somewhere else for six months.
Because there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're moving up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely sees his home, because he makes extra shifts in order to be able to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never again."
He laughs a bit embarrassed and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent of which was financed by credit.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it might go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over again."
The civil engineer doesn't like the lamentation he hears at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel like an Irishman."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last big economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just see how life is going somewhere else.
He's been working in London for a couple of years, and why shouldn't he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that really worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might turn into a goodbye party.
"Don't be too emotional," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Farewell, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walk-away party, easy, with some friends, a few drinks, some games."
The Democatric Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of supporters of democracy has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since the sharp slump last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined its efforts to achieve more democracy.
The fact that this continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America have only experienced a short period of recession and have recovered rapidly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many people in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared with 38% last year, the figures have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economies: around 71% of respondents say that the private sector is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the greatest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
On the other hand, respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries see the most influential country in the US, with Venezuela assuming this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An Electoral Slack
No one had expected that the elections in Haiti on 28 November would be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral workers who rushed to help the battered country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes, ballots in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems.
Electoral stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless from the January earthquake, roamed around looking for a choice.
Some finally gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded that the election results be lifted due to alleged fraud.
Some violent protests took place throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as "very good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected final election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial appeal for invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support for the voters, declares the electoral authority to be the winner of the final election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organisation.
Shortly before the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
Donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
Whether you will be able to re-election next year depends on whether the grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who guided economic policy even after his wife's election, often drew up budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further discord.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money at his own discretion.
The economy is hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction its main objectives, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently improved official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to hold talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt of a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to rejoin Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister for Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the preparation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after her term of office has ended, even without her husband's support.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathies that were brought to them will be flattened.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to keep many of her husband's political decisions quiet and quiet.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching closer ties to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the Strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters, set up to elect mayors and city councillors in the five districts. This is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with China's mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only in a short time.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-turning mass parades and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempt at murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a standing spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like to prioritize its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also avoided to stir up the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It reacted to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of bringing Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, a new generation of moderated politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of the working and youth.
As a presidential candidate for the DPP, Tsai received great support, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing its utmost to show that it too is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans a forge of ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this presupposes prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that their party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's rapid approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the candidates of the DPP had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the Pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's intervention, the DPP is difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan has only limited support for a re-adjustment.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer over-the-counter was nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual, but it is in line with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at most three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with their lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose greatest success in 2003 is closest to being a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination for Spaldings.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category instrumental albums. This favourite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Competitors Iyers include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a predatory favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, which usually features albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category big group. He thus competes against the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonys No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu" was nominated by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute play is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" was nominated in the Instrumentalolo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said that he had written the 15-minute piece especially for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
Only women have been nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Exactx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five-hour, often heated public hearing, the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides, according to Press-Enterprise, being fairly evenly distributed.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," said one comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America's over."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
Its community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer for water filter systems.
The new, approx.2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style is to have two minarets and become about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that can live, among other things, from arsenic opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe that it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will be published in the online issue of Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, the scientists found that the bacterium in Mono Lake in California continues to grow even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, says Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were published gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes that are both exposed may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it smears virtually everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has not been a working example.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, so science assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life can have developed differently than in the early Earth age," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibit dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknown people stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were accommodated in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday night, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are well," Whitmore says.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide any precise information on the location of the dogs nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say anything more about this," Whitmore explains.
"We're tracking a few tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's representatives found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship, because Trace was to participate in the competition.
As Peek der Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions during the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finder's wage. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage would be paid.
The lion roars again after legal approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially approved the "preparing" Glauber plan to pay off the $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of US exchange law, so that nothing stands in the way of the reboot of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will lead the somewhat worn-out studio as chief executive.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which is itself providing $75 million, is running the company. The financing is scheduled for mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management who struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial concerns and pay out the studio's more than 140 lubbers took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything started from the beginning when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1,2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to re-record the production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio will need a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not produce any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gimmicks can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game equals about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And even though fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer in the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children aged 3 and over) are plush figures as big as guinea pigs singing a note when you press on their belly.
Once press corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchangeable games like 'Simon says', and thanks to its new hinge feet with wheel block, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children testing the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the 80s, you certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better-knower with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children aged 8 and above).The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together in words before time runs out. It's great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he can handle a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived some time in our dog's mouth.
Police Operations in China Will Be Softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - to impress the audience.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely out of the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped bows.
"For me, they look average," Mr. Tang remarked with contempt.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low-stammering: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled a misplaced snack truck and stared at the operator until he packed in after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening urban police patrols. They have been selected specifically for their looks, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the rough-handed police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese from these city commandos have.
That's right, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officers in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death while filming a protest action against a garbage dump with his cell phone.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a handcuff with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street traffickers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the China Daily national newspaper lamented last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing".
Sceptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits per ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as visual distractions.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were searched for with a good figure and "harmonious features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physically strenuous.
"The most important thing is their image," said an unnamed district official on the virtually government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's municipal administration, does not wish to agree to this description:
But admitted that in China size specifications in job advertisements are not unusual for both sexes.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical distortions do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lame people or hunchbacks here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple packets and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn't feel sexist enough to put so much emphasis on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the city's image."
According to them, they do not regret the short attitude, since they have more ambitious career plans than simply pushing traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street traders who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you so many times already!" explains Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen, which was fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in the leisure sector.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchants' goods, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, ransacked after the rumor that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the nocturnal incident, 14 government vehicles were knocked over or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired in contravention of the regulations on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol, stayed behind, turning his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time, people start the fight."
Prosecutor won't charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations made against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to lobby her husband, the Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal that caused headlines nationwide and dampened his career, he was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
Senator Ensign's office announced that he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were closed and that there were no further charges on this matter.
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails, and other documents that were first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped create lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during Ensign's campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton's work done. According to the records and interrogations, he took over Hampton's lobbying work for them.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby for a year for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on revolving-door lobbyism.
According to the evidence published, "it seems to be an agreement and a violation of the revolving door statute," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defense of clients targeted by the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the ministry seemed very cautious in taking political charges after a large number of defeats, which were persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrifying," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US parliament and government), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to justice.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day that he was told that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much is said: we think we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to close the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, according to which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had violated the Federal Electoral Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton's company moved on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "anklopfe" at the Home Office for a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also scheduled for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after this had stopped Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair came to the public for the first time, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in fourth place in Republican ranking.
After he hadn't noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes that the Ethics Committee will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stop his investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire Appeals Raise Attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tapped away in the riots in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent their reports of gruesome witness testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence issued by the jury falls.
However, Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications with the court, explaining the reasons for an appeal, and who will employ the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - led to a "circular atmosphere" and so widespread, prompt penetration of rebellious details, so that the jury had been unduly influenced by public indignation.
This opposition could prompt the appellation courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"Just as I experienced it during this trial, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the Chamber, rejected the requests by decision in a short and concise manner last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States abrogated the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who was said to have killed his wife, and in his decision said that there had been a "carneval atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court appeals that consider Mr. Haye's conviction half a century later may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to settle the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in trials being pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' attorneys present to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have been preconceived when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their suitors, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say that they also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution and argue that the judge mistakenly exchanged a judge who was a critic of the prosecutor's office and that he had improperly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of extensive reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of Governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions over the case.
"One such daily rush of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more up-to-date than reports that are being reported more slowly is an anti-tech look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said that appellation courts are often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes need to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers amplify this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which abrogated Dr. Sheppard's conviction on the basis of reporting, and made it clear that the new media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign of abusive words and negativity, little courtesy broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not bring a breakthrough on the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a term of government in which no decisions were made.
After all you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial score-gathering.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that masks the ideological gap that continues to separate members from each other.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one calls for the other sign of cooperation and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting itself on Tuesday and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election voted at least mildly for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partial passions that are dying again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts are for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Insituation warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of lame duck session does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - which leads courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as a preliminaries, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
No matter how worried the Republican leaders may be that they are poking too high, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and put an end to health reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and raising some taxes as well as raising the retirement age and lowering public spending.
Vice-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have urged so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling hard to get even closer to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases of the White House and Republican struggle in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republican Obama challenges the state budget, taxes, and health system, followed later by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanism and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a foreplay for a far more far-reaching election in consequence.
From this point of view, the courtesy that is being displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that still divide them.
Sucked-out US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "cleptocracy" and it passes on some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, they say.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "the verticale of authority" - takes its part of the money that the leaders move up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that it would have been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have for years rejected allegations of corruption, and he has won numerous accusations of slander against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. That's what polls have revealed.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individual persons are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Inspectorate (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov's top priority."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on stage two."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city offers no help."
The report continues that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and arrests the police for small businessmen.
A source, it is said, "declared that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (and not from organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, criminal gang protection is no longer as much in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that, while collecting funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will not be very modest; even those who pay will sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time he has noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy's memo contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Byse, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Countrywide, estimates By, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and leafing walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that for the first time tells the story of Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodian community tribunal condemned for the first time a former member of Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former chief of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, remediation or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government fell in 1979, the remnants of the regime and his military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the UN in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died naturally in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elitist officials of Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts for laying down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng,
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Rhemer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also awakened worries here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The task of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate Anlong Veng's fears.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told officers from Cambodia's Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers were believed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Kamboja lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Kamboja must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything."
The centre created the first government approved textbook on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the History Book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often happens in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a path, overgrown by shrubs and covered with plastic waste, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the street, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay down a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to continue to accumulate weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
However, US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's April "47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit" that excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons capable, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko back then.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make any dirty bombs out of it and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, say Officials.
It was loaded into a special train that has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say Official.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for this effort, with most of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Transmitting Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the USA have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners via Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as indicated by a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This reflects the documents enveloped by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable). It is added that former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, was indicted, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the report of the Council "had met Zapatero on the sidelines" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed", so as not to be "unprepared to be surprised", Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish Government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since it is in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, told the embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of documents from the Spanish Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense via CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage governments discreetly," Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are extremely concerned about their independence and do what they consider appropriate", he had given his staff instructions that "inflated rhetorical comments should be avoided in order to ease the tension."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to the matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government of Zapatero's actions of the US, which could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, will be tolerated or deliberately ignored, will be capitalizing, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he points out.

Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she leads from a young age, she keeps contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
In order to understand this, one must know her love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies of her family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
She held for a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, she became aware that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-husband never let him do a DNA analysis.
Soon after, she started a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of her news, it can be concluded that her love affair broke up and they broke up.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to be able to do and leave what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message that she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address that I can send the boy to."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th because I have to imagine a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that if everything goes well, she'll take her firstborn with her.
"He will be with the one he must be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with someone else except my mother", a dubious intention, if one considers their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
The 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A big kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. See, if he wants to, he'll find me, shit like that."
On the 30th one more: "The boy is fine. He goes into a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now closed, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison discharger."
"Terror a la gallega (headline)".
The last man to live with her, a sworn hunting overseer, declares to have remorse for feeling guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she hadn't told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to the provincial prison in Palma yesterday from the center for prisoners of justice to Menorca.
The defender of duty, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the course of events, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in the number of votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - ahead or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as that of the Catalonian elections.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising tendency - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote share and the attachment of the electorate of the PP - persists, the analysts of the PP predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congressional MPs in the parliamentary elections, while CiU four (it now has 10) will gain and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one Member - currently it has three - while IPV could hold its Member or win one.
However, should the electoral calendar be maintained, the next date for the municipal elections will be May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scales to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with their majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city's largest budgets: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists cannot achieve a majority or rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable for this party to lose its representation on the Barcelona municipal council, in which it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona's revival, where they had ruled together with the PP in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party also recorded a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven police officers from the Barcelona police station arrested Pakistanis and Nigerians formed the Thai-controlled jihadist cell, which provided passports to various Al Qaida groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter author of the attacks in Bombay, which claimed 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far that he assures that the "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaida's forgery worldwide and "so with their ability to act".
The researchers assume that during the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that made up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The revealed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, apart from the Thai investigation bodies, other European police units have been involved in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that similar attacks will occur in the area of the EU in the next few days as the one carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, during which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
From Bangkok, they had headed the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - stole in particular tourist passports according to the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents must be on the names of men aged 25 to 45 years and have to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In research circles it is underlined that up to now no connections have been established between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company, which had been "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present to Artur Mas in person their terms of support for his taking up office as Prime Minister of Generalitat, which are not different from those already presented during the election campaign and can be summed up by the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial settlement agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party turned with certainty to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist CiU party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining in the vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible duck with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As far as the party leaders of the PPC are concerned, they demand that "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial reconciliation between the state and the autonomous region - similar to that in the Basque country - and which the head of CiU even wants to subject to a referendum be made in the back.
Both political leaders are in agreement that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for the entry into office of Mas are discussed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalana).
The Senior Care Centre confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The officials in charge of La Caritat's nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they pointed out the damage caused by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - to the institution.
Joan Sala, head of the nursing home for the elderly, appeared in court with his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social standing, because it had not established the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but must now also pay a large amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he had continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were carried out by telephone due to their age and diseases.
La Caritat's head denied this point and stated that "a lack of action could not have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no evidence in the lawsuit for negligent acts of any person other than the accused."
The one who had already been baptized as a "death angel" confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that he had committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
La Caritat's head said that it was difficult to control staff's access to the drugs.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had done according to confession in three women whom he murdered between October 12th and 17th.
In La Caritat, they don't believe the nurse's statements, not even as far as the number of confessed murders is concerned, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made it available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats to the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
The risk premiums of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and that the euro has barely increased in points, which causes concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market which recovers to the extent that it collapses, but due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB must withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase sovereign debt, as it was ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly calls for tender with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the bond purchase program will continue and send a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if we are stubbornly insisting that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, at which the Bank confirmed that it would not consider buying government debt securities and that markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, which provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
State wealth management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of markets, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the debt gap figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognise the problem of stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government must obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her discourse towards the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish President of the Government yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi's Four Seasons in the ears of investors.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we rely on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debt rescheduling capacity.
For Spain, applying for a help plan would be self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now it is not only the being that counts, but also the appearance."
Courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Management of Oulen is appealing to the shareholders' meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not subside.
David Álvarez, founder of the company gurppe, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding does not seem to be willing to give in to his dispute over the control of El Enebro's organs.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register, appointed members of the Board of Directors.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the commercial court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunderbolt in the lap of the Álvarez family.
Invoking the judge to arrange the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the annulled assembly of 18 January recognized by means of legal scourge, fraudulent machinations and abuse of rights", as official speakers state.
This argumentation is the basis for the challenge of the assembly in retrospect, in order to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, enveloping themselves in discreet silence, tried in June unsuccessfully to convene a meeting on the judicial path.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
That is the real background to the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to deal with the appeal for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history has been marked by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
At the beginning, nobody paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, everyone in the final sprint last November was betting on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This computer science program called PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that using this software in the Red Bull Formula 1 factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm states that in 1992 on average ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull's team. They carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing car with powerful computer systems.
Siemens Manager explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on its race in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the service of his participation on the race tracks are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is zero.
Steve Nevey, head of technology at the plant, points out that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the field of R&E contributed 50 percent to the victory for racing cars and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, share values have changed, with the technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they "are not predictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years' time
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of twenty sales networks, each with 80 to 100 square metres, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company has agreed to this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the rebuilt shop at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming reopenings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The deputy chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the store is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to "optimize customer service and advice to small and micro enterprises in purchasing and after that, even packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as for private customers, because large companies already have their technical after-sales service contracts," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from his rivals in three years
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a fall in the interest rate margins which banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - an outstanding specialist.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without recourse to the FROB public aid, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700,000 if you withdraw the customers who will lose the bank - which is the great challenge facing this bank, because up to now it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Private customers have a market share of 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. It will present the challenges faced by the bank together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has upset all the banks' plans around the world.
Sabadell will conclude its Optima four years ago, initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain is only "slowly" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which punishes the interest margins - will subside, the risk increases that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their issuances in order to maintain liquidity will already be passed on to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't spin the rooster, but the interest differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto issued an order to its branch network to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the stategy to "increase fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"Everything will change in the coming year," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "enormously increasing" and did not rule out some Spanish financial institutions slipping into red figures.
He felt that FROB could replace the money market in capitulations.
After asserting that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument of some bankers who already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be circulated, but in contrast to the events in June, short-term financing via repos could be achieved and thus the crisis could be resolved.
CECA excludes a second wave of savings banks
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a wave of mergers between the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector would be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on participating in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, José Antonio Olavarrieta, Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but rather as an adjustment."
"Most of it is completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process, which was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he pointed out.
Olavarrieta explained that "there were a number of inappropriate opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed unsatisfaction and nonsense," because "Banco de España urges us to close before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "maybe" in the whole world and added that those who doubted this would do so "without any deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that, in the current economic situation, we need to "do not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests that the ECB conducted in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to retain the euro, but at the same time has established conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of temporary work companies or the abolition of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 per cent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of most of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the German Mark - although this sounds more like science fiction at the moment - supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that exceed the targets; possibly the cessation of payments of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission provided incentives for deficits, and the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent this from happening from 2016.
This was the first sign of the drift between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was set by the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out once again with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable the rescue of a country while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was conceived as anti-European, as it advanced the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, albeit somewhat sweet, has been adopted, and over the next few months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It says to everyone that - even if unpopular measures now have to be taken - the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which the opposing countries will be severely punished, forced to declare insolvent and, in this case, the private sector will have to cover some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must take a hard course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as Spain has pointed out in booming times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It's not just about driving the government deficit down to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is betray ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has prepared her way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Among the possibilities considered, the fact that we would have to leave the euro area full of less serious countries is not to be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sport and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to avoid a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed about whether it was an unportable act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty for the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without any cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules followed in this sport.
Part of the debate surrounding the case is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who, in his anthem, pretended nobleness and honor and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, who added one episode more to his long story than theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a rule change. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage to the sport spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposing players take unjustified advantage of the counter team. Nor did that happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by false play or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible in order to be punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders drew from the deliberate fouls.
It should be stressed here that the rival was neither placed in a more unfavourable position nor benefited from the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that his own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually also retire. In addition, the players get a sanction with this approach and pass into the second cycle of cards, in which they do less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
This does not make it so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which includes strategic decisions in order to derive the greatest possible benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid a sanction (this would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they rather wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision to evade or flee without a penalty.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that polemics arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked transmission of rules.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer to catch customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread. They don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas Lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season that bring oxygen to Barcelona's catering and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which is the big crowd: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two top day (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, lowest prices are demanded, confirmed Gaietà Farràs, Chairman of the Barcelona Restaurant Board.
The representative of the umbrella association dares not yet predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it a dozen times before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers will save in times of crisis, which is why prices will be the most demanded by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants it turns out that the evening of 17 December leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras group says that the requests for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros will be booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, you don't lose your optimism after the second quarter of the year's revenue has blossomed again and good prospects for the Christmas business, albeit concentrated on a few days.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added as a price hit. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
Green sprouts are also seen in some companies, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back in the upswing.
From the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice-chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are overall quite "lively", although the customers "put out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating has not decreased, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme raises major concerns in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Revelations by Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the margins of the clarifying and succulent details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries is not strengthened in terms of nuclear security, but on the contrary "takes off" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhytmus than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but that their items are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - Washington prepare sleepless nights.
Anne W. Patterson, Ambassador to Pakistan, listed the following risks in a report prior to the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the suspected dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenal and missile programs is no longer seen as excessive by the US, but also by Russia, and the reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan must hire strictly devout personnel to guard nuclear facilities; due to low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is slowing down, and the increased rate of Pakistan producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," declared: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit to the Chief of Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" to the person responsible that "Pakistan's army has to cease its tacit support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high leader in the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning to track down and locate Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can only be explained in a difficult way.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to find and persecute Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures "the police where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authority, based in Lyon (France), issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities received the authority.
The 188 Interpol countries are in need of identifying and finding Assange, "to arrest and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states, according to the organization, consider the red warning as a free letter for a detention - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be present.
The action outraged Assange's lawyers who issued a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also remind us that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and was granted permission by the prosecutor, who was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is accused in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia asserts her son's innocence - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indeterminate location. During the interview, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high leader in the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to pay less attention to Assange contrasts with the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators have expressed these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chairing the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and persecute anyone who supports them or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further and had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was that leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason, and all that is not execution is too mild punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret vote on its continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the umpteenth time an internal uproar in the ranks of the ERC without direction after the loss of 11 deputies and half of the vote.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the close of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries with a wink to win the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
Yesterday, for starters, it announced that the more than 200 ERC regional councillors could make a secret statement about his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with a high hand.
If the Carodists wanted to give the President a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he affirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without stating percentages that a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod-affiliated call for the president to have more than just the party to give his office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to push for resignations, they will agree with the board on a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be submitted to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to move the congress forward in the autumn of 2011, which the party leader already considers to be a fact.
The party leader of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the current Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the principle of general assembly as a function.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should enable the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
From the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, who already fought for it at the last two congresses, is as obsessed.
In fact, at the ebbing assembly of 2008, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle's internal rest in recent years was not advisable to tackle this matter.
Now, without the critical sector lurking, the time may have come to take up this matter again and to close it forever.
23 murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the census of MILENIO, four cases were recorded in México less than 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to the censuses of MILENIO México, four fewer than in the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputees in the valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, we have a total of 390 deaths, which are probably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a place in Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearms-induced bullets, the mercy shot was fired to his head and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, a person's body was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas Street in the settlement of Santa Cruz Acatlán in the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, in the early morning, farm workers found a body with traces of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a message probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later, a 50-year-old man with eight shots was murdered after leaving his house to do his work as a garbage driver.
On November 7th, two 30-year-olds died in the village of San Pedro Xaloxtoc in the village of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, a man's body was found with the grace shot in his forehead on a lonely path in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a shell sleeve shot down with a firearm of the caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the wastewater channel of Playa Golondrina.
The emergency service looked for the rest of the body parts, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán informed of the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Peña Colorada. The hands were tied to the back and the head was connected.
The man had a wound that came from the shot of a firearm in his neck.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men was reported, wrapped in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda of the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two death threats were also found.
One day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the village of Valle de los Reyes in Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women, wrapped in blankets, were discovered in the Zoquiapan settlement of the community of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the body of a man, wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, was probably called Mario Ríos, according to the news that his murderers left beside him.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, a woman's lifeless body was found with firearms in her neck.
On the woman's skin tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding pictures were discovered.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the community of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies were discovered by two men whose heads were covered with tape and a message in the parish of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was probably a message signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet were found with traces of torture inside a taxi parked behind the San Agustín settlement's judicial centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón settlement and tied into black plastic bags, and there was a message next to it. The second had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Juárez settlement.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China's representative said at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China's offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, says Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured us that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He said that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he explained that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
He said that progress had been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the objectives of reducing emissions of gases.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the federal authorities had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the targets for energy saving, an effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
He also stated that some multiannual plans have already been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced in the last five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and private hands.
There is also a project at provincial level on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs by energy-saving bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than usual.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years and another is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist leader of the party had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what would be his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former leader of the PAN party had the right to appeal to the National Commission of Orders and to demand what the right would be.
In an interview that took place before Gabino Cué Monteagudo's appeal as governor of the state, he stated that Espino's exclusion was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"In his case, Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairperson or chairperson that Acción Nacional would need for the next three years, so he would transfer the stafette "to the one that the Council would decide."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to assign the office of party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's upswing in the recent July 4 elections would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in it and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón over his discourse in the context of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them if they should finally get out of the closet," he affirmed.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government is able to make expressions such as those in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no ban on speaking and even less censorship.
Obama supports the law in favour of undocumented students in Twitter
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief report contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to contact their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all vote for any law except the extension of tax reductions from the Bush era and the financing of the government would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs said that he trusts that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable for the other projects can be drawn up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students, could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the law of the American Dream would legalize about 800,000 young people immigrating to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, living in that country for the last five years and enrolled at a higher educational institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project organize an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most sought-after Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who spoke out for the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk in which the participants made a strong contribution to the story.
"I understand about the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (on another event the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentinean writer spat sweetly at the audience, which consisted mainly of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table hosted by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells the story first and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get an answer, but gets hints for the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Perseverance is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst hides the secret: "The wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps are mixing.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called 'lob of invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turnaround and told of America, the great novel that had not been lacking his own chronicler from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories depicted as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the sense of shame."
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best", and that is where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows to which side the narrative belongs, where fictitious literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL's invitation to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman devoted her contribution to the great wound of the social violence affecting her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggle for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unplanned commitment," she explained after emphasizing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers, as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the dedicated writer in the writer's wound".
He noticed that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also go out on dogmatisms, and is forgotten that "there is a small no behind every affirmation and a small yes behind every denial."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: and nuances often mean putting your finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when thinking in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final, there are also two different styles, defined by their respective coaches, and their encounter, marked by contrasts, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has advanced to the second champion with the medal, he is one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played with the same team consecutive finals.
The satanist strategist achieved the first final match as a coach at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he got a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at 'Clausura 2003' he achieved the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a setback again, because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros was undecided after 210 minutes of play, but at the penalty meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to take his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell in order to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, for my affection that I give myself up to, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when he was asked about the lost finals.
The last final game has remained in his memory, he assures us that he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared to retire with two penalty meters, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is over, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shooting doesn't bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shooting, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us for a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce effort to hold the title, that left us something for this final game, and we hope that it won't happen this time."
It is in Romanso's power not to be just second champion anymore and to taste the fame that the titles bring with them for the first time.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves to the visa application service points before talking to the consulate, thus reducing the costs of waiting.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change at the United States Embassy and Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before talking to the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the Consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the return to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to imagine at the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment in the consulate will be left with less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo do not have to pay the service surcharge of 26 dollars.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aerospace Agency (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a thought-provoking find for the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments, which were previously considered uninhabitable. The hypothesis was raised that they could turn into intelligent living beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for all conceivable life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances are that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that is different from what we know."
Tomorrow, Thursday, the Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its discovery at the press conference.
The conference is attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies titanium (the largest moon of Saturn) with the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, had already established himself as an independent. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Prior to the start of the introductory session in the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo weathered against the reform of the organ law, thereby excluding them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau headed by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political edge with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from their political will, and if they didn't, they would be subjugated by both parties, thereby putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"So far I (the opposition coalition) have come, that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there was agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralistic group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should reign in Congress."
"For starters, this group starts with five members and they talk to other colleagues so they can become more," said the Convergence member.
In allusion to PAN and PRI, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT pointed out that the Congress had at the moment turned into a 'juice' for two.
"Before that, it was just a party, now they split it up together."
Patrón Montalvo requested that Members be respected and given their place at the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left out on the basis of top decisions five, which will probably be nine Members. The five, which are currently seen as being divided into different political groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed upon by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
Mazatlán City Council pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city council.
The sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued on an amount of 200,144,56 Peso with the number 9258447 on the last 16 November with the purpose of "accounting open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent forward that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sold at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to it and, as a result, the number of cheques that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debt is paid, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, two of October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and this last of November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is called into question by ASE in order to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published the audit of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it became known that from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had already paid more than 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourist industry asked the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas in poor condition and to give a bad picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that, on different occasions, it was called upon to care for the destination and to transform the poor conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and walkways had had a negative effect, as the tourists came to stroll and saw the disorder, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work slowly and planlessly in this way."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance by the city.
"The community has to assume its responsibility and avoid something like that happening again. How does it do it? Well, through preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, but we residents too have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to maintain the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkept and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Nowadays, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in motion," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving Mazatlán's tourist sites, because they were not used properly and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that had to be brought to the fore together with the city. To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Luckily Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which must first be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory that we use to promote this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatlán's business sector calls for a dignified parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to be committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the Business Coordination Council CCE, proposed that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members of Parliament will exercise their right to act freely from the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival committees of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to allocate the necessary status in the state budget to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second least resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Holy King to be sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
Parents will find it difficult to fulfill these wishes the next day of the Three Kings, because the household is no more than twelve persons and one goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes tough times are called for because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go out to the streets with the brats to sell," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothes in size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd love to have this monster,' but I answered him, 'let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana sadly remembered.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the 10-year-old Isaías has the size 10, while the 8-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the lobby of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis, around ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, which are said to have served primarily in the production of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were considered to be the main conductor of the drug ring from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons were reported to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke Judiciary building hours after their arrest.
They could be accused, among other things, of accusing the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation which took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrien Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police Department, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be pursued
The draft law of the Conservatives, which according to the government is to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is likely to be stamped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I hold with a party that has put shackles on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, before the assembled deputies at the end of the weekly Caucus meeting.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person identified as a seagoing vessel for the transport of illegal immigrants to hold for up to a year, was violating the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the draft law as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
Criticism about Olivia Chow's immigration question, NDP, has turned the critics off their hands, demanding that their party not stand firm enough against the clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to achieve by mediation of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
Therefore, we do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year," said Chow.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the Canadians' will.
"The Canadians strongly inform the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that treat the country as a foot-and-mouth."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative has told the agency QMI that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Chalest of the possible creation of a new, standing unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that, despite Robert Dutil's presence, this measure was not at all discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Department on 29 October last year.
Nor was it missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement as a "conjured-out rabbit" in terms of public safety, as well as a "ready-made solution at the end of a table".
In turn, Minister Dutil had addressed those who feared that political power had too much influence on the future unity in question.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he contented to affirm.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public poll.
"The more Mr. Chalest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means of forming a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Chalest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at ENA (State University for the Training of Senior Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes to Quebec that a special mandate be given to financial audit to enable it to carry out investigations into corruption and secret arrangements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec audit could give the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow them to commit people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Chalest government.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal law in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, was currently discussing certain amendments to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism as a result.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several river courses remain under strict guard due to the high rainfall that has erupted in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road has sunk in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains from 40 to 70 millilitres of precipitation have spilled over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 further millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
There were a total of up to 100 millimetres of rain showers.
Since the snow melt that has already accumulated in certain sub-areas is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued by the Quebec Security Service regarding the flood alarms concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière become here an object of flood surveillance and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an alternate bridge was torn away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, crossing certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Security continues to be on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec state flood centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reproved
The Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians as well as for his outmoded speech on radio.
The CCNR believes that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their views, certain statements "included insufficient information about the social welfare and unwarranted negative representations of Haitians, as well as such rude speech that is not appropriate for broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed as a result of a complaint lodged by the "Front commune des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should rather provide sound rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the questionable consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" had raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not blamed for his person.
The last issue concerned the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective dispute that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he had not donated in favour of Haiti's aid, since one would not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive in character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative presentation of the Haitians.
"I've already lost my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the distribution of an unceasing expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM had acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, had to communicate his decisions once during the main broadcast time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal's Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thai boxing, now rises to the Tatami and in the boxing rings of the world in the search for new challenges.
"I started martial arts like Kung-Fu and Kickboxen in Algeria 12 years ago," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among professionals.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, he had given bad news to his rivals, both working as a security officer and employed by UPS, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between October 23 and 30.
"I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"At the moment, I am preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"There were those fighters from each category who had placed among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I took bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 I became eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in China, while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, in which punches and kicks as well as ground throws are allowed.
The fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter from this type of martial arts is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal only retained one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here in the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most prestigious in China," said the sympathetic Pfundskerl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category stand up to crown a single champion, the King of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant USD 450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over to the private sector its responsibility to this important hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won the lucrative contract without any public tender.
For Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of competitive distortion and increases prices.
"This is a new way of playing a mapped game and disenchanting the competition."
"This means that instead of playing played games, instead of playing them in secret, they are now in open form," said Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public's interest can be served in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau reacted in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this agreement was a demarcated game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she begged, encouraging that the PQ was "unrighteous" and "missing it in hardness."
She said it was "be the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium's model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scale of work.
The construction process is under way and is expected to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being able to take place; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflying of the Quebec Business Register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of it, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour force dynamic and that since the 1970s Hydro-Québec has paid special attention to this fact".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made a mistake about the fact that the project management contract has been approved by agreement.
"If you make an invitation to tender and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will go up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell you that you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the people's expertise," Laporte affirmed.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts approved by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had contracted 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had mentioned that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that "financed it" before she specified that it was rather their managers.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green, but undeniably skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players in sustainable growth, but neither is it in the mark-marked brands or eco-labels that are supposed to control his choice.
Too bad, though it bathes in a media-effective universe, where it is teeming with information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that is identified as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading, which was held yesterday, showed.
Although they advanced the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of the population of Quebec admits that, in fact, they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as they do in green business advertising, so the measuring instrument, which is sophisticated by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke, reveals.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates added to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently being stimulated by nearly one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious character of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the Quebecers are suspicious of the declared efficiency of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and had mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from traders in their neighbourhood and encouraged the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and ecological awareness seems to stop at his car, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport in 2010 or preferred the ride centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return it to its actual cinematic function, do not seem to receive what they requested.
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower level than the initially hoped-for amount, which could create an viable solution on favorable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources decapitated from the state rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the petition has been corrected downwards since the resuming.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he had sent her a final report.
However, the cabinet's counterproposal was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec ownership community of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance to provide there for real estate projects that he had not also given to other cinemas.
By contrast, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic assistance.
Cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulties after the self-financed construction of the cinema, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele at the bar.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle company, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are in turn heading for a privately financed campagne, which they hope will generate a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not dismiss the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals they have made.
Secret of the Complex Shaken Canada Revealed
The new American diplomatic leaderships spread through WikiLeaks reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the superiority of the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind at the ballot, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were published yesterday, offer even more pungent details than the mere substantial content on which to nibble.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"The Canadians' almost inherent inferiority complex may cause Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday internal issues much more than to shift black Peter to the United States in this election (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade), " he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The ambassador understands this "ear-deaf silence" all the less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in the sense of the ballot."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the message sent by Terry Breese, the Executive Director of Ottawa, on 22 January 2009, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the government's continued confidence in the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has arisen from a revival program of between $30 and $40 billion," says Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another message, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the ever-negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also abductions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by the CIA's muscle spree.
Another communication detailed how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual "case to case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed over a paper to the State Secretary in Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to look through the file again."
Finally, let us note that the minds of the WikiLeaks website are heating up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered."
He had lectured here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday, in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (CFCs), which corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented in order to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations of industrialised countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs released to earth due to lighting if the white-hot bulbs, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still by LEDs.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, large emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From this balance, however, it would be necessary to deduct 5 Gt in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white glowing pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced again by two times.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has launched this week - this company, by the way, has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, which suggests the savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that ese completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves, because they contain mercury and that they therefore have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers provide an acceptance point.
According to the report, however, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-burning pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report sets out in detail the profits each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press spokesman of the UN chief.
"It invites all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results have been announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had let the deadline set at Wednesday at midnight pass three days after the Sunday election without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from all over the world have been made. Let the CEI finally announce the name of the winner of the second round under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp anticipates the cancellation of "deceptive" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the actions brought by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more of a view that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies affirm that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results, knowing that he had lost; and that a complaint was illegal before the Constitutional Court after the election commission had been prevented from publishing the results.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was considered to be the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country divided into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of the election on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments to 9.7%), according to the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were operational or not every two weeks, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points in three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, saw a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of those over 50 years old, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only 25-49-year-olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), was prosecuted and sent to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of social assets, embezzlement of general property, hesitancy, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to address all the questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him instead of spreading fantasies."
"It's easy to insinuate him with a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first member of the PS (Party Socialiste) in the department, had attached importance to providing the judge with a memoradum for his justification by means of his lawyers before his hearing.
A member of Guérini's family, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than keep his landfill he had to run.
He would never have known about the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, said Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Metropolitan Area, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but was then released under judicial supervision from the protagonists of these acts.
"My client could provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more were charged and released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to deputy prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) disposal company, is being prosecuted because of "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials from the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one of whom was due to the title of "interference and embezzlement of general property by a public officer", the other due to "co-inflictment of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "indictment and embezzlement of social assets".
Among the people facing Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public-sector activities that had affected Corsica.
The suspects suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste management sector, will be conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
It appears from close sources that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the award and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mid-point for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage," held the French public in mind, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration in relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received from WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advices on how to deal with their own crisis of "hospitalization" in Iran (a small group of wanderers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary for the trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they shed light on the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the Way of Dealing with Hostilities".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, talked with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything they could to repatriate their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without ceasing" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocentity", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do this."
Because "silence solves nothing", passing the attempts to discuss on inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common Iranian tactic": " Seizure for the purpose of political blackmail."
He announced that Clotilde Reiss would be released from prison (which would be held on August 16th, the day she fled to the French embassy) "request a large sum of money to be paid to the Iranians" (230,000 euros in bail).
And he says that Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that will "grow worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still detained in Iran.
Information has been circulated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge's decision in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which is following the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program.
Has France accepted a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French woman ?
On the occasion of a new meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rise up against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidium and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant picks up a phone number, sets up again, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranians "are currently in the buildings in Paris run by the Iranian Embassy."
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influenced midwayer" role by means of statements and media-organised "try of escape".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is so much "thank you" to Mr. Assad based on, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to forfeit this fiction.
He analyses the intensive communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria".
A policy launched in 2008 that was then perceived "by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"Breaking up the Syrian role" Paris tries to show Syria what commendation can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians did anything."
"But despite everything, we thanked them."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our fellow countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella", which will forbid young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, as indicated by government officials.
A bill calling on online game operators to deny young people under the age of 16 after midnight access to these games will be presented to Parliament in December, describing representatives of ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Ministerial Officer of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games are then accessible again from 6 a.m.
The producer companies would have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to lower the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents are asking for it, the responsible person added.
He would also provide free programmes to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals against 58 other nations in the World Cyber Games.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
On Thursday, the Executive Committee of FIFA, in a stir due to suspicions of corruption, appoints the World Cup organizers in 2018 and 2022, a highly political election in which the shunting of influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Katar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
The machinations behind the scenes thus threaten to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) file offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the chances for its own country, the cradle of football, which was only once allowed to hold the World Cup, namely 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had once again raised the ground for this by broadcasting a documentary report that fires three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who had conducted intensive lobbying primarily with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the move, which had been successful by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to revalue the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repression against the English as well as the doubts about Solvency of Spain and Portugal increase Russia's chances, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the unrelenting incitement of the British press's accusations of "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the committee.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin bet.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, home of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA's eagerly awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will put the Asian opportunities to an end in 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all registers with the expectation of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time difference) acquired by European countries, the delicate nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
De Gaulle had really been slashing.
Mitterand had made me think he was stinging.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery that adheres to the presidency function is not well-to-see.
So you have to pretend that there's doubt from now on.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15th, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone that he would make his decision "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP Parliamentarians he would raise the perspective of "two mandates" had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely pointed out that the 2008 amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to just two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have at worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after."
His words of the day before make him no more a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they produce comments, then for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS admonish more at an early stage than assumed to be combatant.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express poll).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," responded immediately and cautiously the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," Alain Juppé corrects, who has come to terms with the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB's Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be concluded at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt is a commitment that the central bank in Frankfurt cannot afford to delay the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, so as not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
French finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in solving Europe's budgetary debt at a press conference yesterday.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the Central Bank can do more, for example by stimulating its government bond purchases programme.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the day before in Brussels at his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, had not been very eloquent about his plans, but rather content to point out that the programme of purchases of government papers on the secondary market would "continue" and that at the meeting on Thursday we will "see what the decisions are".
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled the bond purchases of the Treasury last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, it was reported to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
Since May 2010, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases totalling EUR 67 billion.
There is no doubt among traders that there will be a continuation of the purchase price (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable change in course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will continue to make generous use of the unrestricted reserves of funds over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already looking forward to this measure being extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in an essential way".
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bonds that will revive the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must replace the lack of investors on the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent premature enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest countries," said an important bond holder yesterday.
After all, if interest rates were to fly upwards, the states would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or even stabilising it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government is going to cover Italy
After a worrying beginning of the week for Italy, yesterday's situation eased a little with the fall in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional president Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indeterminate" and had expected him to have an "unforeseeable" weekend, which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, however, the German interest rate gap had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "difficultly concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain terms, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated dwindling tax receipts, which threaten the state to no longer be able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the Senate budget is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the riot over a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2 % of GDP in 2011, A.D.), requires less progress in stabilising than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, Chief Economist of the OECD.
The question remains of political inconsistency.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, which would enable the early elections to be organised at the end of March.
So there is a little favorable period ahead for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it quite clear at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think it was proved on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans are clearly holding together, ready and committed to defend their currency and their area".
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday at the interest rate feet of the European state bonds was water on the mills of the governments and the ECB.
However, there is no mention of the beginning of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt record, probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which weighs particularly on the banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "political time is much slower than markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gulf and the danger in it, are intensifying the discussions aimed at strengthening the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
And this also applies to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the lot of unconventional measures to back up the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU stability funds are concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The EU Stability Fund's first waste paper expenditure is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the agency Reuters had entrusted the United States with supporting a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the IMF's additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that should be added to the austerity measures, but which should have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
Both the one and the other are to be avoided at all costs by asking for international assistance before they have set up their own budget correlations and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back to trust in the long term.
The European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billions of euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to go back into its own pockets.
The economists of Barclays Capital, who are the main players in the European public debt market, say that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An Advisory Council which has every chance to be closely examined in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are increasing.
Snow and ice cream: 24 departments in Orange alert
The snow episodes still cause transport difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks in Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alert stage orange due to the imminent risk of snow and freezing ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in alert stage Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments snow blankets of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic obstructions and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in emergency situations, and the use of some TER coaches has been eliminated throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires drivers to take maximum care on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) invited airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris' Roissy airport and 10% of the flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAP recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in southern London and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
It is worth recalling in particular the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital increase of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum which would enable the SGP to lend a part of the financial sum to the markets twice as much as it does.
After all, there have been initial projections today.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was reviewed this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of this money.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on the opening and the higher taxation of the offices in Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is estimated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a realignment of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to deliver this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that contribute?
A riddle.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
Of the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital ratio raised by the State and gradually paid to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement states.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment revenue is recorded (the two taxes, i.e., one can cover the project over three years and then draw only from the 4 billion", it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 billions promised will be able to be sought for a long time, is in danger of causing a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Racist hackers and embittered spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a twofold meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence agency (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits do nothing more than what has been read for months anyway in every x-any journal (except for those who own Berlusconi), and Gaddafi's terrifyingly caricatured profile has long offered cabaret artists material for their sketches.
The rule that secret dossiers can only consist of news that is already known is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (still because he does not know where news about the non-existent could be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing else but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same is true of the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise, he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who considers only true what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, was the same as Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a fuss made about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representational tasks, have turned into spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of publicly repeating it violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal brings less the victims than rather the "judges" in distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, at Orwell's time, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother, controlling every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where every movement can be controlled thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one imagines what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control course ceases to be directed unilaterally and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can learn the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It's true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it's also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret because it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means robbing them of any power.
WikiLeaks has not wronged Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult that has been inflicted upon such a powerful force?
It is obvious that in the future the states will not place any more reserved information online - that would be like a hanging on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction sounds like science fiction and romantic at the moment, but I see myself forced to introduce myself to the government agents, secretly moving on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their messages nowhere else but in mere memory, and moreover hiding the few written information they have received in the heels.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically Watergate's espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer today, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for band by spitting from back to front and revealing all the secrets of the montage, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays make it possible to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
High-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including the transfer.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication technology come back to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France speaks out its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fast-resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or premature financing) that have been implemented by developing countries.
And already the rough French fine speeches are revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries committed to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress report by its Member States, press conference, large side events, distribution of brochures.
The transparency operation is remarkable and valued for its real value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which will bring it on the right track to pay respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort has been made without harming public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen to be the benchmark for 2009: international financing will be maintained and will spend 150 million on funding "fast start" over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at official development aid level.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for spending in the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France is pretending to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this yet, and everyone chooses their computing mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission control based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is collected as an equivalent of a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) carry out 100% of their obligations with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and means a comparable commitment.
Nice hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizzy: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France succeeds in making it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; one EU-internal (why do the other member states continue with the donation, if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not allow themselves to be completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question for a relatively short period of time compared to the overall debate on climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently discussed topic): one does not escape the question of "predictability" or the method of accounting for its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive on the issues of dispute as it is on other matters.
So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast-start and its vision of "predictability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international basis of trust necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years of age takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "do not represent a statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but represent an illustrative character of the problems treated", had bought the food normally consumed by a child of about 10 years old at meals and a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined as well as snack shops of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safely carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptor, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually absorbed substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of the cases, this survey is very good to note that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disrupting factor is worrying," the association notes.
Already at breakfast, butter and milked tea alone contain more than ten of the possible carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, exhibits traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study identified traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
Furthermore, the minced steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances, were stuffed.
In the tap water, the analyses have exposed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was "most abundant", and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is likely to be undervalued," the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, for its part, proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilisation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
