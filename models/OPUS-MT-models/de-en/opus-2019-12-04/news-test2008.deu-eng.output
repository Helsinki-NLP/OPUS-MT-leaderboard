Foodstuffs to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the euro area was the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro-zone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1% was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been based on only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the US, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the central rate and, in its discretion, the interest rate reduction would encourage the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment to create an inflation spiral.
The ECB is committed to keeping the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the process of being "agreed" on inflation in order to avoid the need for later action.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a record 12-year high in November; in Spain, the rate increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the euro-zone was responsible for the increased food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost US $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3% inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Locates Government Crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the support for the socialists, according to Gallup, has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
In the case of the party-loyal voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) are against a fifth (20 percent) agreement for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry hurdle: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "very bad" been so high (41%), while another 46% consider it to be "pretty bad."
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, the families again see the change in their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration in the situation; only one-tenth of the population is expected to be improved.
A Gallup survey carried out in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historical high - considered the Prime Minister's work to be "rather bad as right."
Thirteen percent of the respondents have a high level of trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% of mistrust against the head of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think that the discontent with the Prime Minister could be tackled even without a change of government.
If, after the riots last October, 35% had still been in favour of the government and the head of government, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty," and another 20% would vote "probably."
By comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55% would go "with certainty" to the urns, and a further 15% would consider their participation to be "likely." In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
In addition to the group of participants in the "certainly" referendum, the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budapest trading area continued this year to maintain the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the exception that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gaddaság
In the Budapest trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1,000 HUF were registered.
After prices in the food markets "galloped" last December, the rate of inflation has not been dramatic in percentage terms, compared with the already high, previous level of output.
However, it has a certain deterrent effect on consumers that what they had paid for in the last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magical 10,000-HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets under investigation.
= = References = = = = External links = =
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and living fish remained almost at the previous year's level, but the prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy have increased considerably.
The prices for flour and bread were in line with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread wakes for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price fall in the product to less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola pawnbottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including pawnshop cost only 257 HUF.
However, this year in the "Napi" basket comparison Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora was the most expensive.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 compared to the Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased each by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the most expensive one of this year was 12%, while the increase between the most cheap basket of last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206,00 Forint, but the increase in VAT was noticeable at the prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has hit the trade very badly: it seems that the department stores were not able to decide the price margin they should apply to the individual articles, as the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was inconceivable.
(If the dealer does not plan the circulation speed of a product, he may fall for substantial profits in the price margin, which is based on the traffic intensity.)
The price of the "Napi" basket was so radical last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase has been observed, and the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This in turn does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic food products, the Statistical Office found more than 30% inflation over the period of 12 months.
So in about addition to flour also for eggs.)
However, if you look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has even in the worst case increased by hardly more than 10 percent.
It is clear that flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they have been able to turn the drastic price increase on the multinationals.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable food goes in pallets across the shop tables.
Wednesday morning, in all three department stores, there were endless snakes at the Kassa, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Saving many places on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to an improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overloading of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not very conducive to the containment of the infections, says the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, the disinfectants are also saved.
In the trauma department of the János hospital, an MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not been carried out since then because of the bacteria still in the patient's body.
Until 10 December of this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens from hospitals were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals, but the dark rate is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by the MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in their nose without it causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, almond inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-curable.
However, if the means are used too high or incorrectly, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant, which rapidly spread in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
These bacteria may cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis, especially in patients with a weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in elderly, or low body weight patients.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such events are part of the day-to-day disease.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only did not exist where it was not sought.
Resistance to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections in hospitals caused by MRSA would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the control of the development or spread of the multi-resistant agent, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old-age homes, the hospitals should examine the patients who have been given it and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, the microbiological sample collection is not used so often.
Not least because there are no grants from the State Health Insurance Fund for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a remarkable MRSA infection, the medical director of the Epidemiology Centre said.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotherapy should be targeted, i.e., microbiological studies are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always respected by hospitals.
Among the outpatient, or in basic care, microbiological sampling is even less rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
Saving the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is the most frequently transmitted by the care staff from one patient to the other.
This is why the washing of hands, or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplets infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient in the local hospitals.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds are close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the financially less well-placed hospitals it even happens that there is a saving on disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that really favour the development of infections.
Such infections are shown to be far less common there, or can be stopped the further spread of the pathogen, where these protective measures are being observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
To get to grips with MRSA infections causes enormous costs for health insurance, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was included in the government programme.
According to the first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the tendency of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death-handlebar police chief was not drunk
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident, was neither alcoholic nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press officer of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the official report was submitted on the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he took the tax.
The former police chief bog with his own car in the XXII district into the Kossul Lajos street, and has run over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked place.
(However, according to StVO, this is not a mitigating fact - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, succumb.)
The pedestrian was killed after he was admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then returned his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has launched its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigators from the very beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Vres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday, with a total value of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects carried out by the Cohesion Fund with grants.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be devoted to the budget financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on as part of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be used in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Vres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary, a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The credit interest is EURIBOR-bound and the loan is provided by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is looking closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the most cheap EU market, but which is becoming more expensive rapidly?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re / Max Division.
Bulgaria is at present undoubtedly the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European region, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains are the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa among the most popular, at the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast," the "Solar Coast," and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the Renners, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also more and more in demand.
According to estimates by re / Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's interior has also attracted investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very cheap area of Russia has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offers highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, and so, in addition to the summer and winter season, it is also in the other two seasons to attract tourists.
Therefore, forward-looking investors are already buying in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria also want to change their life change.
Most of the buyers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down either buy revitalized real estate by 50-100,000 euros, or come down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good access and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are written in great detail, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is made up of businessmen who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term increase in value.
However, real estate in the capital is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the growing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been a 21 per cent increase in prices.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian progeny
As Minister of the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the meeting of experts will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the post-2012 emission reduction measures, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
A strong debate is under way between developed and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but they would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the developed countries are prepared to support developing countries in addition to the reduction of emissions, both financially and technologically.
An agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, probably at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the "Piac és Profit."
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (in terms of 1990 levels), whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be successful, and that the Union would even be prepared to work for a 30% reduction, if other major industrial countries in the world, or developing countries are also prepared to meet their commitments in a strong and responsible manner.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the States that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, while the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed itself to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the years 1985-87 - a target that the country will meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The use is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only come into force after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN in its recent report, which is excellent with the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and the increase of the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have very serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army Protests on YouTube
British Army units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase their popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special Units stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The images, which are shot with a camera on helmets, are controlled at the air-force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 under the "defenceheadquarters" to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, as well as the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the people about the actual objectives of the foreign operations.
Such published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional TV advertising, said defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message in themselves, as they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
American advertise with game
The army, however, must also fight against amateur recordings, which, in addition to the carefully worked, censored recordings, also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the most important is the loss, but the bloody side of the war is not shown.
By the way, many videos of the war scene in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been loaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genus."
The Americans, however, are advertising in a somewhat different way, with the free-of-charge shooting game "America's Army," in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-wide simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
The Minister of Labour, Mónika Lamperth, is by no means at all minimal: instead of a Christmas party, she is organising a working conference at which her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogas.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure Christmas mood with Tombola or toast to the civil servants' hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The largest Christmas party of a ministry is held this year in the defence department, but the staff of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas party of the orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "mission party" family members are served by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
In comparison with other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are overstepping the lines.
The 4.32 million Forint Christmas party of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, and about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola draw.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The house rental was 1 million Forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented for the celebration.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible.
What's with the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [original] one said: there was no ball dress or suit obligation at the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are preparing each for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health is organising the celebration for the staff in its own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference on the end of the year.
It is expected that about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and pogatches, the celebration will take place with 350,000 forint.
The Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai will be with his colleagues simply to toast in the Ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organising a Christmas party in its own Festsaal, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forint per head - around this money there is a buffet reception with a subsequent toast.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM's staff have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites to a New Year's reception on January 20, and this time the Ministry's Christmas party is cancelled.
The one hundred guests are invited to the castle of Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the department, the expenses are estimated at 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a brief speech by the Minister and end with a restrained fright.
As the relevant press services report on [original] request, there will be neither a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the costs of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the party, which is held in the Museum of the Arts and Crafts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite duration of the strike beginning on Monday.
A protest general meeting is held on Saturday, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - the work is laid down.
It is expected that there will be significant traffic barriers due to the fact that rail transport is almost completely closed and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will also be on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for the coordination of the actions on Monday.
A protest general meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday, all the organisations that have joined the strike will put down the work for an indefinite period of time, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees will meet to discuss the way forward.
In view of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that there will be a vote on the health insurance law only in the later evening hours, or at least at midnight.
The strikes that start on Monday will have to be expected to have significant traffic obstacles: the railway companies will lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will be silent.
At the same time, there will be a direction in many places of the highway.
The call for strike was followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations have announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others are planning a temporary job.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the German Railways VDSZSZ have not yet reached an agreement on sufficient services, even though more and more people are on the road, especially around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV is striped from the start of operations to 1: 00 p.m., the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 am, the LIGA electricity and heat trade unions lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, for example, the Democratic teachers' union, have called for 2 and 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is in a state of alternance at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the league is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and presents a new approach to social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
The third requirement is that the eligible professional groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which is part of the League Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer on the side lines submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases State risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, established this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary," have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "risk-warning report" states, among other things, that in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is "the strengthening of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsies in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term."
The main reason for this was the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provocation of such an argument, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition."
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make it impossible for reasonable dialogue, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the huge attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, in particular as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been in the upswing, so since summer 2007 several "national self-defence association" have been established.
"These groups are common in their definition of themselves as civil organizations, while they openly boast of preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (civil protection, state defense, order prevention), calling for the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it was said.
And further, all of this is done in accordance with the method that is trying to disguise various political aspirations based on the political and party defiance of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association is not only to avoid legal obstacles that could arise in the course of the registration of the court - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region "- it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-East Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the right-wing-wing Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass riots took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the events as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation was "national protection."
In her opinion, a real "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state remained unactive and insufferable - so political capital.
And further, the initiative would have launched a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Roma also respond to the threats by organising their own protection, it is stated in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and, if risk-changing trends are visible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Public holidays are not always public holidays
In Hungary, public holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redisposing of working days around the public holidays has now established, but the coming year will give us less such days.
In the EU and in America, too, there is something else called "holiday."
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and free days.
Working-free days are mostly church holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we are celebrating New Year's Eve: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's celebrations can rest.
All year round, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th of March, which is reminiscent of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the memorial day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the foundation of the state, on 1 May the work is celebrated, on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "shift of working days" has proved itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be worked out, the Minister of Labour has for a long time been laying down its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, to public employees and public service officials alike.
Only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, including on public holidays, are excluded.
This year the working order is only mixed up by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country will remain formal, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve take time compensation, or the special holiday for which it has been suspended.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or the end of the week, so that there will be less redisposing in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second redisposing is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October you will have to work on Friday, 24 October in advance.
The end of the year will, however, be completely in the mark of the holidays, after everything is and will remain in place as of December 24, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six terrifying little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that don't even notice us anymore: they bring "color" to everyday life at the workplace.
The only question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings, consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That it missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it up to you, perhaps by calling the marketing department and saying in repentance, you would have forgotten to direct the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the thing is done with an apology.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what can really give your colleagues unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Lending something you don't own?
There's hardly anything more annoying than a document, office equipment, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the paper machine was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost pen found on a colleague's desk?
Without asking questions, we should not borrow anything from our colleagues, because they are rightly being annoyed when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put any couverts or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you for yourself: none more, if you really need it.
What about our colleagues' private lives?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with who?
Where and why?
One should not, if possible, tie the information (or conjectures) about the private life of the colleagues to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave rather than to be directed towards those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Report sick for no reason?
When you call the office to call in sick by calling for painful headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unstoppable work, projects with fixed dates now have to be done instead of yourself.
So it is not a bad thing for colleagues to play with them!
If one already knows the day before that one will not make it to the office the next day, or that something could come up that must be left at home, one should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, chiche, phone
One is in the middle of his work, but is it suddenly disturbed by the loud chicory of the colleagues?
Unintended to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
One should not annoy colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which are carried over their heads), trample, permanent scorn or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not very deep in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed in time, one has forgotten to send an important letter or important news, one should not seek the guilt of one's own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, we should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best way to admit your mistakes is to apologize if others were also affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for the failure, is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and sluts: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
It is not even then that one should dress so much more slowly if the workplace would actually allow it!
Do not get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress in the office - if you wish, also beautiful and elegant!
I would like to make it quite clear to all - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic.
A strange melody sounds out of the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene has not spoiled us with quality electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, many new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage skirt is "in" again with its guitar chitches, the local Electropop proves: there are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, even in the band Yonderboi, before he began to go his own way - perhaps because a host house does not tolerate two pamphlets.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of jazz, electronic, and pop melted, however, it was only when he came to him with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" made its first album from 2002 under the top 50 native albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was the almost only trend-setter that could be marketed in the West.
Zagar and his band were in doubt "trendy," but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album, "Cannot Walk Fly Instad," which is now released, could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the move with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but in addition to the essential character of the music, the fair guitar - corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends - appears, the influences of the rock 'n' roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle," presented himself at the premiere at the Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio player - the mr2 Petőfi, who has been sending pop music from early to late, has gradually set the earworm to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love," which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So you're all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and non-prolific, but it can only be produced for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also be created from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to receive works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In a foreign country, especially to the west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go on concerts, but also the older audience.
They are much more attentive to the trends in pop music that happen around them, because they also think they are part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience have in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many of your music hear?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more are coming to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, the music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the immature changes of the moment.
But I noticed one thing: if you want to do it right, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We are not really going his way, not to mention that one is always trying to interpret this into our music.
We see each other more as a team player, who trust in the other's musical presence and let them unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us came out of his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" is first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that was to be used as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the final of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why it is she, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to put together the choir of gifted soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-person choir was born - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized as "Underground Divas."
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls play it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number "needs something."
The chord sequence has called for a voice.
I sang the melody the same night, and later they learned the girls.
It all came at a practical and frightening moment of the day.
I remember I was quite electrified at the time, but the "Divas" had to be.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no role, they sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage in the back.
Is it on purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were in the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from and where it was going, let us just let these particular wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would like others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the case of musical work, there was actually none at all, there were more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma," where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock 'n' Roll Goes To The Girls," where the groove didn't want to work for a long time, but it all gradually joined together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and even now that I "let go" the album.
At present, it is "Prophet Is A Fool," "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same."
Cam broker risked billions due to a sense of inferiority
Groundless scam
His former employee, Jerome Kerleit, is the name of the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came about by almost five billion euros because of him.
It seems, however, that Kermuch was only a big player who wanted to do it in the same way as his colleagues, was certainly not unable.
In contrast to all major bank houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He is rather psychically weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, as is clear from the statements made by the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, he was a person who had made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion in his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were already first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those that had previously had pay-off problems, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kermuch didn't believe it and kept it right.
At the end of the year, it had up its profit to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I had earned the first half-billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kermuch admits and says that he definitely did not keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has forged documents so that he can't get caught.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profile
He was afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to step up his position.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51000.
After two years he was an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
But he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"Already at my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "Kerleit explained to the investigation officer.
But soon after his entry the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he made a lot of money by putting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombing.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses were supposed to know about everything, or they knew.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the big blow.
On a single day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did they get to him?
Suspect he was on a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A real estate agent who does not take a holiday is one who does not want to be looked at in the cards, "Kerleit concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to get to 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion (approximately EUR 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013 at all.
About 125 billion kroner come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to get some 100 billion kroner from the "Enterprise and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will be used for transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds to innovative enterprises.
The aim is to finance companies for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the new candidate countries in the money-laundering process from EU funds.
Nicaragua court confirms 20 years in prison for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
But later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda at the Nicaragua metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, it is currently unclear whether the former head of state (1997-2002) of this Central American state will be back behind bars.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to leave Alemán's sentence at home or whether to go to prison.
A court showed four years ago that Alemán had regularly shifted government money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this household?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it was presented by Minister Sobotka (by this party) and the ČSSD could not therefore allow itself to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-observed, yet very important law in its rest.
It's kind of a paradox.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is covered by the government's and opposition's power struggle.
This is a more grateful issue for the media, and so they pay more attention to it.
A political dispute is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
State budgets have had three weaknesses in the past social-democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot be eliminated at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is legally binding, not only pensions, but also social expenditure that the "tacit" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budgetary deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and, to a certain extent, under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, with the exception of income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often spent unthought-out bonds, which made them overindebted their city houses.
In recent years, they have been able to pay these debts through the mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks they had received from the State on the train of privatisation.
Now this source is already sealed.
As far as we only stick to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
For a few years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a period of growth that the ČSSD has been celebrating without any hesitation.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments were even more indebted to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonably than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been overblown to a huge extent in recent years.
Although it has been possible to remove some of the immoral populist expenditure that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if the retirement age and the reform of the pension are not to be postponed in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, it will be left with nothing but pure management.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that the ruling politicians will then become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner planned for 2008 would be quite unnecessary if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we do not want the government to be pure administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees to wish for rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
In this way, more than $100 billion will come to the currency markets by means of auctions.
At these auctions, the banks are auctioning interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion at auction, and another 24 makes it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time, following the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to counter or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, that is, the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can give," wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion because of unspent loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done when it is decided to do so," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he said.
Central banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after they have failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used to rent money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of borrowing each other's money, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks is helping to heat up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: The debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus returned to the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change on Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet," he said that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mix of government representatives and non-government organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies them and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only a substitute for a real solution to present problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President, when presenting his book, stressed that his subject was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often meet with caricatures of my views."
So now interested parties could read his attitude unabated.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He was, after all, an academic, capable of understanding and assessing professional practices, had experience in statistics and was also a national economist.
The main statement of the book was that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consensus among the scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
In addition, as someone who has experience of totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views, he considers this to be a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly said that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already talked about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people were not able to exchange their license
600000 drivers missed the time limit to exchange their old driving licence, the validity of which expired at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can make it possible to issue a new licence by the end of the year.
The Ministry, however, does not fear that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the streets without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive at all have not changed their driving licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of footnotes, the offices of the capital are covered with applications, and the interest in exchange was still growing this week.
The city administration makes up about 2000 customers every day.
You have to get up for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driver's license.
The exhibition of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Automobiles who do not create the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license will be liable to a fine from January.
The culprit will pay a maximum of 2000 kroner.
But the police can also make it a reminder in the transgression.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, the community may also impose a punishment that does not drive at all.
It was said that he could be threatened with a punishment of even 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry has already called on the offices to make a mutilation and to impose a maximum of 1000 kroner.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one threatened a thousand-year-old.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not an identity card that everyone must have, and that is a valid one.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their license.
It is enough to take him to the relevant municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with leading positions from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court reduces penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who were accused of having done a joint thing with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced its sentence by one or two years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision of the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged with this matter, but first of all he is in the hands of the first-instance judgment.
In other processes, however, he had already received a total of 16 years of penalties.
That's all he can be sentenced to.
In January, a district court held 19 persons guilty mainly of participation in robbery, and today the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have been arguing with the indictment from the beginning on the grounds that it is a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, in consultation with Berdych criminals, members of the police gave information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape the prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The charge is about the crimes of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, it is a matter of robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious injuries, but also of the presumption of office and the possession of illicit weapons.
In the case of house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammo with steel core, a laser target telescope and a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself by many million crowns through their robberies.
In addition to almost 20 men in this case, Berdych and a number of others were legally found guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's area have to answer in another trial, and other cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main negotiation has so far been missed by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish detention and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children switched - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to ask the hospital in Třebíč for 12 million crowns of compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The right-wing representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore completely in agreement with the Veleba proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is a lot too high," said Dostál after today's negotiations.
"But in order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side had to draw up.
We'll find out if it's worth anything.
However, we are of the opinion that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of people together, "said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the Jabloňov family wanted a million kroner for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion that he had prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they were accused of being able to prevent the confusion of the newborn.
The women, on the other hand, get along worse with the consequences of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is going on right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses of the Třebíč maternity hospital on December 9 last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the head of the district of Vysočina (Bohemian-Moravian High) handed over 100000 kroner to each family as a replacement for expenses incurred by the hospital in Třebíč, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law.
In case of doubt, they have to make use of a reserve fund, only for exceptional reasons can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far allocated relatively low amounts of compensation to those concerned, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, and, exceptionally, millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Walachei."
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walache King," but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor in many years' work.
Polívka did not take part in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitar," said after the trial of Polívka's lawyer.
All of them introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walache Kingdom."
Harabiš is the same opinion.
"We have done almost ten years of work.
Money creation and concepts of activities, "he said.
According to him, the cause is a fight for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasitic in our work, "he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walache King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that was not related to the intention to establish a fictional kingdom at that time.
A few years later, Harabiš thought of spending Walachian passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity was crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined the foundation of the company "Walache Kingdom."
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners reductions when visiting his farm and his theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also pointed out today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" show for his business intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Walache kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had devoted themselves to him.
The cooperation of the parties in the conflict today lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But since then the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, which culminated in the removal of "King Boleslav I elected until the day of Saint-Nimmerleins."
At the suggestion of Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková, the leading role was then used as a royal mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed the action against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
The competition for the throne and half a princess, prepared by Harabiš, could bring clarity in the dispute.
A new king was to come out of it.
He didn't want to give out details and an appointment.
"We don't want to rush.
It was supposed to be like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka is also able to register quietly, "added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Wrap forward parts
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear connection, the steering and the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combination called SW is a bit further, and I only have to review my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headspeed in the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the combi is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Move on
I only go through the interior for a short time, not to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I have objections only because of the poor middle tunnel.
I would like to welcome a little more design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may be complaining about too short seats or head restraints.
The side hold has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the space supply is concerned, one can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combination, the lack of head-free is also removed.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the loading room.
I must call this (also because of the unfolding back window) a very well-loaded and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with seat belts, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, let themselves be drawn apart and also hold on to heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the most sold vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by a clearly visible 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when a child's car is invited.
But in order to highlight the positiva, I have to mention the very flat loading space or the very low loading edge after changing the back seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, that's what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family Hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400er petrol engine in the amount of 329900 kroner is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car again beats with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had headgear, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper, electric window levers at the back and...
The total cost of the car is 531900 kroner.
This is a lot, but you can put together the extra equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So the only choice left is which brand you want to choose.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is not successful
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which causes local fears about the further development of local education.
The integration of the Eastern European countries has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and riots among students have transferred to relations between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself by the fact that the boy had offended her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene with a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two minor girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist comments to the man and cast stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks, "a mother of Slovak students of the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even called the conflict with the immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks have been reported coming here to find work.
Some 30000 Slovak students therefore attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you choose only the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and stunning cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to a great extent.
But only on an island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the US (especially during the Prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew, over the wide boulevards, cars were used, which were one of the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you like.
And the cult cars of the fifties go around in Havana to this day, because the once imported shigulis and fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and moist air.
May Havana, especially its oldest part, have come down strongly, there is nowhere to be found in the vicinity as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
There was a green light for this development in terms of the need for much-needed money for tourism.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-operated narrow-track trains to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and this is how you can see the bumpy and fully functioning locomotives, the old people of which have long been in the museum.
Excursion objectives
The most important places do not leave out the majority of the visitors to Cuba.
You don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
It is only to be mentioned that in the already mentioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on the lime floor.
The mogotas, the limestone hills and the rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities there was a gathering of fertile soil, which also covered weathered rock areas with dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought her glory and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country in the fifties of the last century.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it was unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach of Playa Ancón or the "valley of sugar factories."
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which is alive after the darkness, and where the music is not silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This little town in the east of Cuba some call it the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo must overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human interventions.
This eastern suburb of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its world heritage directory thanks to its unspoiled nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in fact it was born about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, stands, are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, about all of this you could write many pages.
But, as you say, better look with your own eyes.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, say Americans.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of the Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not run according to their ideas, and in the Scottish Edinburgh the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, called for more activity for NATO units, the UK sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in strengthening development aid.
"A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part of it is to enable the inhabitants to start a development of the economy and security themselves, "says the British Minister for Defence of the BBC's Des Browne.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached an absolute limit on the organization and equipment of the units.
More specifically, they call for further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the concrete objectives for the next time and the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said the same thing today.
"I am not pleased with what we have at our disposal in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little, "said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency, at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
There has also been a dispute among the countries involved over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
For example, Germany was criticised for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "said Gates.
The British tabloid "Sun" this week called the German soldiers a lazy fur.
"Afghan non-students uncloaked: The Germans play games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a post that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image newspaper went over to the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will be high-speed in 2009 on a trillion
Each Czechs has a national debt of 84000 kroner.
The total grant increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to make a debt of 159.2 billion cones this year.
At the beginning of December the Ministry, however, reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of public budget policy.
The Czech Republic's public debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they thus increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its state debt data from early October.
Each Czechs has a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state has been indebted by more than 111 billion kroner.
"To date, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crowns, "said David Marek, an analyst of the Patria Finance server iHNed.cz.
It is similar to Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance: "We could come to the overrun of a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we have not yet met.
If it shows that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take up to 2010.
But I do not expect such a change, "he said.
Debt growth
The state debt comes from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
The domestic government debt has now increased to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The government's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the public debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the growth is mainly in the case of debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand this shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes, "said Pikora.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of government debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to receive 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December the Ministry, however, reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of public budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion kroner instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
In addition, these are maximum planned funds for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-million-lion pension reserve, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and the rates for the European Investment Bank's bonds of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment and subsequent expulsion by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic Prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be whipped.
After several complaints by parents of students at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher at the Unity High School of Khartoum was taken up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter starts in September, when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class Deddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, report school leaders Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself was not wearing a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic Prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to get too close to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, and in his view this is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion that many students share of the teacher who describe as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks of religion in the class.
Remember that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common name in the UK, for which 14 different spelling exist in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of reverence to the Prophet (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last meeting of the negotiations in Vienna on Wednesday.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion meeting on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace is at stake in the region, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, called for their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the referral on 10 December
The troika, which is the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet on Monday for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% of Albanian speaking inhabited province could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika last August had been commissioned by the UN for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of being under the administration of the UN, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with the future.
Pristina is ready to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in favour of them.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regret.
He added, however, that the plan proposed by Belgrade is part of the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the war of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision would be made only and only in the Security Council, where their Russian allies had a right of veto.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanian-speaking population would be in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had met on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must cease its colonization work, said Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace to which they had agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately sought a peace treaty to clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term includes the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians are mainly about: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, who were expelled from their home country in the course of the 1948 conflict, which lies in the present state of Israel.
According to the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he committed himself to the coming ceasefire negotiations being conducted directly and without interruption and to the efforts he would make to stop them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which exist side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before it decided to take part in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries, which offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab prince says in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, a police car was driving on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on patrol, and he was driving at 40-50 km / h, without blue light, explains a police spokesman.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without registration, that is not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without a helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had failed its way from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol control carried out in the case of vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (burdened fender, splinted windscreen, broken bumper) shows the strength of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the District Attorney of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger," in coordination with the main public security management of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she would not be responsible for the police at this stage of the investigation of the IGPN.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, have confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-collar has arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the foot-rest on the floor, showed that the two vehicles had remained hacked together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be the subject of a technical assessment.
The body names of the two victims were taken out yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor was made that the police had left the scene very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude any serious error.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation for which further investigations are needed and in which we must be very careful.
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed police officer limping.
Two more tried to revive one of the young people who had the fourth on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the events and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow the police to say that the police did not help the young people.
The first aid was given to these young people.
The fire department is here now.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor, in turn, stressed.
In Pakistan the tension is increasing
On Monday, the Pakistani police have put down the first demonstrations since two days before, General Musharraf had declared the state of emergency.
According to evidence, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades that the forces used there.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, advocates of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (north-east).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the people to send flowers and waste to the judges who had spoken against the state of emergency, and to those who have given an oath to Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-governmental and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News said.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the order of command over the army and to become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call of the state of emergency, declared on Monday the vice-minister for information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term as president would end.
The Vice-Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country, according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of the pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account the adverse pregnancies (24%), as well as the badly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Law, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the adverse pregnancies (24%), as well as the badly planned or unforeseen births.
The ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which states that the percentage of patients using the pill between 20 and 40 years of age has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has, however, improved the control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are now carefully planned.
With one of five pairs even calculated precisely on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) crew will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for the continuation of the scientific work on the station.
A daring exit, which has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Space Shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part, which is to soon record the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5 tonnes power generation module via solar panels already located on the ISS in order to put it in its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew moved on to the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, the span of which is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be seen as accordion, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the space ferry Discovery for a control course and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was flawed, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre long remote-controlled arm of the space ferry, which had been attached to the station, to do the repair.
He is one of NASA's best space walkers.
Large, durable, very clever, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After having carefully examined the damage, he separated the faulty cable and fixed a kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second space walker, who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey bat, wrapped with an isolator to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors that generate several hundred volts, the astronauts had thought and made on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned today to the space ferry Discovery to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS is sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Air and Defence Group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros in order to counteract the A400M's residues, the share EADS is currently showing a significant drop on the Paris Stock Exchange.
At present, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again in relation to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent group of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the EADS's business performance has fallen by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
The group had originally planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the urns: the mass of the Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very sealed election campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a message to the voters on public channels, who have already been recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as a top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything go through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and he was pleased to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers who are accused of interference - his favorite issue during the campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and we hope for honest elections, very transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they have lost their way.
It denounces a campaign of oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, for ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrators, according to his lawyer continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Soviticus
After these parliamentary elections with no tension, two more questions are raised:
Who will take up Putin's successor as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
As he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the almighty party of United Russia, will choose the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Soviticus, they are not the master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg is even further down: in this country, which has been Christianized five centuries after Europe, civil society has only developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again attached to the model of a paternalistic state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation says.
Today, the Russians are free to renounce the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the USSR's disintegration.
Why do you think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all social groups, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to hold the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian government leaders) lead the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think long?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to replace them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located on a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, that is, individual and name-related, that is, on request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the US, agreed to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to carry out research, in particular on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health of forced workers, explains Reto Master, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, have been opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the delicate nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some of the victims of deportation.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been brought together after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen more than 300 permanent employees are working on tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the research centre for anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to obtain a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, the trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India are hoping to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will make a huge contribution to the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued, and the Asian and European giants are exchanging goods worth EUR 47 billion and services worth EUR 10 billion each year, this week, Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's delegation to New Delhi, said, and regretted that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will be present on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England notes the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned to reduce the current recurring concern about the credit conditions and announced an offer of £10 billion with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly severe at the end of the year and to give banks a greater degree of certainty as to the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of their savings during the maintenance phase that starts on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, in a communication.
The Bank further states that this way, on 6 December, will be put into circulation by 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros), at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This is usually done for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is ready to take further measures to maintain the different interest rates of the interbank lending with its basic interest rate from day to day.
The interbank interest rate varies from day to day and was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has fallen to 6.6%, a little higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalty fees that the banks had prevented from using.
According to some rumours, increased by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more favourable rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text produced in a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, of which the majority of them flotted the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the PPP, a transport check or the limitation of the rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which led to a partial heavy exchange of words between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the TV show by Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchasing power.
The leader of the MP Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the financial correction proposal that had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 on Bilboard.com announced.
C3 is hosting the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival will take place from August 8-10 on a 500-year-old private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people a year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitudes Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of production, licensing concessions and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been at, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn are working in parallel to each other to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates on the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at the Grand Park Chicago, after it has benefited in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to reach $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while our people are rather on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to combine these two concepts in one way or another, in order to give the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way in the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is pleased to bear the burden of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter is opposed to disclosing the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that I hope will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large," in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners in C3, who received the top independent promoter prize of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is meeting the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the terminator is against it.
These loosening attempts are one of the delegate's tasks.
A political "delicate mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denies the "Runaway Productions."
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best, "he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the first priority at the moment is the production of the cinema there.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the West Coast Festival, although Sundance's, Denver's, Seattle's, or San Francisco's, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange ahead of an end-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already ripping their hands with regard to the coming end-year rally.
However, the experts cannot make any safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December is usually accompanied by a positive market development
However, it is not advisable to draw up short-term forecasts and only on the basis of statistics, especially when serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not support such a strong increase in the course over the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and of market participants, which, due to the lack of secure equity funds, mainly invest in pension funds, which is strongly affected by the growing trend towards profitable assets.
As a result, these experts believe that the stock exchange will be more of a lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US central bank's interest rate, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of an increase in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, President of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a good time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish Ibex stock index has already lost 4% of 15.945.7 points since its maximum mark on November 8.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional, at this time, grant of the pension fund.
However, the expert points out that this year things could be a little different, especially because of the final year rally that is taking place in the second week of December, and therefore right after the day of the Constitution.
The analyst considers that price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank Inveris, the previous assessments of the market situation are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a future deviation from the index values, the extent of which would depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values to drive the Ibex to new maximum, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney says that this year the big values are on the line.
The expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha of the Bank Inveris assures that the increases in connection with the banking and industrial sectors will be accompanied.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on a catch-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, according to the expert.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during the Christmas days, the market will be determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has had only two falling rates.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real final year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered by 28.17 percentage points, December had a rate increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth year in a row (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and can also show an end-year rally will be shown.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economic regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of Spanish institutions, as Popular as the first banking group is the jump to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 20.30h and start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly stated that its opening hours were extended in the branches, has not yet taken a final decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement that will close 75% of all branches on Saturdays and open for it on a week's day in the afternoon, even if not for the customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which will adapt to business opening times, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is the intention of the Popular to pursue with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can capture the commercial customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank would like to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of the branches already located in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is linked to a new room design of the branches, which is characterized by a more recent, more colorful design.
The competent bank representative, Ángel Rivera, assures that the restructuring would not require any major investment but would be accompanied by an increased recruitment, since a branch now needed no more than six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, said Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and the Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the name of Mundocredit, which specializes in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PoularMax the model of the BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally come to the agreement to sell mobile phones using external bank personnel.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus overcomes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the Managing Director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the market. The channel he led had increased its value by twice his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampen his joy: this is exactly what is hurting me; not that we have a higher growth, but that we have had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has been reporting a total loss of 40.5% since January so that its market value is 2.193.46 million to half.
The market value of other listed communication companies, on the other hand, is increasing; in the case of Sogecable, the market value is increasing to 3,571 million, for Prisa (editor of the Cinco Días magazine) to 2,518.53 million and for Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 is based on the fact that it is two similar companies, said Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually act on the market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level seems uncertain.
A week ago, Telecinco declared its intention to become the first television channel this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue, which was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiesaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the channel would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million in the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the market (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business was only 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the Telecinco's better stock exchange performance is the high Payout ratio that the company could have had up to now: in 2006, the company managed by Alejandro Echevarría led a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far been much more and more indicated.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high return on effect and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: As a result of the multiple incentives and the proliferating market, Telecinco (buy) measures a more favourable position than Antena 3.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to reduce expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and poor economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary preparation, which today ended its meeting with the Congress decision in the Senate on the supplementary / amendment requests related to the project, the government published the provisions of the new law, with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congressmen and Senate members, who had in their negotiations and votes the aim of establishing the best possible rules to ensure the security of investors and to regulate individual business activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market operation.
In addition to the modernisation of the financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the Investment Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows for the provision of financial advice to both specialised companies and to natural or legal persons and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory companies that are linked to the investment and brokering companies of securities.
It also extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral systems of the securities business and to the systems for the internationalisation of trade contracts, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges the investment companies to make known the priorities of their business profile, the confrontation and the ways in which they deal with risks on the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
The Economic Commission of the Congress provided for further amendments in retrospect, with the decision that, due to its high level of risk, the debt bond with the title must now be considered as complex financial resources for the investor being confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the working areas of qualified economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation, which restricted the areas reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign account, does not need authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialisation of products and for the purchase of customers at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPI) increased by five-tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat for the assessment of inflation within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare the location and quality of the data to US products by the publication of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared early by applying the same approach as in the harmonised index of consumer prices, but at the same time using different statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
The Spanish Statistical Office (INE), however, warned that the indicator in advance was only a guide and therefore did not have to be in line with the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Vice-President of the Council and the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, in the halls of the Congress building, Solbes noted that even if the current figure is not good, the inflation difference between Spain and the other members of the monetary union had remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin calculated with Northern Rock revenue of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
The value of Northern Rock has fallen by more than half after the Bank had asked the British Central Bank for an emergency loan in mid-September of last year, which is now only £12,000 million (equivalent to EUR 16,800 million).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounted to a record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customers' confidence and, despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, must bring in about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be made up of the facilities of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the £18 billion that is still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to have £50,000 million (equivalent to about €70 million) flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve his goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Pardo Popular), a part of the town of Murcia, on the basis of the urgent suspicion of being involved in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and at that time Chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, last May, and, according to information from the television station Cadena SER, could be the original conductor of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the information of the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested on the leave of his client's residence on the basis of important burdensome documents that should be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the alleged order payments of Morales to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban construction contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Currently, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. He will therefore lead the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, take over the office of President of the Congress.
For example, José Blanco, PSOE Secretary of the Organization, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero today at the party's headquarters.
In the view of the President, the offer to the former Minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the next elections, the politician from the Mancha would appear to be running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who had announced last November 15 that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead work in the university area for climate protection.
The former Minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had been constantly pushing for his return to political events.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to deprive the citizens of who would take over the position of President of the Congress in the event of a victory, and called this an act of transparency.
If he is actually to take over the office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect, not of insult or of the act, so as to make it seem more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, the impression is that the only place in Madrid where you can't speak calmly and calmly is Congress; so the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to appear to have already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is a ruthless criticism of both the skeptics of climate change and those who focus on social and political debate in this respect, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal makes it difficult to explain the action or non-action of its government, which has made a decisive contribution to the fact that Spain is at the top of the countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol within the EU.
Who is responsible for the failure to meet the requirements, which sectors is the result of this, and why has his government, which proposed the treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he has set out to combat climate change without any confusion.
Which companies will be affected by the changes in the behaviour of the citizens, the individual and collective austerity measures to be implemented and the economic consequences.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for saving the planet.
However, there are and will not be any such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures that can be used to combat climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed to be so dangerous in its choice that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty proverbs without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak, nor charge, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and of enthralling others with its gentleness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bike will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a subject.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana because of a supposed involvement in a city-building corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the mayor's secretary and a hotel entrepreneur were held in custody because of the alleged suspicion of urban-building violations.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from where it was taken to the municipal office and in its premises until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the city administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the search for more than 2 million hectares of unfinished construction of projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4000 apartments on the property after the local administration had received illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six prisoners were presented to the judge today.
According to investigators, the former mayor of Totana and current independent MP Juan Morales is also being investigated.
In addition, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend, who is resident in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is supposed to have acted as a part of Nuaria and have received the bribe.
The investigation is carried out by the municipal authority against urban-building crimes, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives in addition to the arrests carried out 11 further searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regional well-known poultry farming industry, which is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the town of Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of area in Totana, which was to be converted. The aim was to realize a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which in Vigo operates the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a price name of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
Guys, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to present your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat, (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which takes a position on the note published in the same newspaper on November 18; by chance, on the day of the issue of the review of the book of Blackburn.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abiturian who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview of the daily Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, President of the Education Council for Philosophy, asked the teachers to take a more critical position towards Platon and proposed to remove the teaching of Plato from the sublevel curricula for philosophy at gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which would be filed with six months in prison.
But if you take out a music business of less than 400 euros, this is only considered as a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
To take part in a rebellious dispute is a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a imprisonment of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, the authorisation of which has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has put his demands up quite a bit.

My home doctor is giving me one of his long, strange research articles, entitled: Money leads to the activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings of the monthly pay are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was produced using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the science magazine Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life & Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that the brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct in their response and thus received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The State Attorney from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been a relentless search for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Its seat is in the prosecution of the former Yugoslavia's criminal court, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - namely the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Her names are on the list of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary film La Lists de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss state attorney from Belgrade to New York on her plan to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to make their networks closer.
Which insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the amount of which is again dependent on various factors, including age, sex, time of production of the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear about what we are dealing with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance undertaking.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which provides that the company shall receive the insurance premium and in return shall be obliged to provide the corresponding amount of the payment in the event of a damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance which is made up of several factors, including age, sex, date of production of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or use thereof.
Insurance undertakings shall set their prices in accordance with the statistics, so that higher contributions are due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as according to the statistical values and therefore to the companies, they tend to be less accidents than single persons.
The benefit of the vehicle is to affect the frequency of driving and therefore the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In drawing up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that is most likely to meet his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be considered in the selection of insurance in order to be able to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The under-25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles in the choice of low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and young driving licences.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to complete a full-scale insurance, there are still more cost-effective alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full-time self-employed, so that the services of a full-scale insurance are covered, but are offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount of the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the contract is concluded and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europe, a brokerage company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by the car itself.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25, it is in your hand to reduce the insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in the said rates.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a rich year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explained Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
It is therefore most appropriate to choose a full-scale insurance with self-participation.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, as the Spanish head of the European company explains, and adds that the majority of accidents take place in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been lost.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to make full-scale insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate and their contributions are therefore low.
In this case, a full-scale self-contribution insurance (with an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance, which is only used for the third year of the vehicle, is recommended.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is appropriate to conclude a full-scale self-contribution insurance (for an amount of 150 euro) or an extended insurance which only uses a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs that require a thorough selection that is in line with our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the point for the eighth final in Milan
The next Tuesday, in San Siro, the FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point they are missing to achieve their respective goals before the final round of the Championship. The Italians will need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter will decide on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that the Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D games will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will have to take part in the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semi-final for the first time.
This group will be completed in front of everyone else and the draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home, the Keltik Glasgow knows that they would be the first in the event of a victory and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be a defeat in a slump of the club Shakhtar to qualify. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because in nine points of the same, the Ukrainians were allowed to participate; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win at the second game (2-0).
As a result, the Mailländer will try to spoil the Scots' evening. They hope to reach the final of the redesigned championship for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in the first season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the afterplay time (1-0) and by a zero-zero draw on the play.
While Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both the achievement of the Eighth Final and its membership at UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win the third place by winning the UEFA.
20,000 people are visiting the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the start of their first tour in the Canadian Vancouver in front of 20,000 spectators after the band's dissolution in 2000.
"Posh Spice '(Victoria Beckham)," Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said the mood in the reunited band was excellent just before the start of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver.
Around 20,000 people were able to see the concert in the sold out stadium, where a video about the history of the band, which had provided for furore in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which had previously been given to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English football player David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience, which made GM Palace glowing, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden it to him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star did not see our dressing room once, and I am very excited about what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later the group's dissolution, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought why not; so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said to the separation of the band that she had made nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes have been resolved and that they are all very happy again.
However, many things have changed since the last common appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, according to the report of the TV station CTV, the group arrived in a special engine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
When she arrived at the airport, the band was received by an army of nanny.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be next in California, San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on the 23rd of December.
New concerns about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being affected.
Most of the Russian exports of natural gas to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is observed very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit charges from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be more calculated, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% in addition for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important host countries in talks," said the economic minister of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters news agency.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments concerning the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-trial register for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service had no precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission at Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out controls before the employment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-trial records, the Agency does not have the responsibility to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the chief auditor now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record, which will help employers to check in different countries.
"Although we have found some evidence of these controls in some staff documents, they have not been carried out routinely."
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines to a great extent before the job was done, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health service workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in the run-up to the recruitment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the board of directors had problems identifying those employees who were on leave for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation also found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been largely observed.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification controls.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for pre-employment controls for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was concerned to do this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on monitoring prior to the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has hidden five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, among others for the best film.
Awards were also awarded to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and co-actor Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was awarded the best lead actress for the thriller notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film into the world's public.
The awards were presented at a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order are to be found - was shot for only 3 million British pounds.
However, he has presented two awards to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, most commonly known for the cult cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best lead debut.
Rock music was the focus of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer received the prize for the best documentary.
The prize for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg in London playing thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winston, who is on the call to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones Continuation The Kingdom of the Chrysal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize, which was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored. "
The independent film prices, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a complete terrorist attack
Saudi Arabia has revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on the spiritual and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells would have planned to smuggle in missiles.
Sympathists of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid force to protect plants after a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to a domestic ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the prisoners belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally emigrated to the country.
He reported that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, a further 22 of the detainees were planning to kill clerical and security forces.
The government has warned the clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who are looking for Iraq to join with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias regard many clergymen in Saudi Arabia as being in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have been targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector installations.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last five months," a spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior told state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote the "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are branded as disbelieving and renegade.
Among the prisoners were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could show a view of the future of the Earth
The Venus may have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship in orbit show that the planet is even more like a turned-out twin on Earth than it has been aware of before.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbour of the earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary paths, but the Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions would have prevailed on Venus that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have even been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbraked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a very different development course.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, which has examined the planet for a year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while otherwise the planets are quite similar."
"Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like the Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"enriched uranium" seized by the police
One kilo of radioactive material, reported to be enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480.000).
All still open
Mitt Romey said he didn't think it was worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate finally agreed to face a debate on YouTube in which normal voters take up and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party, which is starting the next year's elections.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate, who selected the YouTube clips to be presented to the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half-hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single subject, immigration was the focus of the debate.
The subject is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: the TV station noticed the top of the vote when the candidates were talking strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake the call that he has been forcible in terms of illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly concerned as a question maker, whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressman from Colorado, were able to follow up on this subject.
Neither of the two men have a serious chance of nominating, but both of them stay in the race, perhaps because they used to be harder and harder than others on the immigration poke.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: sharper borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered as torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was urged to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's recent donations and his incidental storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has the party from the beginning and has been convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not very slippery.
No nobles seem to have been sold, no politicians in Paris paid hotel bills, no extra-marital toes.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has disguised donations to the British ruling Labour Party for more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) for four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have been well done without the fought Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the demand for an election, in a stupid way offending the British intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp leader of the Liberal Democrats, said, the once-feared Brown has developed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unskillful rescue of Northern Rock, a hit bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Bad-thought-out proposals to change the tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The tax-authoritative loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative whooping.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military expenditure: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations of David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and her former leader of the performance) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is leaving irrevocably for departure.
However, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel impossible to rule.
People do not like or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he will not have to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service is starting to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and futile.
In one way, the position of Brown is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's misfortune - as in the long "money for nobility" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume that he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't as bad as she looks.
The sins are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely waved.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns, of course, have always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new commitment to political donations is a good example.
The Garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but he was not entitled to make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlessohn, Labour's main financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to indicate that he knew about these confusion, even though most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping for a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - to make the measure full of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, how to find a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in public life, who has been vacant for six months, and to move forward with a radical reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of the labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party mate like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through indisputable righteousness and solid competence.
Carton sharks
Is the credit crisis affecting America's credit card market?
If there's blood in the water, it's just natural that back fins are getting excited.
Now that America's real estate market is on the line, the predators are targeting the country's credit card market.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of exposure from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the bookings and the saturation rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or are more than 30 days late.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its US consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Loss and saturation are still low.
According to Moody, the third-quarter rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency law in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn account for a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus the saturation fees) would increase again whether the general conditions for borrowers are deteriorating or not.
Industry also reports on sound payment rates that show how much of its debt consumers pay each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the volume of expenditure for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will take up credit card debt, now that home credit will dry out.
However, the card exhibitors look at the cash flow rather than on capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay the mortgage rates will fall if the real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, the card debt will become more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also respond much faster and more flexible than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones's main financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a reduction in US credit are to push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former chief financial manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their request in guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was set for January.
But during a hearing in court in front of U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty of a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the aim of an investigation of the government in connection with Enron's decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to enact a deceptive plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless deceptive enron machinations that helped to take the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it had in fact a significant value.
One company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misrepresented Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper, and others saw about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charges.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of conspiracy in two charges for his role in the Enron's bust.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is in a six-year prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper has a three-year and one month sentence in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on the loose because of a $1 million deposit that made it necessary for them to live in the United States in anticipation of the court proceedings.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover up the billionaires' debt or make weak companies appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling is a fine of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats, because it's for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgy of consumption presented for the show, held in a shaded exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built up exhibition stands, hoping to interest new Russians in everything, from mahogany-made yachts to diamond-covered car barbecues, which would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next stand.
"This is a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be so flooded with money like Dallas at its glowing times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to huge wealth and went to Europe in groups where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most visible free-standing money outsiders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
In Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, has attracted ideas about how to sell high-price goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires, worth a total of $670 billion, are part of the second class, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-maintained and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they move through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsa, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking for the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer's clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the neural realms, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to stand in the traffic jam for several hours to visit a future warehouse, which, in no case, put Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives made of platinum, Mövenpick Eiskrem, custom-made billiard, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybären next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitat of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted, blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climber climbers."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the type of sober brands with limited numbers of pieces that would not be marketed on a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil's beds here, said he had sold two 70,000 dollars of mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said to a company that provided high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, that his company had sold the green orange Porsche for 170,000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customers' wishes, said that he had sold three car-cooled grille for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which is similar to each other's chain-arms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tyre that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The cost is $22,000 for a four-time replacement.
"The Russian millionaire who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" is not at the moment expressing much exclusivity, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to the British model, which were full of mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the money pile, mobile phone photos, while leaning back in the middle of the spare wealth, to let friends kneel, or just to take a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Spotted operation suspected at death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving Festival when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healhere restaurant here and watched an ambulance on the white Cape Cod stop two doors further down on West Scott Avenue.
There was a police car there soon after.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical coroner's car coming here," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now, the investigators are trying to find out if she died of a procedure carried out by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxic studies, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," said Mr McCarthy about Mrs Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She was protecting me. "
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control mission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the Prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unapproved, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3: 00 in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have little informed about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was being asked by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castros's house, where a covered rose shrub is in the short front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel marked with "ethyl vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in food and perfume - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find his way into the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said," You have to pay attention to this or that, "he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing. "
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest rates lead to the rise of world stock markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will try to reassure the credit markets by further interest-rate cuts were reinforced by insidious comments by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets increased in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank's president, said that the policy had to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continuing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the market in the light of the signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in the market functions of late September and October."
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and to stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rates.
The comments also helped to calm Wall Street, in the face of further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its world-wide workers, in a cost-reduction measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S & P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The reappearance of credit pressure on the markets had previously been underlined, following a strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European commercial banks, at a significant 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and to feed further funds into the money markets in London increased when the credit tensions were seen to increase the three-month "libor" lending rates between UK banks at 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's to be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, at least under this special title, is here to help the chief coach Peter Moore and the captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electoral offices, if not for those in part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth beating position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is no doubt.
It is never easy to nail exactly, which allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in cricket, where the choice is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular chances in order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
To catch the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind is bound into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both of them had their glowing points and hope for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still fighting to strengthen himself, who made the breakthrough to a major test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that after a further discussion at today's network meeting at the Asgiriya Stadium, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 top-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent record against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the selections as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beat, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the Alleskolner from Essex has a pretty good life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket square and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he recently overlaid a four-wheel vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had seen this from afar, and to say with enthusiasm, "Did you see this?."
Bopara is a much better field player, he cords his middle tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be well-standing if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first bus calls of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the paper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people, "he said, regarding the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to put back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, an 38-year-old Shia teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraq did not allow to work.
His Shiite neighbours in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-supported militia helped to expel Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today, "said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing peace in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local "groups affected citizens" who were armed and in cooperation with the American military were defending their neighbourhoods.
But more said about being forced home by visa problems and sealed funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well to visit al-Maliki Syria and the government no longer urged the Iraqis to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have diminished.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarland have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-Saar for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan is the smallest state of the country on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities have been working closely with neighbouring countries from a tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
The proportion of foreign students is correspondingly high at 15.6 percent.
But also the country's children bring the Saarland to higher education in an above-average number - many of them without a degree in high school.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire the right to study at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points higher than the Federal average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively strong.
In terms of population, the provision of dual courses is the second best in Germany.
However, despite the practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we have launched a number of reforms at the general education schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced country-wide comparative tests.
The last year of Kita is free of charge - a model that has now been copied by other federal states.
The long-term improvement in the performance of the students will only be shown in future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavaria are expecting better.
And to the destruction of the Saar countries, foreign language knowledge is not measured at Pisa - in this area one could score points otherwise.
For the language of the neighbours is compulsory at gymnasia - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez replaces the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke.
According to a new law, according to the Official Journal of Venezuela, the watches are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The US-enemy Chávez founded its decision, among other things, on the fact that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time), Chávez announced the break-up of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country have to vote on on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, it would significantly increase its power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, who were concerned with the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spit in the face" with his decision, Chávez had criticised on Sunday.

A new mobile phone ringtone in the country provides for furors: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by the Spanish king Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-America summit was annoyed by the constant calls of the left-wing popoulist and had passed over his mouth.
German are in danger of wage reduction in 2007
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to be losing real wages this year.
Experts called a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, the employees could expect in real terms to be less in the pay account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is the fault of the modest wage developments, the increase in VAT and the price of food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also be imposed on employees in the case of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "Neue Osnabrück Zeitung" that the planned reduction of the unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent at the end of the year is right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not again be embarrassed to have to ask the Federal Government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products has driven inflation to the highest level in 13 years.
The total prices increased by 3.0 percent in the year-on-year period.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
In spite of its life-hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to the Earth's thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind swirls on the Poles, as they also occur on the Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have been thinking it's flashes on Venus.
Now the European "Venus Express" probe has provided proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus is shooting at a height of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature."
According to the famous "Ursoup Theory," lightning has created life on earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more dense than on Earth, and there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the Earth's devil's will, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has taken on such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the research of Venus, as since the early 1990s no more probe has been dedicated to this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, do not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the common features of our neighbouring planet with the Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa says.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which is turning much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air flows on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, will be around the sun in just under 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: a Venice day lasts 243 days of the earth.
Although the Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, is hardly reminiscent of the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
On both of them, water was gathered, which remained on the earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbon rocks, it makes up the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
Indirectly, he criticised the SPD for their attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has asked the great coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler expressed an understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balance in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel in protection from the accusation that she had a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not taken away from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that, too, "said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from among the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "window-window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellery, there were severe irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership has not only unloaded the German Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries, according to the information provided by the SPIEGEL.
China's head of government, Wen Jiabao, has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
When European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, China rejected it, and Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas have shown that he is trying to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Road battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
The Federal Minister of the Interior called for everything to be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany did not take place in the streets.
Barricades burned, randaliers shot at the police with shotguns: After the heavy youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must ensure that we do not also build up social explosives and release them into force.
We have to take this seriously, "he said to the new press in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of the social reality.
The Federal Government, the Länder and the municipalities have already worked hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, this is already the first success."
However, it was too early to be warned.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German suburbs there were no urban and sociological problems like in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had been in heavy street battles with the police in the last few nights.
There were also cars and public buildings in Toulouse.
However, the Chairman of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects."
The situation in Germany was not as difficult as in France.
However, there was still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people under 25 years of age was "above average."
In particular, more training places had to be provided.
Kolat said: "We must give the young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families."
Many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to be careful."
It was necessary to "quickly give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training."
In the meantime, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage bins and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of about 1000 security forces has provided for peace.
The police will take as long as it is necessary, Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
The night on Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured at the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were ignited by a traffic accident, in which two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The Chancellor's far-from-reality appearance documents that the coalition is in the end - and that nothing can be expected of it itself.
In which country does this Federal Chancellor actually live?
After her stunned appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wordy and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that it would have to be ruled at last.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that it is too much focused on foreign policy with a very obnoxious sentence.
That was provincial, she said, and she first showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were about.
In the Bundestag, she has clearly documented for everyone how much their accusation is.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolle presented herself: a retired politician who flees into foreign policy and even remains in the approximate.
For example, climate protection: it is unabated in its praise for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but it does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much insolence the CDU boss would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flaskle that the upswing is coming to the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than the world's beauty.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud, domestic political problems are a foothold.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low-paid?
She's got a few side sentences left for it.
It is significant how often it promises itself when it comes to the child supplement.
Three steps will take Merkel to get a half-straight sentence out.
She stumbles like on a foreign terrain when it comes to concrete.
Attack Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney make a hard exchange - and now they have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already unloaded on the first topic.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He, for his part, contends with serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a port for illegal people," says Giuliani, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism we have brought Hitler to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn as torture the so-called "waterboarding," an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated.
However, the reactions of the Saalpublik in St. Petersburg in Florida show that the important issues of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium is applauded.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, and he is asking the base and the TV audience to be one of the deputies in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the end when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civil
One day after his resignation as head of army, the Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn on Thursday for another five-year term.
The Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as head of army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus, in particular, he bowed to international pressure from the USA.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unbloody military coup, the former General now ruled for the first time as the civilian head of state.
With his resignation as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency imposed on Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his oath, Musharraf will, according to General Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus meet another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, after the imposition of the state of emergency, had occupied with him weighted lawyers at the beginning of November, had rejected all the objections last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy and four others were injured.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Krautrock Return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies again plays music: the three band members of Harmonia once again performed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival is a recording from her great time "Live 1974."
They were already much more famous abroad.
The arranged sensation then takes place in the form of three set gentlemen on the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in a white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
On the left is flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it happens to be a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The band's return to the music of Harmonia has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Here one may reveal: Targeted requests showed that the name was swirling through collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why not let the German also celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
For all that is called misleading Krautrock in England and America was always more than in their own country.
When the music industry gave the survivors of the Cologne group Can 2003 the Echo-Prize for the work of life, one saw in the hall in question German pop-faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later stared at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and of transfiguration in the foreign is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmonia because the trio existed only two years and during that time a much less power of action developed than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label held by the church.
Rother had briefly helped with the power plant and then became a guitarist with Neu!, who at that time perhaps the most radical German group, had a reputation.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians in exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-fleeting communists.
Less ideological than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plunder as a nanny.
More like being an artist.
It is said that there was also a lashes of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art.
Some of the things Harmony held on to.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe."
For so left and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The gathering of travel was not only for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record-setting of just under 50 people, as someone thinks they are.
At that time, Rother had a desire to force and practice harmonia.
For Roedelius and Moebius an unmoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric sphärian and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts."
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to the living music.
New! was already dug up like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Public subsidised, within the framework of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is here, the British, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler."
There's also the Lovereade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of the influences of the Krauttrock on the following pop music.
The space of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno hovering with the most strange sounds in the hall: "The only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmonia in the farm room.
The legend formation serves projections of further black and white photos of wire-wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again concerned with improvisation.
No more by sticking microphones to the organ and the drums to elucidate unheard sounds to the instruments of self-made effects.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth technical butchers.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern is coughed under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with "Aaaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in music schools (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Those who call here "'68!" are not quite wrong, and Harmony is not left out of it now.
The most obvious is still being thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can take your nerves off or give you a lot of luck in a few moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace" are again dealing with the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and broom, or they are too touching.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party."
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, the actor Richard Gere has now been found in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties, because too many nice and inconsequential roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have shown you the desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes a hunted one" (Why do film titles always have to be as long and confused as Lokführer collective agreements today?).
He provides a wonderfully obnoxious depiction: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been from Gere if the fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long been behind his very best times, but who has still preserved considerable remains of the former charm as a ruine monument of his decline.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" continues with the German production of "Morderische Frieden," which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, and one of them falls in love with them.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not presented here as the sole root of all evil, the TV-flat film is too quickly lost in broom and action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be seen as an example of why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters, who are starting to find the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox," could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and a different screenwriter (both in the Human Rights Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are very similar: both times small teams go to the forest to do something that the military can't do and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the fallen cynic with heart when he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to give him a romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnier who was later murdered.
"The Hunting Party" will finally go down the stream if the reporters succeed in the last five minutes in the time-lapse process in what Nato, CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have not managed in five years: to catch the war criminals and to leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague is to be called upon to commit crimes against cinema.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here, for example, they are supposed to be in agreement) not to conduct the persecution too intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
In this it is said about the wood mask of an Asian demon on the working table of the poet: "I see the swollen foreheads, suggestive: how strenuous it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly the kind of swelling heads that, however, suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
It has recently been reported in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
It is almost always true that if a star is in the world's crisis or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood DiCaprio" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out of it.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It had to be decades before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's list."
Some of the film is still going to mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" are not at all celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder in real time comes at home on two screens, even too much about the conflicts in the world.
And that's what robbing the screenwriters of the dissension that it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastically distant artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he said, "This is because some things never change.
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and war will always be in Yugoslavia. "
Proust reapes criticism for Olympic rejection
The departure of the mayor from Hamburg's application for the Olympic Summer Games has come up with strong criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games by the water.
But from Beust, realism calls for an assessment of the opportunities.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, head of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, described a renunciation as "not good for the business location."
No other project has recently developed as large a motivational force in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the sport policy momentum would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "a changed time beam."
Mayor Ole von Bust remained on Wednesday with previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said by Bust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sporbund on an application for Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, which was expected in early December.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have realistic opportunities in the time we have been thinking of until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dream for all time, said of Bust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to take a chance by burying the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploste on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application was also in contradiction with the statement of the Head of the Senate at a reception to the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.

The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD civil group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has placed on the map of Olympia and has excluded housing," said SPD Members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always called for an integrated planning for the small Grasbrook for Olympia and a later use of the home, the CDU had unilaterally set the "event factor."
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg was a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, had failed on Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Those who connect the terms Sweden and the wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At present, manufacturing wooden boxes in Sweden are throwing dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
A large part of the ninety-four listed Brillo boxes of the "Stockholm type" are forgeries.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has created doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now a sobering result: the six "Brillo boxes" which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies - and probably the majority of the around one hundred other Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" are in the international art market.
The history of the past is encircled, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes," painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard cartons of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - was made of hundreds of cardboard brillo boxes: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
These were not works of art, but their role models, but mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol was probably allowed to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968, but they were not issued in the Moderna Museet.
Time witnesses now speak of about fifteen cases, which at that time have rightly entered the art and auction history as an authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes called "type Stockholm."
Some of them have achieved more than $100 000 at auctions.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that there were about a hundred wooden boxes produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Bystrom, the chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the Swedish private-owned brillo boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first grunded and grilled, and then white oil was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, suggests that the colour was applied directly to the press panel with a paint roll without a primer - and it is not oil, but acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, saying: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copies / exhibition material."
In July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow up the "serious accusations" raised in the matter of the soap powder boxes.
But ever since then, you have been hiding in relentless silence.
Rebellion soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers have given up in a hotel in Manila and have called for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government-scattered soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly set off with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently run over to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and called for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces blocked the district around the hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who used to command the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units were about to join the march.
Government critics had called for great demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was the main site of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday night.
We now hold 20.05 percent of the share capital.
The acquisition had previously been speculated.
The option of increasing the share of Versatel is left open.
The aim is to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet announced.
Prior to that, there had already been a presumption of a start on Wednesday, after Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considered the shares to be only a third party, it was said on the financial market.
On the day before, United Internet had already taken part in the mobile company Drillisch with just under 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies have established the joint venture MSP to take over Freenet's competitors.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a share of over 10% of Freenet and do not use their right to take over another 18.49% of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
The two companies, however, remained open to all options, in particular to further increase the participation in Freenet AG, it was said.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had been concluded in mid-November.
Freenet's long-standing and difficult-to-see poker for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The holding of United Internet and Trillic has held a direct 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillic will make a further four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
