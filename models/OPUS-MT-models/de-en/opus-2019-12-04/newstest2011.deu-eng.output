What is it to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither the Voldemort nor the "confectionery."
The new council members of the capital of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Nachálně.cz has once "knocked off" members of the new council from the ČSSD, as they control the notorious slang, which has become a reality in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary, introduced by Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite in the secluded era, is derived from some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils have been showing something in the dark in relation to those new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new minister of culture, responded to the test of the "godfather vocabulary."
But the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "Golfloch."
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use every now and then."
"Otherwise I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published in this year's June in front of the ODS election congress, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously connected to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort," "the largest Prague Golfloch," "go to the confectionery," "the nude of the bull," "the treason of the capital" and "fade."
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised first to take part in the conversation, but then did not even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and how the civil democrats talk to each other, I don't judge."
"For me, how we understand each other in the context of our programmes is important," he said.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký would not have known in the above-mentioned headline that there is talk of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all, and the only term that he found correctly during the test was "the biggest Prague Golfloch."
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, but added to the security: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And it's a joke: "I'm probably going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and what it means to "go to the pastry shop."
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy company," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution, knowing that this is the seat of Janoušek's company.
In agreement with Březina, however, he adores that he has rather taken this knowledge out of the newspaper than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similar slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - salopp by his party members called "Hulda."
"At school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Councillor Weinert is the "grandpa" or less friendly of the "old man," the representative Miroslav Poche, who, before the elections, drew attention to himself by acting in party sponsorship, is called "Igráček" (well-known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues.
The nickname is the only one that the Social Democrats allow in their internal language use.
Hulínský is said to like it not to be called "Hulda," but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname, "Doctor of the Gummy Knittle Rights," has to do with Petr Hulínský's acquisition of his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
In Burkina Faso, women have a number of common social characteristics.
They are more of an older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
If one of these women "becomes a witch," she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this because they help work and give birth to children," a religious sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than one hundred women who have been expelled by their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure."
And for this reason, he published a brochure to stop the "witch pursuit."
It's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
To be accused of witchcraft is, however, also going and going in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them over with petroleum and simply lit them.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter had only been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil is flammable, which is used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "expel" an evil spirit from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" support the people here without regard for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eating human souls is a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the President of the Gambian has involved the President himself in a proper manner.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after his aunt's death, started a monstrous witch hunt, as they were supposed to have a share in their deaths and now would try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called for assistance to Shamane from near Guinea, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, took unqualified women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," said the organization Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but it also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the locked people did not survive their stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the almost thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just increased the rent as part of the so-called "deregulation."
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is to last next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 kroner.
"And there is not even hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal stove," he is angry with his finger on the new rental contract of the son, for whose signature he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-disgraced and half-resigned.
The Bürgerverein BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral," advises the tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, in which it intends to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man is just waving.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming a large "deregulatory laboratory."
After New Year's Eve, this deregulation is ahead of most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay a market-friendly rent.
As a result, Nachálně.cz decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already nine in the morning full on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards are standing at a security agency and with it a call device.
"Rent 2011," so a special touch screen will light up.
A short typed and already the device spits out a number note.
The number "157" has hardly been deciphered, and it is already beeping on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to be at all the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the Kuverts are flapping into the letter boxes with the new rental contracts to most of the 44.000 RPG's apartments.
The RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special switch for the new rent in the client center has been open since November 18.
"The action is a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies answer behind the switch after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former miners' apartments are a very difficult subject.
Before the elections, Parliament Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, who was from Ostrava, had taken up this issue quite lazily, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even a few toilet glasses they could change," the man mentioned at the beginning is getting some air.
To date, the employees have been told that pensioners are in particular at the desk to see if they really receive the promised rental discount that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December will also benefit from a half-reduced February rental.
But so far, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded with demand.
"Of the 360 clients yesterday, only about 40 to 50 of the rent was here in 2011," the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall boards where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be set by an independent court.
"This is not to be a threat, it is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"No one is going to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least part right.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which I have 5,000 for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employees will be unsure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign, and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of the rent is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the RPG Byty housing portfolio and - in the opinion of the house owners, the neglect of the housing fund, which was criticised by the proposed tenants, is the main reason for the rental increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red-shining information appears in between.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"This always means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month," can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 RPG-based apartments increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about the increase in extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square metre," RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not lead to a rapid increase in rent, but will gradually take place within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes another obligation: all the income from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the insulation.
But, as a matter of priority, these should benefit the people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-garden here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The project and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios a whole series of well-known Brno buildings came from, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopout with the premises for its company mini-child garden.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is in a position to get the project girls back to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work in a short time, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social programme.
The construction engineers have so much easier to reconcile their demanding profession and the care of children.
The mini-garden is an original idea of the staff of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they were able to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company's mini-child garden is financed by the human resources and employment policy programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's state budget.
This funding (grants of CZK 2, 8 million) has enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be purchased and for a period of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the use of the support (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini-garden for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application process.
The children take care of fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day is different over several children.
The kindergarten operation is flexible to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-kindergarten is still comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
The children do not only play here, above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, and they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What is more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and so the stress of late picking up the children from a far-away kindergarten is eliminated.
The parents therefore use their working time more productively.
It is no wonder that there is also a development of natural and loyal employer-employee relations.
In this way, Arch.Design joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits for the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their human resources marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interior of Gaudi
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn up fish mowers.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was called the "Bone House."
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of scales and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with beautiful lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
It is only when you look more closely that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and well-thought-out order.
During the night, the whole facade is even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination increases the shine of the colors.
The same swinging lines and intertwined forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wavy-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even eye holes and bars.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the conversion of a house from 1877, which was carried out by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed with Gaudí's idea of an unusual and even cheaper conversion.
The rental house Casa Batlló, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on its zipboard that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked on the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
As a result, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the Güell Park, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "Bone House."
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "gagging house."
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time being.
A little bizarre is already the 45-degree inclination.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at the time and was not in any way attached to them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the appropriate building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they asked for a remedy.
Among other things, the councillors also met with the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the city's request to do so, Josep Batlló made an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was immediately granted to him.
The house owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
By the basic elements of the change all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could comfortably chat without having to renounce a certain intimacy in more familiar conversations.
The house also received a rather unusual roof and two other floors, with the exception of a new facade.
Gaudí's game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is disguised and the light courts.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The house Casa Batlló, which was added to the World Heritage List of the Unesco in 2005, can today visit anyone.
On the first floor the most spacious and beautiful apartment is made available to the public.
The house owners decided only in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150.birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, and it was also extended to other common and the roof floor rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price for visiting the building monument is not a poplar, it is 16.50 Euro, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Those who want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with their dragon towers should try to make friends with one of the housekeepers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the bed area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
These must, however, complement each other in a harmonious way in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the health and, not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattress and rust have to be subordinate is also important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm."
In addition, they are significantly heavier than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned on a regular basis.
In fact, if they do not have enough ventilation canals in the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture is stowed: it is therefore not excluded that it forms under its mold.
In the election, of course, it also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"I think all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their closed shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (memory foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these people with diabetes who are suffering from a nervous system disorder, so that they can receive the" information "from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why I got many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer of Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco-Schaum.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it is really pounding on the warm body.
There's no pressure on it anywhere. At night, you don't walk around like you did after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When choosing the mattress size one should still add the length of the soles to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm of berths, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should be enough room for the slightly angled arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the padded master of the upholstery and room designers, who for years has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and who is also presenting this subject at specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when buying, so that the mattresses are also the same high.
There is nothing else left but to mount the rust at different heights and this is not possible for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring velvet 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be applied to the shape layer and the fine upholstery.
"You can't feel the feathers with your hand or when you sit down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
All padded beds with mattress and base like siamzwillings have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already going on and done today.
And as you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve after five to seven years.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans who promise a life of up to 25 years in mattresses, even life-long warranty.
Every thing has her if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide one should not shy the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress saver, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with round-zip fasteners today, so that you get two halves after opening (extremely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially on its own, often sounds like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get it out!
Or at the most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
In this way, they should also use the plate with ventilation holes (unless there are any) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethan mattresses do not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable latte rust with 14 to 18 spring bars (lamellen), always paying for rust with a larger latte number, i.e. 28 or more spring bars, with lordus support in the lumbar area and the possibility of regulating the latte hardness.
There are no mattresses with spring skeleton on adjustable lamellar rust, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special fastening of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed in or even to be bent in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to be reduced in a point.
Namely for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses."
It is also thought of the ladies - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For most demanding customers, point elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rust with point elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow to the right mattress and rust, most advantages are lost again.
Here too a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
A 50 x 60 cm pillow is therefore ideal, as the Scandinavian people like it.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (hay-filled) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their blends.
In the case of mattresses, the new magic word is called "organic."
Instead of oil raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used in the production of polyurethane foams - for example, castor and soy oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"For mattresses, which is the core of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent when you sleep.
Here, too, there is a difference between man and woman.
While a "cool" plant extract of birch leaves is used for men to absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate the circulation of blood, so the weaker sex becomes warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 kroner and more to pack.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT as they are considered to be medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You can see, saving on the mattress and rust is not that easy.
Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with a hidden Visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foam with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic speed.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload at the start.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in cool milieu it becomes more solid in turn.
So it perfectly adapts to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of fire, but generally increases the comfort of sleep.
However, viscoelastic foam materials are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to facilitate the legs and the vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear for one's own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them by GPS.
The system that was originally invented to search for cars can, in fact, locate people as well, which would also be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about as big as a cigarette box, but it will soon be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been afraid and scared of the case of the missing Anička, and so they look for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of the tragedy," Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there can be abuse of such devices on a case-by-case basis, for example, when you put it in someone's pocket without knowing it, but we have not had such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková points out, however, that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things on purpose if they do not want to be controlled."
"At first the mobile phones had great expectations with the parents, but they can be turned off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Mrs Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance equipment were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for it, as their sale would be certainly accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers positioning services for both automobiles and persons, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and you remain unmoved, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also do smart mobile phones with navigation, only a special software is needed.
The problem with the current locator is that it is either a matter of matching box-size devices that resemble trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There's always a danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, we are therefore testing devices that look like normal digital clocks in the present time.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or positioning device.
"Or he can only notice after some time what gives the police a time head start," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of the location function using the GPS system (as well as the GPS in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap all the Czech Republic you hold but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 km of ignition cords, with explosives being set on fire.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 km of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the company STV Group, a.s. for lupin 40 million kroner.
In his statement for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the general staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would use the 60 km ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES referred to, this statement shows that the whole army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the Army Command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of ignition belts.
This length, by the way, corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
If, however, the old rule of experts still applies that two metres of ignition cord is sufficient to train each new professional soldier, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units.
In doing so, soldiers of the fast-action Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for hand weapons, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted due to the lack of resources.
Not to mention the lack of the underdog.
"I don't know why they're buying such a lot of fuse cords from us either."
But that is their final decision, they will already know what they need. "
"For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we as a dealer would like to meet as much as possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, is the reason for the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition cord, so that the army would have covered itself with this "ammo" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year period of use of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"In the case of perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably possible," one of them admits, but he wants to remain uncalled, so as not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the service period, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not at risk to the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 km ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," Speaker Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of pyrotechnics of the police, which liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood Army, has for some years hardly exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only the quantities of these ammo that they can use before the end of the service period.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, it is also possible to keep the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable ignition cords open.
The Ministry of Defence has in any case huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred and thousands of members of the Czechoslovak People's Army were preparing for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics that MF DNES addressed, in a few years' time, the Czech forces are expecting the same problem with the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old fuse cords, which they have bought today so "cheap."
To this day, I have found the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition.
The winning position in the "Small Business of the Year" competition has helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the "Small Business of the Year" competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there is a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with a bank loan he created a building with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-semester university student at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time bothered me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back in the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open in just seven years of business in Liberec four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel."
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties have already registered at the Pytloun hotels franchise," says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"A large share of this sales for the use of hotels had just the victory in the competition" Entrepreneur of the Year, "Mr Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory has brought him greater acquaintance, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they often even congratulated me later and I must say that it was really good," he remembers.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, every sight is good.
He says that to this day he has benefited from the contacts and acquaintances that would not have happened at all.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relations."
In his opinion, the glory associated with success is also a little reflected on each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something to which general recognition is given."
I do not really see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name is just a bit in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successors a more peaceful year when we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Faremet has the worst of it, thanks to his ambition.
The prize for the first place of the Vodafone company of the year last year was received by Karel Žďárský, the owner of the company of Farmet.
The jury then appreciated the efforts he made in the small tool building in Česká Skalice to put a company out of the ground, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company's history, the effort was to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered a small workshop to his father Karel Žďárský as a compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he was employed until then break and set up with a few of his father's comrades a company of his own for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in the whole of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the mentioned competition and its medialization that it also entered into the awareness of the non-professional public.
"Not only did our customers now perceive the brand Faremet much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to attach greater value to the fact that they could work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
The last year, however, was not only the sign of the victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products.
The crisis, which at the time shook even less citizens, but mainly companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we could not escape this situation either."
"The sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even move to redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to cut down on investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and received main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel Žďárský has directed.
A public opinion survey that gives up with absurd rules
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the business competition.
Some foolish regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year's opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" the obligation to create documents to authorities available online was increased.
For example, more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the social security administration required a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have called it by two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the opinion poll.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require any excerpts from the trade register when it comes to controls on social security payers," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all the rules and orders, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to remove the insensible.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of a business competition organised by the German Economic Newspaper (HN), which is a growing public popularity.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved in comparison to the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has a 74th place in terms of business conditions, with an eight-place lower than in the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition at the end of September.
To register, the website address www.firmaranu.cz. After this, the competition organiser will select seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and will allow the public to vote on the website www.firmaranu.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz via the Internet.
It wins the absurdity that gets most votes.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105, senseless rules and orders have been notified on this year's opinion survey.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The award of the competition at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a happy event, in which personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Tsch. Republic and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Tsch. Republic at the height of the competition with the lot.
"There can be no real economic upswing where the state is throwing the business community between its legs, so it is my aim to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessarily making business more difficult today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to get out of the world's imposterous orders have been effective.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report to the business office in the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to go to an exhibition or a church with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was waived by an amendment to the Commercial Law.
The obligation to have the second largest number of votes received in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office for a period of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card."
And - all good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was chosen, which imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the office room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the requirement for a refrigerator was abolished.
A new category pays tribute to socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010."
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support those companies that are aware of the consequences of your business activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, who is the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebel of the Year."
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon company of the year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal were registered.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and would be enough material for a self-contained article.
Although they are diametrically different in terms of the subject-matter of their activities, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about people who have been dealt with, because they are dealing with personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the development of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for the children of the past seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes good care of its health-related workers, which account for 70 percent of their workforce, for which it was awarded the title "responsible company of the region of Central Bohemia"; in the Vodafone company of the year competition, it took third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which, among other things, introduced a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without any relative wage reduction.
At the title ceremony, the jury also awarded the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
In turn, the responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is located in the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and it also promotes home work in its employees and in company actions it uses carting services provided by a home-protected workshop.
"We also support the" People in Need "Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy region, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
"We give our employees contributions to the food, work, increase their qualifications and leave," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the Vodafon company of the year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire accompanying the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition" responsible company of the year, "but they were not disqualified in the main competition Vodafone company of the year."
"A separate registration only to this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrest of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Bodenfonds in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have been taking arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
The latter had allegedly tried to manipulate a recent public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition was to a specific interested party.
This is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At that time, I can only confirm that the police are following a person for the crime of fraudulent actions in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo," could not provide further details on the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police.
The way in which he could manipulate public competition, it is only possible to speculate about it in the light of the sparse official information.
The spokesperson for the Land Fund Lubomír Černá referred to the question of Právo that the police had actually taken arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Land Fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concrete.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct name "invitation to tender of land transfer rights under the Land Law 'and would take place in cases where several applicants have an interest in the land offered.
"These persons shall, in the context of the request, offer a higher value of their rights of restitution to be settled by the transfer than the value of the land called."
"In accordance with the offered claims, the order of the potential acquirers is defined, then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. was obviously available information on who had signed up to the request and as he was a legitimate person because he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered to a property interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
It's obviously against a fat settlement.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Land Fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement institutions for which the site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. of the Land Fund also purchased land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the point where the construction of the access magistrals to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later, he exchanged these very conveniently with the magistrate against a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to give little heart to the small ones in order not to endanger the construction of the building by blocking the land.
Households' housing costs increase by a few hundred per month
As of January, households will have to expect not only higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste water charges, and for district heating and some places, rents will also grow.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns a month more out of the wallet than before.
Electricity will be more expensive up to 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also the district heat supplies will be more expensive.
The electricity system alone costs the households a few hundred more kroner a year.
Strong electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, so it is due to the significant support for electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic plants.
While gas is only moderately more expensive, it is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, we can expect a few hundred more kroner per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
In particular, larger places are planning to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 kroner more per month for district heating, more than 1000 kroner more per year for families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are threatened with 9% higher water and waste water charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, remains one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In the North of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental price increases can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will be abolished from January.
For example, the CPI Byty housing company, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rent by a hundred percent from January.
If you do not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants to question it in court.
The regulated rent, which is still being paid in approximately 300,000 apartments, is expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with ferret and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once a good whiskey that was stolen from the house bar from the father.
These are the drinks, after which drunk Czech teenagers under the age of 15 have to be treated most often.
No exception are children who have to sleep out their hangover again in the hospital.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the intake of the children's departments of hospitals.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the children's department in the Central Bohemian hospital of Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it is possible to steal a bottle from the house bar from the father, and if it is not, then at least Zeret or Vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokesperson of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová is right.
"The most common thing is about Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's drinking trend, especially at primary schools."
"In a single way, it was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," said Mrs Jurinová.
According to Pelikán, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers in the hospital are no exception.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has been working for ten years in the Paediatrics Department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulance provided drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first given 3.5% alcohol in the blood and also in combination with" Extase, "the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at some dance party at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't think it was strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when they touch their own sprouts that is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence in the true sense of the word in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and that is not the case with these children."
For those who enjoy repeatedly alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic, "explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to Mrs Jurinová, the spokesperson of the Motol hospital, about forty drunken children were admitted to the local department for children's and youth medicine until mid-November.
However, only those cases with severe alcohol poisoning which required a hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home by parents or, where appropriate, by the police after outpatient treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children drink only one bottle of liquor in the school bank, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes to which one hundred percent is left: Walpurgis night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of sorrow or because of the bad witness or because of the joy of the holiday."
"On the night of the Walpurgis I have already experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who has only to fight with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning after that, due to dehydration and the lack of glucose, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the" wonderful "experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without something hurting anywhere."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, with at least at least the result of which he disgruntled the patients by telling them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed are good and happy to be on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Once in a while, I used this as a means of education if I had directly charged the children on the visit what their drunkness cost and that it could well happen that they have to work over the whole holiday to earn the money for a single party like this," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not use regulatory procedures to claim the costs of the parents to cure the drunken children.
Two L-159 training aircraft for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has replaced against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
They have so far only been seen abroad in manoeuvres or air shows.
This is about the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
When she is physically expediting the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The one-seat L-159 aircraft, in turn, were separated from long-term aircraft, without any further deposits and investments from the Ministry's department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were replaced in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four redundant L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, and the second one wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to force the aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty clearly states that the company EADS is a customer of L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to train pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is therefore a matter for the customer, in which way he realises the matter," Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender procedure for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The then defence office argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero, of which only 24 were used, and the rest was sold.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a judicial follow-up.
The European Commission is referring the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last one is to land in the airport of Kbely within 14 days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at less risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stress, added Mrs Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the right-hand index finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability was for prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were equal in length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent and in men up to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already formed at prenatal age, clearly reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech genetician and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was known to him in a fugitive way, but he did not consider the relationship between the length of his fingers and the risk of cancer to be "completely proven."
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walking trails there is mostly fixed snow, the winter workers were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents from trucks and cars and the D1 at Brno is "standing" in the direction of Prague.
This was said by Novinky.CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At km 91, a truck died, at km 93, two trucks collapsed, and in this accident, there were injured.
There are also a few cars in the street.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two trucks have come together.
The drivers should leave right behind Brno at km 190 or go over Brno and take the Kývalka at km 182.
This is where there is a million-long congestion.
An accident has also happened on the D11, and this is right on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a several centimeters thick snow ceiling and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons form, for example, in the Prosek district, the Štěrboholská street is completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is definitely the Metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlplatz and Peaceplace.
At 8: 00 in the morning, the Prague crisis team will meet.
There are also problems with the railway and the airfield.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun route.
It is important for travellers to find out about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11: 00 at night until 5: 00 in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
In the area around Vyškov three side roads are completely immobile, in the area of Brno there are some snowy spots and in the area of Blansko one is forced to use snow-milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three roads completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow milling.
When they become accessible again, it is not possible to estimate so far.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the streets, which for nature reasons can only be scattered with inert sprinklers, is one up to five centimeters thick snow cover, ČTK led.
In the Czech Republic, new snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most of it in North Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slow to stop snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon."
The American troops have for the first time used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is only known to date under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the power ratio in their favour.
The new weapon is like a super-accurate gun.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a meeting safety of only a few meters.
The special bullets of 25 mm caliber, which were designed for this gun and contain high-explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the time of impact on the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
In other words, it can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trenches.
It is not usually protected from the top, so the murderous steel shredding rain from the top can easily put him out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new battle gun is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is basically doing this: he is targeting the target and sending out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins an exact point of vision after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to press it off.
"Let's say you've measured a mile."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun will charge up and shoot the gun at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs being moved
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Street in the district of Niederrad in Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which had so far been distributed across the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in Astro Park would be better suited to the working of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had only been tenants.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport was particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurt business secretary Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was once again a "global player."
That was a "great site commitment."
Fujitsu is a city in the district of Kaupu in the district of Kaupu in the district of Kaupu in the district of Kaupu in the district of Kaupu in the district of Kaupu in the district of Kaupu
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed by the management of the intention.
"We have, of course, offered the company our help," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts, however, could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house at the town hall square and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most controversial construction projects of the Kurstadt with the other buildings at the Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city hall was created between the station and the city hall, which was critical of the massive construction of the previously used areas as a parking lot as well as the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and credit rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens, purchased the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based German Real Estate-Opportunities Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu conuzier is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees include Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, and the other subsidiaries at this site are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, the office building Astro Park rented 7000 square meters.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name refers to its star-shaped layout - the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Industries has its seat, among other things.
Amazon locks servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
It may be political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
It is said that the Wikileaks founder Assange is in England.
The Wikileaks Discovering Platform is getting more and more under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search lists, is supposed to be in the UK after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks of Amazon-Server is displaced."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free," the unveiling activists informed Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
A short time ago, the Internet company Amazon had banished the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to release the secret diplomatic debits in order to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks further said: "Great - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon had stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman had done research, the television station CNN reported on the Lieberman office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian."
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for the platform to be denied use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and ruthless action puts our national security at risk and endangers all around the world," it is called in a communication from the non-partisan senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being sought for rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on the search list of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK that the exact place is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is right about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations to be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, a consultant from head of government Stephen Harper said - apparently ironic - on TV, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
The White House and the Assange were in the meantime replaced by a fight.
American President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The American government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
The White House was appointed as Special Representative by the Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which had become necessary after the disclosure of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that it would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if they were to be put in danger by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that is necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest supply and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From the gelataio and the gelataio.
The gelatiere, in German some ancient ice confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooling counter with a spatula, throws it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you will not pass the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-cream university set up the manufacturer of ice-cream machines in 2003, so that the ice-cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest supply and visitors from all over the world.
There are also several-day special courses for chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream shop.
Some of them dream of a new career in the Midlife Crisis, others just dare to get on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, California's art teacher, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to fill in something of her own after years in a annoying job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive thing is not only good taste, but also the silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the little cream of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romance in it."
The first step to production seems very simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heat everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cool it down to four degrees.
Then he turns a rooster on the machine and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all the milk-ice varieties.
The teacher is immediately being warmed with questions: can you only make ice cream with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one let one's own experiential pleasure go free?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the time.
Those who speak of ice cream "only of natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it is in itself, and the customer bites on all the ice.
Some variations on the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of aromatised additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit orbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the ice cream from the white base mass, which with eggs becomes the yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice-cream machines.
Luciano makes them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla and other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subject to the fruit varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture would raise the taste of a gelato properly, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream an extra portion of sugar is required.
Luciano draws out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (with this, the wine-growers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make the billing easier.
Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical use as it used to be.
Not only the device helps for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small breakdowns do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo is stunned with fruit puree and his group of course from top to bottom, when the oversized stab mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before such a thing happens."
Controllers in the twilight
The European Food Authority, Efsa, had been infiltrated by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This is the case now by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech chief Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years with the Lobby Association Ilsi.
It is paid by companies like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper had worked significantly on the Efsa test rules for gene plants and was thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The Efsa rules are in the same terms as the position papers of the Ilsi and thus the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the Italian authority in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech is complaining of a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-level Efsa manager recently without any conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and had thus changed the pages.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) has also recently revealed personal links between the EU's controlling authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as the EU's parliamentarians a little more sensitive.
However, the Efsa cannot identify any conflict of interest.
It is said in a statement that all serious data, including those of industry, are used as long as they are of high technical quality.
The experts who work for Efsa do not demand that they have no contact with the industry.
But you have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This is called itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobbying order.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently being approved in animals without any feeding test and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize is doing in the field," says Then.
Today's practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" Then is accusing.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck thinks.
The scientist has been research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There were therefore hardly any researchers who were not intertwined with companies.
In general, critical studies for companies would not be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell was also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday night he stood in front of the Stuttgart station, the Tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September the excavators had moved and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands of people demonstrated against S21, the million-heavy depth of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in debris.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim shell lime, a soft rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't leave."
He warmed: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he saw one, he smelled like a cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the brooks yet.
Stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all the people who came up at the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be ground to gravel or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden book that once was a watchhouse.
He said that he was being insulted and threatened when he was in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he was talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he can't do anything for the demolition.
And if it is done, then it is the most reasonable thing to do if the stones are used further.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos on average, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest is already sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, house owner.
They had come from everywhere and had dragged away what trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long been transformed into "mäerle" or into limits of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He's getting in his off-road car, taking a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
In law he studied and abandoned, later biology, then he was interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He's storing 40000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany, he's carting his treasures together.
He says he's the largest old-stone dealer in the Republic.
It's braking.
In the snow are artfully haired sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he's hot.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the road through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
Go on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The quader once belonged to the stand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what trouble, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple flask and ochsenkarren, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if you were to put such a thing at risk."
He didn't get rich, he didn't get rich.
But 14 people today are employed by the stone dealer, and also have settled up in the forest of stone buttocks, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the rest.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high-potential
There's a lot of rush at the buffet.
16 students are pushing for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the machine and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are to work with VW developers on the car of the future - and to get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are now in the close-up fight and, such as VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditorium as early as possible before they enter the labour market and are rerecruited by others.
And because the universities do not issue any information on the performance of their students, one tries to see and tie the exception values in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is advertising for the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internships and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweig is responsible for the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as employees."
Such cooperation, said Selle, is not unusual.
It is new that so offensive for the students is being humbled.
"Otherwise, the focus was rather on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the newly educated is going to get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
But they have to pay prices and, in particular, to increase the number of highly qualified workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineering gap will be even greater.
For the audit and consulting company KPMG Roman Dykta is going on the talent hunt.
It organises complex recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which the participants have to find their way on the basis of GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight promising students across the US next year.
By the way, the participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to join will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates flies to the USA.
The high potential of the universities is growing, according to Dykta, when the guns are being hauled and stung.
"We want to stand out of the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta seems to be paying the bill.
"We have been in contact with all the participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct walking on the campus, small and medium-sized companies also go on the Pirsch in a very classic way at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"For example on the Intersolar," reports Sisha Stübe, head of staff at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs about 1500 people in Germany.
There's a lot of evidence about young people's problems.
At the moment, 35 posts are on the company website.
"It's very difficult to occupy vacant positions right now."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
SolarWorld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that we can do internships or write their thesis."
Expensive promotions are not called for by the solar specialist.
The company is trying to promote it with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"A large company often cannot offer this," says Stübe, head of staff.
Money is no longer the lead in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other key factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, SolarWorld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also add points to the job-seekers.
"I think that applicants are particularly looking for external assessments of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through its own employees," he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer is called branding, that is, the employer's mark formation within the own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would be on their own with friends and acquaintances for their employer.
"It's like a game with a gang," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington has issued a ban on this - and has thus definitively revoked its previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drilling is prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster, which cost 11 workers and led to the United States's biggest environmental disaster, President Barack Obama, at the pressure of the opposition and industry, had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the US's dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who are responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been finally resolved.
The focus of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A Commission of Inquiry on behalf of Obama is to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the post-explosion drilling stop.
A number of oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stronger controls and stricter security rules, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which had been discredited after many allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that it will close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of support in the Gulf would be significantly lower than in the past by more stringent regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the BDO consultant - even before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
Investment in new support projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of raw oil spilled have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't take off," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You will still get enough oil mud before the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to expose a boy who wakes to the chest in the water with the loops surrounding him: in the rainbow-coloured water gloss the scene looks almost beautiful.
The fact that brown crude oil seines are floating under the surface is not to be seen.
In the past, she used to collect prawns here, Esther Badom tells us on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty river.
In the meantime, the sluggish flowing waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, from a borrowed pipeline, a lot of crude oil was poured into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishing waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Nigerian delta, is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
During the journey through the mangrove swamps through the river runs, the whole extent of the sizing becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the engine boat rushes brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, draws out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees stand out of the ground like black licorice bars, sad leave occasionally touching palm trees hanging their weidel.
Bird's heat, as is usual in wetlands, is found in vain: as soon as the outborder is silent, the former paradise, which smells like a gas station, spreads into a spooky calm.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari dark: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe arrived, here, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistance, the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil worker.
Today, the company is still not allowed to return to Ogoniland: while from the entire Deltato region of the triple size of Switzerland with over 5000 drilling sources and 7000 km of pipelines are pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable.
Every few hundred meters of steel-shaped frames like bizarre sculptures out of the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the holes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant current of crude oil rushes into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have entered the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that went into the sea in front of Alaska in the wake of the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker's accident 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Those who are responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be denied.
While the Shell Group is responsible for sabotage and organised oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell established significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner presented to the group in 2008: "The rate of defects on the lines alone is a lot higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-coated workshop under the open sky, the mangroves show up: they are splinter-naked and are oil-sponged to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, some of which are arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire is flickering: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the receiving head, later drips out at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still lower the price of the diesel with just under 40 euro cents per litre: they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland. In this way, according to experts, the country is lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil a day throughout the Nigeria delta.
However, only a disappearing small part of the temporary intermediate raw material is processed illegally: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, are filled in tankers and are being shipped to the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is more likely to be due to the transformations of the population or the lax way of production, the activist Akpobari considers it to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the relationship between the Ogoni and Shell was so destroyed that only one of the group's withdrawals would be possible: "Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's high time you left," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the armed forces' special unit, they will not be arrested, but they will have a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the country's north, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction vehicles in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a big security problem.
In the investigation of an emergency-landing machine, investigators have discovered a possible construction engineer, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landing Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November seem to have had much more luck than before: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in its investigation in the engines of some A380 machines - and now warns against a possible construction contractor.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil tubing compound, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in an opinion published by the ATSB Authority on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure."
Rolls-Royce's engines were affected in 20 A380-series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It submitted a statement of grounds to an Australian federal court in Sydney, which would allow it to take further legal measures against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said that his airline would require compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine, parts had dissolved and the support areas had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem had been considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its 11 A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa changed the engine for an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey plane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Land-wide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Snow has fallen over night almost all over the country.
There are chaos, trains and flights on many roads.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic is snowing at night on Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east are some 15 centimeters thick snow ceilings.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new-burning snow.
In addition, strong gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expected to be on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holsteins from the morning on storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal level.
In Saxony, the snow spills on the highways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the weather-central meteocesdia, in Saxon Switzerland, the highest level was therefore a violet level of alarm - the highest level ever.
In part, there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused damage.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to traffic and traffic congestion.
In Thuringia, the snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, cut trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and crossings are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by fire-fighters and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
A number of cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a speaker at the flight information centre.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers were at the airport, there would still be almost 400 field beds available for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred due to snow-covered roads: here too a truck was recorded on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver was killed.
On the train four passengers were injured - the line from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had overlaid herself with her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
But the meteorologists have good news: While the snow will still be loose and powdered and will therefore be stirring up with light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is haunted by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Just now, Deutsche Bank has made its Group headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now the financial group seems to want to get the cost of the renovation out again - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise houses, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes by reference to a speaker.
The reason for the planned sale was not mentioned by the speaker.
"We always check whether it is more useful to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institution will return its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a private fund and then had been thoroughly renovated.
The energy conversion was a waste of about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to industry experts, the value of the now renamed "Greentowers" towers in the newspaper is estimated at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands of mourns for dead buddies
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the crash shaft is still precarious.
Just under two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth had a violent explosion.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Now members and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island in the light of the sun.
They kept silent for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners there were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies were to be seen.
Also pictures and personal objects, including clothing and surfboards, found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners "from the depths of the earth" would come back to the surface, said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants in the memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not close with the death of his son until he saw his body, said Lawrence Drew, whose son Zen was spilled in the pit.
In addition to the prime minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin had also been spilled.
Lifetime workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were displaced, it was started to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does splinter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn remodels old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising."
Which audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A caught Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torments and, with almost superhuman forces, reacts his opponents in a row - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabies of killing methods and to tear his enemies out of the living body once he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as it is actually called, says the whole film about no word, and the other characters can be carried out at most one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise it is kept silent and swollen in the creepy beautiful hills of Scotland, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the backdrop.
Ideal for adult cineasts with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Nice, if a film has several target groups, it's only a pity if they're excluding each other.
Since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," director Winding Refn is considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream or to the arthouse with a little more humour.
Most of the art cinema friends are likely to be discouraged by the spurring brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest, when, for free-to-interpret reasons, the eyes of a group of violent Christian missionaries are breaking up by ship to Jerusalem, and are stuck in the air and fog for an eternity before the team appears to arrive in America and continue to remain silent.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a shame, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the magnificent to blood-driven facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a strong action, it is all the atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly seizes his throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unfathomable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy, who is loyal to one's eyes, is keeping something like innocence, and all the others are being driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly an ambassador of the devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for those who are already dead.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, stir and wonder.
An experience.
Mysterious work on the earth
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this - it still allows for controls.
Around midnight from September 5 to September 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 km away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has allegedly built in the quader with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that is off the current.
According to a letter from the U.S. foreign secret service CIA from late April 2008, the reactor, which was also used under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the '50s is hardly good.
The CIA performed a video presentation with unsharp satellite images.
By computer animation, she blinded where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos that show the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the commissioning, it was said, but not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little is known more than at the time, and the riddles were more likely to grow over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, before the attack, the CIA was quite certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but there was little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapon program" in the country.
Some of Europe's secret service workers prefer to be even more careful and speak only of a "supposed reactor," even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer only replied lapidar that the IAEA "had enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians quickly removed the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, through a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial operators from the period immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always said that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium is from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But this was rejected by the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also prevents the inspectors from having a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
As a result, the investigation of the case has been taking place since June 2008 and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the Authority," as a high-level Western diplomat at at at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area over which the IAEA is watching.
The key to progress in the field of education seems to be three other facilities that are to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and in contrast to the one that still exist.
The inspectors have so far not disclosed the installations they are, nor the function they have or what makes them seem suspicious.
According to the information provided by the Southern German newspaper, they are internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and identified a building complex on satellite images at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - it is precisely with this justification that Syria is preventing the IAEA from accessing the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent forward by the US to scout military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported between the three places and the quader at the Euphrates.
A high-level Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
There were, however, "no indications of sensitive activities," i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be cut off later, there are at least plausible conjectures on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could provide valuable traces, were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information on where the debris has remained.
A few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, the Salmine al-Tibni, which in 1998 examined Syria for its suitability as a warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently associated them with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from the orbit show that Syria was doing earth work in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interests of the inspectors are.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna complained a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter was not very urgent, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting in place so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it takes a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and on the other, some of the 35 countries represented there are far from ready for escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless lead debut in the summer, there is trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, is persistent in falling in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
In the meantime, the film is in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN Refugee Fund UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is himself an ambassador of the UN Refugee Fund.
It is not diplomatic - it has offered women a meeting weeks ago in Hungary, but it has rejected it.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims is enough to tell her about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Fund, her organization recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her script to read, has granted a filming permit for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author herself admits that she has no political intentions with her film, has worked hard into the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vague about the content.
So a second synopsis to the film on the net curates, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds a lot different than the "rape victims fall in love with torture."
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now, I think only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: by putting the script, as many have done before, illegally on the web.
Let's get out of here.
This evening it's finally going really round for the Irish.
No sign of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans yell for joy with a raging loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in the south of Ireland is shaking because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro victory premium plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the World Bierpong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shaky drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself to distract himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a game fun in Las Vegas, he will be in New Zealand in January.
"I have a feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerked, she had her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already been looking for their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, say experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are kept in mind, there is a wave of emigration similar to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, Tristesse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly unsure of the young, well-trained Irish, for whom it has only been up to now.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
But now three out of ten women and men under thirty are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are letters of readers of young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes down in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but those who can go away and our country is losing a whole generation."
"The last one will turn out the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future as the government is only making an eye-wielding and not offering the young people any future prospects.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She's watching her classmates go from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years' time.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon try to fill the subject in a positive way.
McLarnon is organising the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a trade fair that offers a round-the-table service on working abroad.
"For start-ups, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known how it feels to build something else for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're pulling up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan only rarely sees his home, because he makes extra shifts in order to be able to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he first steps over the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a little bit embarrassed and goes through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-maintained front gardens, in the driveways large, expensive cars park.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for €380,000 for four years ago - 100 percent credit-financed.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that the loan might go wrong?
O'Donovan is thinking for a while, drinking hot tea and saying, "I don't have any children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer doesn't like the wailing he's heard a lot at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it'll make us feel Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just see how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London he has already been behind him and why should it not go well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
But one thing is still there, which in these days is his concern: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it could be a good-bye party.
"Don't get too many emotions," he says and drinks a big sip of his beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walk-away party, easy, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democatrical Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly in the eye of this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased considerably (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing by around 6% a year since 2002, the number of advocates of democracy has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico too, where the economy has recovered since the strong fall in last year, such a trend can be seen.
But only half of the people in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts for more democracy.
This continued during the world economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America have only experienced a short period of recession and have quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social net.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% this year.)
But there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more marked and violent crimes have increased.
It is only for the second time since the start of the survey that many people in Latin America have seen a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the private and market markets: around 71% of the respondents reported that the private sector is essential for development, and in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The people in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the US as the most influential country, with this role being taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An election doll.
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the election helpers who hurried to help the troubled country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes, ballot cards in the ringstone, destroyed ballot places and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Electoral facilities opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, were in search of a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top riders, called for the lifting of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There have been some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "quite good in many respects."
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is supposed to be committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected final selection is scheduled for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former first-lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support from the voters, has declared the election to be the winner of the final vote, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitians were prevented by a lack of organisation at the vote.
Shortly before the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are in the same opinion.
Heavenly in the middle
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, which is the highest since her election in 2007.
However, whether you will make this a re-election next year depends on whether the clearly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromise-prepared than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife's election, often set up budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president couple to spend the extra revenue on their own initiative.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disgust.
Some of the regime critics from the ruling perists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian struck another in the face and others accused the government of bribery) the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget now also applies for the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money on his own initiative.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - have a value of almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction his main objectives, not the inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute for Statistics and Census, which then enjoyed official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth surge by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina with the rest of the world in financial terms.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris Club funders, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is the case elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister for Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the production of a new national consumer price index, and it looks as if this is the first step towards the cleaning up of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after her term of office.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of the Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holiday in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to her will be turned off.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to lift many of her husband's political decisions quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all those entitled to vote, came to vote in the five districts of the city of Mayor and Councillors, which is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building a groundbreaking business relationship, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of the relationship with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only close.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which supports a greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the vote of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved in with the KMT to the city councillors.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoy with rifles, flag-swinging mass removals and only sparsely clothed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
Bizarrereweiser is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a fight with the candidate.
The attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which the KMT has given more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
It is remarkable that relations with the mainland have not been addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like to focus its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also avoided to stir up the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese people are in favour of China's policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wishes for political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was very weak: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly in favour of absolute independence.
But under Tai's regency a new generation of fated politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the professional and the youth.
As the DPP's presidential candidate, Tsai found a lot of support, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, requires non-prejudicial discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's advance approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scissors between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of a reapproach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese people see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no going back."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you show up at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a little unusual, but it is in accordance with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at most three albums before the release of the album with which he became known in the general public.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And with her insidious voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can still compare Spalding with Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination of Spalding comes closest.
In addition, the album "History" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrument albums. This favorite of the critics had a huge success.
The Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough-legged favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBOs "Treme," was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, in which other albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are more likely to be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of large group. He thus takes up the Billy Children Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is presented by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to South California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles." This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mellinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hates "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" of the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; and Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestra performance for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Ackx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Classic Crossover category, soprano Jessie Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local rules and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice is true."
"There are few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The meeting began at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to the press-enterprise.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," was a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is over."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud called Harmush to be non-violent.
His community with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new Mediterranean-style mosque, about 2,300 m2, should have two minarets and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered necessary.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which is published on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake is growing even further, even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"The question is what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, Anbar says.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms can start biochemical processes in other planetary systems with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily defined," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
As arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes exposed to both may replace one element with the other.
"The poison of the arsenic is mainly based on the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system, where it almost all smears," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early years of the world, she says, so science has assumed that it has used early life forms.
"This gives reason to believe that life can have developed differently than in the early age of the earth," Forster said, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when the unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, said the government statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday night, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are well," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide details of the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say more about this," explains Whitmore.
"We're following a few tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a Downey district ski resort.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to take part in the competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should take part in other competitions on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-headed Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6: 00.
Peek promised anyone who could give an indication of the Corgis a finder's wage. The animals were implanted in microchips for identification.
On Thursday it has not yet been established whether a finder's wage is paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "prepare" scheme to repay the debt of $5 billion and open the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and television shows.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the relaunch of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be the main manager of the studio.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, is running the company.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order of the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, who fought with interest payments of $300 million per year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the managing director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the financial concerns of MGMs and to pay out the studio's more than 140 genders took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all started from the beginning, when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million
Barber and Birnbaum plan to re-record the production at MGM. This year, the studio produced only one film and produced an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in the early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
But the last negotiations between the two companies did not result in any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can tear a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although there are fewer new toys with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most famous of these kinds, web cinema and club penguin.
More and more button-cell-powered toys are coming on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all the prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children over 3 years of age) are plush figures, as large as guinea pigs, who sing a note when you press on their belly.
Once you press a note, you can play a song by pressing several times.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of healthy and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2 and above) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interacting games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with wheel blocking it dominates the moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80's, you must remember Alphie, one of the first computer learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a better-known with a car correction function as a teacher.
If you do not want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qworth keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as the ones on the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12), which, according to Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series, is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8 and up). The five blocks are no bigger than a match box and have a own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, the most important are web cinema and club penguin.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match figure package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
They can be roller shoes or a puffle fabric animal.
The latest head cell-operated microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle quickly moves on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of monasteries.
And he can take a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are becoming softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and a damped voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing out of the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped loops.
"They look like an average to me," Mr Tang says.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new candidates must have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-stare: In 2009, 50 officials reported to have circled an unproperly set-up car and stared at the operator until it packed in and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a district of Chengdu with a population of 650,000, wants to change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police strip. They have been selected for their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
I want you to give the rough-ass police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
It's right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his phone, beating down a protest action against a dump.
Last year, a training manual of the Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how offenders can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A video game of violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on road dealers.
"Chengguan is scaring the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough cleaning."
Skeptics find the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job announcement, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figures and "harmonious faces."
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to the officials, the work is too physical for women over 25.
"The most important is their image," an unnamed district official said at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the female candidates get the job first depends on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "but beyond that they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's municipal administration, does not want to agree to this description,
However, it was admitted that in China, the size of job ads for both sexes is not unusual.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is a good look is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical dispositions do not need to apply.
"We cannot, unfortunately, use any lame or boulder here," said Mr Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bakes and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel sexist that so much value was placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Your colleague with the dimples, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short-term attitude, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply to shy traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the strip deals with about 12 street dealers who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before being chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his noodle kitchen on a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous than strenuous.
"It's the same thing almost every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who is studying sales in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the dealers, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public enemies that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, were rounding after the rumor that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown over or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such acts of violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, contrary to the regulations.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials took their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male stripe coordinator, remained behind, turning his white name sign around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"But sometimes also physically," explains Mr. Li sober.
"Most of the time people start fighting."
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges that were raised against him after his affair with a former election officer and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying activity, the lawyers of the senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which provided headlines throughout the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "very pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary sentence.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were closed and that there were no further charges on this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had failed to respect the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election helpers, helped to buy lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website * Official website
Ensign made contact with some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogation, he took over for them after the attitude of Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to do any lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the Affaire, was contrary to the so-called ban on the shooting-door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be an agreement and a violation of the revolving door statutes," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients who are in the government's interest.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethic lawyers said that the Ministry seemed very careful in taking political charges after a large number of defeats that the media had followed with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" Association (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to justice.
"In principle, this means that high-level government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a public prosecutor on Monday and another one the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry would not raise complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I am not comfortable with going into the details of the discussion between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: we believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation into a separate case by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had violated the Federal Electoral Act.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, after the company has moved Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he "knocked" at the Ministry of the Interior for a thing.
Mr. Ensign was also appointed to lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had hired for lobbying.
When last year, for the first time, information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he was fourth in the ranking of the Republicans.
After he had not noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he wanted a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press officer, Jennifer Cooper, the senator, said that the ethics commission very quickly follows the example of the Ministry of Justice and closed his investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work at the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calling draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped off in the riots in the courtroom.
In a minute's time, they sent their reports about the cruel testimony on Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of rape and beds-chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will end officially when the verdict of the jury is made.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already submitted applications to the court, which state the reasons for an appeal and which the courts will employ for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has led to a "circus atmosphere" and so widespread, immediate penetration of robustle details, so that the jury has been inadequately influenced by public indignation.
This opposition could lead the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies would make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have seen during this process, I believe it is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom will affect the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The ruling judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected the requests by decision last week, saying that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court objections have found that reporting on famous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court objections, which Mr. Haye's conviction is about half a century later, could be followed by the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication channels from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes that are being persecuted by a general public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is being arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts may be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes more fair.
The Twitter issue is only one of many that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes set out to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel crime scene photos during the selection of judges.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their daughter, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a lawyer who was a critic of the prosecutor's office and that he had put undue pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a judgment they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the Governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions over the case.
"Such a daily urge of the media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "you have not seen before in New Haven and perhaps even country-wide."
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more arduous than reports that are being reported more slowly is a technologically hostile view that is impoverishing the coverage of future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeals courts are often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes are required by the courts to adapt.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers are strengthening this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the sentence of Dr. Sheppard was lifted on the basis of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separator?
After a campaign of pitiful words and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not lead to a breakthrough in the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions are taken.
After all that you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party score.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months will create a mutual respect that will cover the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to say that there has been a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is called for, while one is trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere, which has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the Washington November election was at least mild for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise party passions that die again.
And that's good. "
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, be it temporary or permanent.
A compromise on the increased unemployment benefits is also to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, the optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the new START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insituation warns that a successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 121st Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-agreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that coziness leads to true cooperation.
"I see much of what is happening from today to 2012, as a pre-match, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who used their education.
However concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are poking too high, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and to overtake health reform.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the EDP, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as increasing the retirement age and reducing public spending.
The Vice-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are very much fighting to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when the Republicans challenge Obama in terms of the state budget, taxes and the health system, followed later by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the party nature of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may, in fact, be an optimistic view.
Party and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure foreplay for a much wider 2012 election.
In this way, the courtesy that is being shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that still separate them from each other.
Leeked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it gives part of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. In February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service are blackmailing high protection money to keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the leaders move up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime it would have been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected over years of allegations of corruption and has won numerous slander claims against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentary that suggests he is corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as is the case in the Ambassador's report, individual persons are called, and it is not heard that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it" disturbed, "and to conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government," said the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection), which extends through the police, state security (FSB), the MVD and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, the criminal and the criminal inspectors at the lowest level follow."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas fill a gap because the city does not provide any help."
The report also says that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small business people.
A source, it is said, "said Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer the same as it used to be."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest no; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - due to one or the other preoccupation.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time he has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, Director of Dirt, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
In fact, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks in place 154 of a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-state organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memos of the American Embassy, which happened later after Moscow, will certainly cause maladministration within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and turning walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge high castle in the north-west of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, many long-standing supporters are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to face the public with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time told children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs increased, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chang Youk, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that the regime is researching.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It's splitting up families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, reversion or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government fell in 1979, the regime's remains and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
This was where they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok attracted the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run over to the government, leading to the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the murmuring poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring to justice Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has not helped to alleviate the fears of Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation have focused on In the Chaem, 64 years, who had been district leader in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told representatives of the documentation centre of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project in which thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening, the Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the withered grass, In the Chaem, it refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had to invite her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
In addition, Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has repeatedly warned against the situation being insecure, the court would charge more suspects, even though experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chang Youk from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means intermingling the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that everything can understand."
The center created the first school book on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia," approved by the government.
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the high school of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book will help students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the judgment," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are sentenced by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence, "he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a way overgrown by shrubs and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pol's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire pile.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone store on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will take a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to collect non-weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's global nuclear material security campaign, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer be able to collect high-enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had for years tried to convince Belarus to collect no longer highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research institution.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important and important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all the precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has stated that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-able, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, say official.
It was loaded into a special train that more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official.
The second approach was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the official.
The US government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flowing into Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Centre for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-capable uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to disarm its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over the Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as is shown by a telegram from the Ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents provided by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily "El País" (cable). It is added that the former Deputy Head of Government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish Government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, which charged the aid for human rights violations in a duet country, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega, discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "had met Zapatero in the far away" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objections to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed," to avoid being "unprepared to be surprised," reports Aguirre by cable.
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish Government "did not want to pay much attention to this matter, even though the government had little influence as they were in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor, Vicente González, in turn, gave the message in January 2007 to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the de-classification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence via the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," said the Ambassador after a conversation with the Public Prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the disclassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discrete management between governments," Aguirre laments.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the US Ambassador and the Spanish Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, took part, the latter commented that "even though the Spanish judges were very much concerned about their independence and did what they thought was appropriate," he had given his staff instructions to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments in order to let the tension go away."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern at the action taken by the PP on this matter.
"In spite of its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, from a statement that the government of Zapatero, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will have been tolerated or deliberately ignored, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the US," he points out.
The child killer confesses that she has complained on the Internet about the "hardship" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki."
Under this name, which she leads from a small point of view, she is in contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
In order to understand this, one must know her love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman started a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial woman in 1998.
She spent a year.
Shortly after she had disbanded her relationship, she became known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-wife never let him do a DNA analysis.
She had a different relationship soon after.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him this, he liked it, but now he is of course aware of what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to be able to do and to leave what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy to."
She's complaining, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she talks about the return to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I will have to imagine a job if I do not want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her first-born if everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with someone but my mother," a dubious intention to consider their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the first of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other, not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will take a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. See, if he wants to, he'll find me, like, shit."
On the 30th one more: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He's shooting money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages of it.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now closed, and in which she called herself "Muki, the Detainer."
"Terror a la gallega (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, an sworn hunting officer, explains to have a conscience bite because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the center of prison in Menorca to the provincial prison of Palma.
The official defender, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she had no intention of causing any damage to the little one."
She had previously confessed, however, that César had drowned in the bathtub and that he had stored his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric opinion.
Pardo Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in the number of votes and members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the parliamentary elections - or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has in these elections is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday the PPC scored 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote and the commitment of the PP's electorate - should continue, the PP's analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while also CiU would win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (from 25).
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party's analysis, the ERC would lose a Member - at present it has three - while ICV could hold its Member or win one.
However, if the election calendar is to be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue at the scale to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and by its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city's largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will not be able to reach a majority in the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists will not be able to use their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not a question of losing the party's representation in the Barcelona Council, in which it would have to reach 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragona's change, where they had ruled together with the PP in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Ángel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party has also seen a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 local authorities in Catalonia and aims to establish lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell got Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police arrested by the Barcelona Police Department and the Nigerian police were the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "LTTE" (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombay attacks, which in 2008 claimed 106 dead people - provided passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior is of great importance to these studies, which goes so far as to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" has been "weakened" in the world, and thus "its ability to act."
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was made, so that their "fighters" could go beyond the borders of European and other Western countries without a penalty.
The exposed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units, apart from the Thai investigation bodies, have been involved in the investigation. It is not to be excluded that in the next few days there will be similar attacks in the EU area as the one that was carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt, as well as the Thai Sirikanya Kijumung, were arrested.
They had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - was in particular the case of tourists who took passports in accordance with the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents were issued on the name of men aged 25-45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
In the course of the investigation, it is stressed that until now no links have been established between the arrests in Catalonia and the Bombay assassination, even though the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba," was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated a large-scale documentation.
PP requests Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present to Artur Mas, in person, their conditions in support of his entry into office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, who did not differ from those already present during the election campaign and can be combined with the primacy of the economic recovery and the failure of regionalist independence taxes, like a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party, with the certainty that Artur Mas, who gave it the 18 Members she had won last Sunday - a paragraph that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regional party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to the vote abstaining at the time of his entry into office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to make in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As regards the party leaders of the PPC, it calls for "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" to be held in support of the entry into office, as well as an agreement on the financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region, similar to the one in the Basque country, and which the head of the party of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum.
Both political leaders agree that they want to make the built-in political apparatus of the regional administration more slender and to abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for the entry into office of Mas are discussed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old-age home in Olot do not rule out the fact that their nurse killed over 11 elderly people
The leaders of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they highlighted the damage that the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the nurse who had killed at least 11 old people for whom he was responsible during his work - had done to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced, "La Caritat wants to charge the person responsible (for the deaths)," but "the right and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a loss of social respect, because it had not found in time the criminal acts of the nurse, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he had continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone because of their age and diseases.
The head of La Caritat completely denied this point and stated that "the absence of measures could not at the time have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no evidence of negligence in the case of a person other than the accused."
The man who was already baptized as "death angel" confessed to 11 murders the day before yesterday and declared that he had committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and that he had killed the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that the access of staff to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail used the nurse in six out of nine crimes to free the patients from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila was lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had, according to the confession, done to three women who he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, one does not believe in the statements of the nurse, not even in the number of murders that could be more, and this attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say that they have made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatening of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded very strongly yesterday to the threat of President Trichet, who warned "the markets should not underestimate our response."
The risk increases of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and that the euro has hardly increased in points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the purchase of public debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the repeal of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity to be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the program to be continued for the purchase of bonds and to issue a strong signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday will be thrown back again and if we insist on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, at which the Bank confirmed that it would not take into account the purchase of state debt documents and then break down the markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year-old state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The state asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the debt hole figures were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government must be given parliamentary approval for its new budget and, as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries have the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
In comparison with February, the response of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government loan that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we are looking for a strong demand that will eliminate all the doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need, and the Treasury has EUR 40 billion at its disposal, three times as much as in March, and interest rates are very expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only is being important, but also the appearance."
Courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Eulen, at the request of his children, is calling on the members' meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, Owner of the Eulen and El Enebro societies, does not escape.
David Álvarez, the founder of the company's gurp, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th day at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers it "absolutely void." His children will try to obtain a majority in order to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children, Jesús David and María José, are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be willing to give in in to his case for the control of the organs of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January of this year, which is already registered as being contested in the Commercial Register.
The meeting of the shareholders of El Enebro, which was convened for the 16th time by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2, has launched a new thunder strike in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
The appeal of the judge to the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the Assembly of 18 January declared void by legal spies, deceptions and abuse," as official speakers say.
This argument is the basis for the challenge of the Assembly in retrospect in order to declare it "absolutely void."
The same protagonists, who are in discrete silence, tried to convene a meeting in June without success on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro - the asset company and the owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez 'seven children control 100% of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group calls for the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the real background to the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the action for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, their history in this fine universe has been marked by the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and, despite his steeply ascending career during the last seasons, at the final sprint last November, all set on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without trying to reduce the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands of, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This software, called the PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industrial department, explains that using this software in the Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are found on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm states that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
The Red Bulls team today employs 180 highly qualified young people. With high-performance computer systems they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager said that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all components of the Red Bull race cars, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula One team is allowed to spend on its races in one season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars in a 50 km from London.
These are two buildings in which visits, especially by journalists, are very limited.
All that's happening there is Top Secret.
The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 - hero is without doubt the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
The enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the service of his participation on the race tracks are hidden from other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is zero.
The plant's technology director, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in R & D was a 50 percent victory for racing cars and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed, and the technology is 85 percent of the success, while the pilot's contribution is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will open in two years twenty own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty shops, each with between 80 and 100 square metres, which the multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned as an example the converted shop on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the new openings to come, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice-president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. She is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales point network was intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises when buying and after, even the packaging."
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that will solve the technical problems of the HP devices with a guarantee.
An online service will establish a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and micro-enterprises and private customers, because large companies already have their technical service contracts," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' his rival in three years' time
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but at first rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in the interest rate margins that banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years' time - a subject that is still to be found.
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the next three years and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without the use of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000 if you take off the customers that the bank will lose - and this is the big challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The Bank will present the challenges it faces together with the annual accounts report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has mixed all the banks' plans worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will complete its four-year plan for Optima, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended for one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a wide range."
The manager assumes that Spain is only "slow" to come out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years' time - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war will be flouted by liabilities - which will punish the margin of interest - the risk increases that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will already be turned to the price of loans as a compensation for declining profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We did not turn off the cock, but the interest rate differences are very high," admitted Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto already issued an order to its branch network to limit the provision of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the status of "increasing the fees," but "within a competitive framework."
Sabadell's plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year, everything will change," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "increasing" and does not exclude some Spanish financial institutions from going down in red.
He considered that the FROB could replace the money market in the case of captital increases.
After he assured that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he disagreed with the argument of some bankers who already predicted a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but, unlike the events in June, short-term financing could be achieved through repos and thus the crisis could be cut off.
CECA excludes a second wave of savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that a wave of savings banks could be created and stressed the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
When the Spanish savings banks' concentration process began, several savings banks did not insist on taking part in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings Bank Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but they were adjustments."
"The largest part is complete. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
In a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limit set in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta said that "there are a number of unsolicited opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed our indifference and insensibility," because "Banco de España exhorts us to complete before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the whole world, and added that those who refused to do so "without deeper knowledge."
The manager noted that in the current economic situation we have to "do not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have been through a "very important" concentration process, which will be "carried out as soon as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time has established conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers or the abolition of the 426 euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefit, and the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as the responsible person who had evoked the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations.
On the contrary, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which is in conflict with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is starting to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although this is more like science fiction at the moment - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is a redesign of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of the countries that cross the rules; possible termination of some countries' payments and the extension of the cost of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been clear for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission provided incentives for deficits and the German government took out a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the gap between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was made by the Central European country, when Merkel made the decision to save Greece painfully.
At that time, this was strongly criticised, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October Merkel has come out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to be saved and, at the same time, to require private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has driven the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, although a little sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the opposing countries are severely punished, can be forced to declare themselves insolvent and, in this case, the private sector must take over part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must take a hard growth course, with high rates of savings and investment, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad not to understand.
It is not just a question of reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will become more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities we are offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has been set in motion.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like something would change.
Among the options considered, it is not impossible to exclude the fact that we have to leave the euro area that is fully stocked with little serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulatory circumvention
Tricks like that of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed over whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next game against the Auxerre and enter the next game without cards.
In the end, the UEFA disciplinary team punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the participating players with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules followed in this sport.
Part of the emerging debate about the case is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who in his hymn pretended to be noble and honour and on other occasions had punished his players for similar events) played the leading role in this, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this practice, which is not expressly prohibited by the Statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts are a rule-bypass. In fact, this approach is based on the Statutes of Sports, but seems to be circumventing its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sport spirit should be examined.
The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not at risk by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposing players have an unjustified benefit from the counter-team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally mean by false play or rule-by-rule, because the avoidance of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a penalty, but should be as conspicuous as possible to be punished by the referee.
The players waited and accepted the penalty joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders took from the deliberate fouls.
It should be pointed out that the rival was not placed in a more unfavourable position, nor were the benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is that the players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, to a certain extent uncertain, as the team could at some point also leave. In addition, the players receive a penalty with this approach and go into the second card cycle, in which they leave less than in the first cycle because of card accumulation with a card.
This is not so clear as to whether this is really an advantage.
In the end, such practices are not directed against the sport spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a penalty (this would be a clear case of rule-by-law), they wanted to choose when they would be subject to it.
They made a strategic decision to avoid or escape from it without a punishment.
Although the border between the invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of the invention.
I have the impression that the polemics have been caused by two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than more aesthetic.
Our offer for group Christmas evenings in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year makes an avalanche of reservations fall on the days of 16 and 17 December.
The parties paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, in the pre-Christmas period, there are group evenings that bring oxygen to Barcelona's restaurant and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which is the great mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the interviewed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make the accounting more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two top-level (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group evenings for budget reasons.
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
However the economic situation is, low prices are required, the president of the Barcelona restaurant body, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
The representative of the umbrella association has so far not dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it a few times before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers will save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most demand-driven by 25 euros.
In a survey in various central restaurants it turns out that the evening of December 17 will lead the providers to collapse.
The Soteras group says that the requests for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, who has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the owner of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
With AN Grup, who is responsible for El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 places, one does not lose optimism, since the second quarter of the year the revenue is again blooming and good, though concentrated, prospects for the Christmas business are being seen.
The company group's sources point out that the 18th will also be an over-active day with friends groups celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus. The impression is that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and wish for more details in return, such as Cava.
In some companies you can also see green sprouts sprout, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group food is back in the upswing.
On the part of the Fecasarm umbrella association (with associations such as the Barcelona Kneipen, Restaurant and Leisure Association), the vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are generally quite "lively" even though the customers "beat out a maximum."
The fun of the party, however, had not decreased, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is a major concern in the US
Islamabad is making nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Wikileaks' revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Wikileak Internet portal, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear programme Washington.
In the margins of the clear and juicy details that the documents provide about the content of the talks and the way in which the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad think, they reveal that the cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not increased, but rather "diminishes," and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhytmus than any other country."
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled, but that their individual parts are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - are making Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the Taliban-attacked area, the likely spread of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is no longer considered to be an exuberant reason for being careful, not only by the US, but also by Russia.
"Pakistan must recruit highly credible personnel to guard nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to record people working on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is slowing down and the increased rate of Pakistan's production of nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington, during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" the person responsible that "Pakistan's army has to cease its tacit support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high level of responsibility for the anti-terrorism campaign to prevent new revelations.
Interpol is issuing a red warning for the tracking and detection of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can be easily clarified.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" on the "detection and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On the 20th, the international police authority, based in Lyon (France), issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had received the power.
This is the way things are. The 188 Interpol countries are dependent on identifying and finding Assange "to arrest and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organisation, many Member States consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if it has a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be present.
The action was outraged by Assange's lawyers, who published a letter, in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the Swedish authorities' questions by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and was given the appropriate authorisation by the prosecutor, who was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief of Security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is burying the innocence of her son - Assange is in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of the magazine Time per Skype from an indefinite place. In the conversation, he requested the resignation of the State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus to violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should focus on the opinion of a type with a website," he told the channel CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-level person responsible for the anti-terrorism struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent new document disclosure.
The President's speaker Barack Obama's attempt to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chairing the National Security Committee of the House of Deputies from January, has asked the State Department to examine the possibility of placing Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations "to seize their funds and to track anyone who supports them or contributes."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything that is not execution is a mild punishment," he said to the channel Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with an eye wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to have a secret vote on his continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid, for the first time, an internal riot in the ranks of the ERC without direction after the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the close-up of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same head break as other former currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink of his eyes, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the beginning yesterday, it was announced that the over 200 regional members of ERC could speak out in secret about his stay in office.
With ballot cards, not with a high hand.
If the Carodists wanted to give the President a ticket, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without giving a percentage, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod close-up are asking the President more than just to make his office available to the party. An insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controls the top organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force the resignation, they will agree with the board a plan of operations from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will be submitted to the Council for a vote on 18 December.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, it is to promise to advance the Congress to the fall of 2011, which the party leader already thinks is a fact.
The party president of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" is a pity of stability and he once and for all seeks to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the reigning Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it to be a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for different goals."
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is to say the inclusion of new faces from Caroline's environment.
The second one could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the full assembly principle as a function.
In this way, he is fighting for a reform of the Statutes, which will allow the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
From the end of the full assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, who already fought at the last two congresses for how obsessed.
In fact, at the 2008 quitting assembly, the party leadership was asked to review the general assembly principle at a congress that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, since the internal rest of the last few years was not a good idea to start this matter.
Now, without the critical sector on the loose, the time may have come to take up this matter again and to complete it forever.
23 killed in November, 290 in 2010

China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of China said at COP16 that his country had made a huge effort to reduce the carbon footprint and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made a huge effort to reduce the carbon footprint and to change its industry.
He stated that over the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He said that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity-building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
He said that progress had been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the objectives of reducing emissions of gases.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the states had worked together with those of the central government and the municipalities to achieve the energy saving objectives, the effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
In addition, he explained, some multi-annual plans have already been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those received from other countries.
For example, it referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced in the last five years and which has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs by energy-saving bulbs and another on the weakening and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, a scientific government consultant on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than would be commonly assumed.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a total 9% contribution to pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20% over the last five years and is expected to continue by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN said that the former panist party leader had the right to turn to the National Commission for the Order and to demand what the right was for him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission for the Order and to demand what the right was for him.
In an interview that took place before Gabino Cué Monteagudo's appeal as governor of the state, he said that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Commission of the Order in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional through the appeal procedure, in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never been at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would be strengthened from the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the community election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, therefore "does not scare us of internal competition; on the contrary," we enjoy it and it strengthens us, "he said.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman or the best chairman Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would hand over the staff "to the one the Council would determine."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to give each of the five the office of party president."
He predicted that the party's upswing during the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it was not the time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about helping Governor Gabino Cué in his job."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would bear the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his four-year course in the context of his government, César Nava called on the PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He believes that the Federal Government's owner would be able to make expressions such as those he could do in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no ban on the mouth in this country and even less a censorship.
Obama is committed to the law in favour of unocumented students in Twitter
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and push for the adoption of this law," the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilisation in support of the Dream Act - Law on legalization of and occult students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you're in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
His short communication contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document, which calls on the public to contact its senators under the circumstances, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he says.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators promised to block all the vote for each law, except for the extension of the tax reductions from the time of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could have an impact on the coordination of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
He asked about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be set.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate," so that the Dream Act, with which the initiative to legalize and occult students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American dream, would legalize about 800 000 young people who emigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in that country for the last five years and are registered at a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
That is why the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
One of the most popular Republicans is from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over the mandate of senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they no longer supported it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put the finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust of the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand the thing about sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" said the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and at this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentinian writing company spits sweet to the audience, which was mainly made up of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz then identified as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for to know what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not receive an answer, but from which she is given guidance on the guide to her story.
She is convinced to leave the infectologist: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps this is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the course, and who explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst takes away the secret: "The wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighes and closes that "only the wound learned that it is really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a lovely story, which he called "praise of the invention," in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
With allusions to the magic realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer who brought back the clouds, who was a very mature man, or who restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn and reported about America, the great novel that was not lacking in his own christ from the very beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of the stories told by the conquests.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witness who appeared in the stories that were shown to be true, but in another way the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the shame."
However, he points out, "it is the crazy and the liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"From him we have inherited to be what is being told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the Fil had contributed to the round table 'The finger in the wound'.
The Cuban and Puertorian devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects their country - as in Latin America - as a result of the fight for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentionally planned commitment," she said, after she had stressed that literature is communication and commitment, which is built between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also raised "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer."
He noted that in a fast-living world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness also go to dogmatism, and is forgotten that "behind each confirmation is a small no and behind each denial a small yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and the reality, we must nuance: and nuances often means to put the finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to share the world in black and white, and invited them to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles, set by their respective trainers, are also opposite, and their encounter is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has been well-kept, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has played his way up to the second champion with the medal, he is one step behind the winners and, surprisingly, he has played successive final games with the same team.
= = = Torneo Apertura 2002 = = = In 2002, when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, he had a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the "Clausura 2003," he reached the decisive duel, which he lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablo, Rubén had to take a setback, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went out in a row after 210 minutes, but at the Elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to take his title, but finally three of his players missed the 11 steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablo Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be followed again by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," said the tax man, when they ask him about the lost final games.
The last final game is still in his memory, he assures him that he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared to leave with two elfmeters, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not over, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by 11-meter shooting, he does not worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the 11-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, fate made us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce desire to keep the title in your hands, that left us something for this end game, and we hope that this time will not happen."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer only second champion and for the first time to taste the glory that the titles bring with them.
The US changes the rules for receiving a visa
The persons must present themselves to the services for visa applications before their meeting with the consulate; costs will be reduced in this way.
As from 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change at the Embassy of the United States and in the consulates.
In the new procedure, most of the applicants have to present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before they have been discussed at the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the applicant's biometric data, which shall be verified by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of the processing of the visa is reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is issued.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including temporary visas) and 390 dollars for traders and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to imagine at the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric data is collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the consultation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service surcharge of 26 dollars.
For more information on the new visa application procedure, see the following website: http: / / mexico.usembassy.gov / boletines / sp101201 _ Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to introduce a find tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aerospace Authority (NASA) announced tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented by astrobiology experts at a press conference at the NASA headquarters in Washington tomorrow at 1: 00 p.m.. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the opening of the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory finding for the search for alien life," which led to speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there can be human-like creatures in enemy environments, which one has previously considered uninhabitable. The hypothesis was that they could turn into intelligent beings, like people, when their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all possible life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances are increased that there might be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is shown that "there is a real different life form, a second life form that is different from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its fund at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference is attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) on the question of whether his chemical composition is similar to the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system is being introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition block, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, was already installed, and the four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the introduction of the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo waged against the reform of the organ law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties who controlled the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as alternate chairman.
Corvera Quevedo said that the parties PRI and PAN had established their political position in an institutional way with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting with their political will and if they had not, they would be subdued by both parties again, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this end, I (the opposition coalition) come, that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that after being monopolistic, the Congress should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should rule in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group will start with five Members and they will talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, in allusion to PAN and PRI, said that the Congress had now turned into a 'prey' for two.
"It was just a party before, now they split it up in two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to give them their place in the negotiating tables.
"It is not necessary to leave out five, which will probably be nine Members, on the basis of top decisions, and the five, which are currently seen as being divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because it is a reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others, and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check on just over 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
The sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this check, issued at an amount of 200.144.56 peso, was issued with the number 9258447 last November with the purpose of "settlement of open invoices."
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent out that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount to be owed to her and, as a result, the number of cheques still to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, it just paid the debt, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and this last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law, when a company is called into question by ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for its services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it became known that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places must be improved to penetrate
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas that are in a bad condition and have a bad picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Union, recalled that on different occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and to turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the poor state of the roads and paths had had a negative effect, as the tourists would come to a dazzling and see the disorder, and that they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians do not know what it means to have to close a company one day and they do not worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not do the construction work in this way slowly and unplanned."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance on the part of the city.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid what is happening again. How is it supposed to do this? Well, by means of preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in retrospect," he said.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, but also we inhabitants have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to maintain the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that also look uncared for and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and this type of incident is simply what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Proprición Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, for they would not be properly used and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that had to be brought to the front with the city. To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which must first be cleaned up and cleaned in order to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we promote this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members should take the great responsibility to set a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The Mazatlán business is calling for a dignified Parliament, free of any agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
The 60th Parliament was inaugurated yesterday. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, which is a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that need responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of party and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that the new Members should take the great responsibility to set a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right to act free from agreements between the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival compasses of the leaders and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care of them to do a trustworthy job and above all to work for society and their groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who spoke their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary importance in the state budget to support them.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second few resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is directly competitive with the agroindustry."
The tourism projects must be allocated money, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family would like to see dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for parents to meet these wishes on the next three-royal day, because the household is no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Sometimes it's hard times because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... I'm already on the road with the brats in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana's clothes in size for one-year-old.
"(José Alfredo) said to me," I would like this monster, "but I answered him," Let's wait, boy, "because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sad.
For the older children who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is size 12; ten-year-old Isaac is size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis, around the ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be charged with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in places that were supposed to have served mainly for the production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, Speaker of the Quebec Security Police.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the judicial building in Sherbrooke.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, its possession for sale, the complete and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a long-term investigation, which took place over a year.
"The information received from the public have enabled us to carry out these arrests," specified M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit Estrien of the security police of the Quebec, the Sherbrooke police service and the Mephrémagog police department had taken part in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be easily followed
The draft law of the Conservatives, which according to the government is to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will, in all likelihood, be stepped in after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I am holding bonds with a party that has put on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, at the end of the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembled Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person coming from a seagoing vessel identified as being for the transport of illegal immigrants to be held for up to one year, would violate the Canadian legal and freedom constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism about the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has led the critics by hand, who claim that their party was not steadfast enough to the secret immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take measures against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to do by sending another draft law, the C-35," Chow said.
We do not support the Conservative bill because it is seeking the blame of the refugees and is holding children for at least one year, "Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal transactions that affect Canada and which treat the country as a foot-off."
"They expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kennedy's reaction.
"The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
A conservative, however, said to the agency QMI that the government would call a vote so that each opposing Member would immediately declare himself to his electorate.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public committee of inquiry on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea was not yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropolis has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than just surprised one.
It must be said that this measure was not least discussed at the meeting of the permanent committee of the Quebec police service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "from the hat-enchanted rabbit" and "at the end of a table-ready solution."
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who fear that political power had too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he was pleased to confirm.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Prent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and policy systems at ENA (state-owned university for the training of high-level administrative officials).
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposed that Quebec give a special mandate to the audit control so that it can carry out appropriate research on corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the same power as Commissioners to audit control, which would allow it to commit people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better placed to deal with this type of crime.
This demand was made by Operation Marteau's chief attorney, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law in this type of law enforcement is not clear.
In turn, Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemp's 2001, which concerned the groups of the motorcycle police, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been revised.

Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers continue to be under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has taken place in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, a landslide came on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has fallen into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall has hit several regions, ranging from 40 to 70 millilitres.
Between 20 and 40 more millimetres of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday night.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
There had been a total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers down here.
Since the snow melt that has already accumulated in certain subareas is to be added to these precipitation, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quabecer Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, the heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marceline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a soft bridge was torn away due to the strong rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, says security counsel Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quabecer National High Water Center issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assemption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont in part redesigned
The Quabecer radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social services and Haitians as well as because of his outgoing speaking via radio.
The CCNR considers that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinion, but certain statements had included "inaccurate information on the social services and unjustifiably negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such an outrageous way of speaking, which is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which includes the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide, is in breach of the Code of Radio Transmission.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 programmes.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the "Front community des personnes assistées sociales du Québec."
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Instead, the moderators should provide sound and misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the view that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the" Dupont le midi "programme in question would have raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not given any blame for his person.
The last point concerned the statements that had related to the earthquake in Haiti.
In this respect, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had come up with a media-effective dispute that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI presenter had declared not to have given in favour of Haiti's aid, because one does not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already released my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of an unobtrusive expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM had acted "beyond its obligations."
The consequences for the radio station, which had, among other things, to make its decisions unique during the main time-limit within a three-day period, are small.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who is brilliant in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), kickbox and Thai box, is now increasing in the search for new challenges to the Tatami and the world's boxing rings.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxing," said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008, in order to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground struggle as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare. "
Recently, the man who worked as a security officer and worked at the company UPS had given his rivals some bad news, in which he received two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Championships of amateurs held in Edinburgh, Scotland between 23 and 30 October.
"I have won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and thaibox," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in the San Shou in China."
"The fighters from each category were invited, who had placed themselves among the first four at the last World Cup."
"I got baby bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005, I became the eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while in 2009 I became third in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will become first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, in which fists and footsteps are allowed as well as floor designs.
The two-fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most prestigious boxing fighter, who has come out of this kind of martial arts, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence in the Super-Tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," said the sympathetic Pfundskerl.
"It is a bit like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analysed.
"There are four members per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category stand up to crown a single champion, the king of Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without an invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has, by mutual agreement, granted project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without an invitation to tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a concurrent to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to transfer this important, hydroelectric project of a sum of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the "Énergie gérance" consortium entered into the lucrative contract without a public invitation to tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of displacing competition and increasing prices.
"This is a new way of a recorded game and dissolves the competition."
"This means that instead of playing the game in a secret way, it is now in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ member, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public's interest can be served in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by denouncing the fact that this treaty was a game that had been played.
"I remain true to my line," she waved by encouraging the PQ to be "unhonest" and "lack of hardness."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is a world-wide practice.
It is usually a time-limited alliance, which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope.
The construction process is under way and is due to be established by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition, and negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the consortium's model in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" said last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflight of the Quabecer business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the "Énergie gérance" consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying particular attention to this fact since the 1970s."
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énenergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has given the nose to the fact that the project management contract has been approved by agreement.
"If you make a call and there are only a few candidates, your prices will increase."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mart and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte said.
This contract, approved by the "Énergie gérance" consortium, is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" had more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which were approved between 2002 and March 2010 by companies or their branches, including, in particular, resource laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Énergie gérance."
All these contracts have been negotiated.
In total, it amounts to $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known by the "Parti libéral du Québec."
Minister Normandeau had said that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that "financed it" before she made it clear that it was rather their managers.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not a source of confidence
Green, but unwavering skeptical.
The Quabecer Consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but also no confidence in the marked brands or eco-labels to control its choice.
It is a pity, though, that it bathes in a media-active universe, where it is filled with information in favour of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that is seen as a brake on its commitment, as shown by the first reading held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of the so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quabecers still seem to be paying little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quabecer population admits that they do not believe in the environmental activities of companies as much as they do in green business advertising, the instrument of measurement drawn up by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke reveals.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates added to the supposed fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which declare themselves environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the political discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quabecer population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by almost a third of the Quabecer consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampen the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the quabecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services that they are being given.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and had mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometers, they had also preferred 61% of the purchases from the dealers of their district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo-consumer of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and environmental consciousness seems to have stopped before its car, according to the barometer: only 28% of the Quabecers have indicated that in 2010 they have used public transport or preferred the driving centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which is the source of the cliché ideas.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quabecer government, which was asked by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agreed to a cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return it to its actual cineastic function, obviously do not receive what they have requested.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quabecer government offers a bond at a lower level than the initially expected, which could create a viable solution on favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources that can be removed from the state's odour kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request for a petition has been corrected since the end of the year.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des Entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to answer them.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have been really pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quabecer ownership community of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by making the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there, which he had not given to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment, in contrast, claimed substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, KinoChef Daniel Langlois had presented the author's ino in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years, which could justify the state treasury's exemption.
The lack of cinema channels that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele on the bar.
The Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are in turn operating a privately funded campagne, from which they hope a total of $700 000 will be available to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux."
But Christian Yaccarini did not withdraw the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignored what he and his group thought of the down-corrected proposals they had made.
Secret of the complex shaken Canada
The new American diplomatic leaders, which were spread by WikiLeaks, revealed the secret of what the United Nations considers to the Americans under the Canadian minority complex, but with the same blow they reveal the feeling of superiority to Canada of the latter.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not have the meaning of Canadian-American relations in the course of the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were published in public yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantial content on which one has to be nodded.
A connection dated 22 September 2008, in the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A minority complex that is almost inherent in the Canadians may lead the Canadian, political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than to push the United States to the black Peter in this election (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The Ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more of a party leader to have such an essential relationship that the electorate has in mind as a key factor in the course of the course of the course."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business owner in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the government's continued existence in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, due to a 30-40 billion dollar recovery programme," Breese says.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed training programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, is an increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast through CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also abduction for the purpose of hearing by the CIA's muscle prots.
Another communication reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case by case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, "he has given the State Secretary a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to look through the file again."
Finally, let us note that the minds are heating up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close consultant, had explained through CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He was here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (CFCs), which corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction to be implemented in order to stabilise the world's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the step of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by the developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFCs put on the ground due to the lighting would be avoided if the white-burning pears, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or even better, by light-emitting diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the large exhaust gas emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it would be necessary to draw 5 Gt from this balance to stabilise the 2 degree Celsius climate increase from today to 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-burning pears, 95% of the energy is in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs one reduces this energy demand again by twice.
The compact fluorescent bulbs hold an average of between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer of Philips has put on the market this week - this company, by the way, has taken part in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-burning bulb, which is an indication of the potential savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that completely new light bulbs give very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves as they contain mercury and that they must be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for the producers providing a reception point.
According to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but the coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-burning pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year on electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly expects the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast directly after its time-limit.
"The Secretary-General stressed the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to publish the preliminary results without further delay," said a press officer of the UN Head.
"It invites all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had the deadline set at Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue with work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud that the CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup that failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN-led maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had discouraged the President's supporters to go to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the actions brought by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo opponents, however, are now more of the opinion that the highest court in the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in the announcement of the election results to be "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew he had lost; and filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court after the election commission had been prevented from publishing the results, was illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was considered to be the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for them in the event of any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of the elections on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, as defined by the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), as shown by the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7%, with the overseas departments being included.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million people in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were operational every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points over three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the involvement of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, the IAA reported that 637.000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
The elderly, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the 50-year-old population, 6.6% with the overseas departments included.
Only the 25-49 year-olds had been able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, + 0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, and he was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and fraud-suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of social assets, embezzlement of general goods, hegemony, complicity in corruption, illegal bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and is planning to comment on all the questions the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading brain spies."
"It is easy to subject him to a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had stressed the need to give the judge, by means of his lawyers, a reminder of his justification before his hearing.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than to keep his landfill, which he had to run, running.
He would never have had knowledge of the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, said Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Region, was also charged on Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but then set free again under the order to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to explain the facts that were accused of him."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and were released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, said Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) waste management company, is being prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery."
Two state officials of the Aubagne conurbation, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Hovering and embezzling public goods by an official of the public service," the other on the grounds of "complicity in the embezzlement of public money."
The partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "heheheresy and embezzlement of social assets."
One of the people who were faced with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently in prison for a similar affaire of fraudulent public action that had affected Corsica.
The suspects suspect his company to have helped to wash money from "high" crime groups.
The investigation of X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the field of disposal, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
It can be seen from nearby sources that the investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the territory of Aubagne and from certain cities in the city of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace overacts its medium function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, who was held in Iran for "espionage," kept the French public in breath, put diplomacy on the alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attentive look of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and published by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and sought by the American justice system for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a blatant light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this respect.
A diplomatic telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the way in which hostage-taking is handled."
François Richier, an Elysée Policy Adviser, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do their utmost to return their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without fail" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do this."
Because "silence does not solve anything," past the discussion attempts on the unobtrusive way that Iranians are "masters in evasive manoeuvres."
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactic": "hostage-taking for the purpose of political blackmail."
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to take place on 16 August, on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (EUR 230,000 deposit).
And he leaves out a message that Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that will "become more intense."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been put into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is asking for from Iran for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which is following the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The Iranian's liberation against the French woman?
On the occasion of a new meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to stand up to it.
"There has been a strong exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but" the French Government cannot change the judicial decision, "he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, sets up again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not save its efforts to make "escape attempts" organised by the media, and the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad play an "important" and "influential role in the process."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 summons "the media flash of the French authorities."
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy is asking itself.
"Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to forfeit this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, "which was perceived as premature and unworthy by many critics in France and abroad."
"Building the Syrian role" Paris "is trying to show Syria what it is possible to achieve by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our countrymen."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella," which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight by blocking access, so indicated government leaders.
A bill to call on online games operators to prevent young people under the age of 16 from having access to these games after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, with representatives of cultural and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties with learning at school and also with running a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure her health and her right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the draft law of the French press agency Agence France Press.
The online games are then again available from 6: 00 in the morning.
The manufacturer companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also envisaged asking manufacturers to unscrew the time limit for access to these games every day for those young people whose parents ask, added the responsible person.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to have the opportunity to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an uncontested champion in world-wide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the country of origin
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee, in a light of excitement due to the suspicion of corruption, appoints the leaders of the World Championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the need for influence and lobbying threaten to put the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA Royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
So the actions behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have just as well ruined the opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to hold the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC had once again given the ground to this on Monday, by broadcasting a documentary report, which is under attack by three influential members of the student, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to make the FIFA angry and embarrass the English leaders who, in the first place, had made intensive lobbying with David Cameron over the last few weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a new edition of the chess train, which was won by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had won the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive use be enough to revalue the image of England in front of the student?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack any debris with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial side of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, will increase Russia's chances, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport), has become a major outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the indisputable reference to the English press' unfair competition in the preparation of the vote 'by the members of the group.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin waved.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, the headquarters of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
But these new candidates seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the 2002 competitions.
Another threat: the approval of the World Cup 2026 by FIFA for China, which will make the Asian opportunities to become obsolete in 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had all the registers with the maintenance of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may have to suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift), the delicate nerve of FIFA, which the European countries have had.
Second mandate: visibility
De Gaulle had really stoned.
Mitterand had made him think he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show any hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the visibility is not good at the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend to be in doubt.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011."
The fact that he would make the perspective of "two mandates" sound in front of the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening in the Elysée had thus spread a little feverish.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President simply pointed out that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five years of office to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"At worst, you still have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Do not believe that I do not think about the period after that."
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before, but no less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
It is not, however, the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS are more early than expected to call for a battle announcement.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," responded directly and carefully the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he found a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrected Alain Juppé, who has come to terms with the visibility.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of state paper
The last meeting of the ECB's Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to its conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt is committed, and the central bank in Frankfurt cannot, of course, afford to take advantage of today's more than tense situation in the European bond markets, so as not to cause their deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, at a press conference yesterday, welcomed the active role played by the ECB in the resolution of the European public debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the central bank can do more, for example by stimulating its programme of buying-in of government bonds.
"I keep my considerations for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels the day before, when he was heard by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, had not shown much talk about his projects, but rather was content to point out that the programme of purchases of state papers on the secondary market would "continue" and that we "will see at the meeting on Thursday what the decisions will be."
Only certainty: The ECB will keep its central rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, last week the ECB doubled the Treasury's commitments to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to some traders' indiscretion, it was said that it had made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
Since May 2010, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion.
There is no doubt among the dealers that the anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase price is in any way a question (see page 29).
The landlords do not expect a remarkable change in course.
If the bond transactions of over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be created in a free-standing way, over a period of one week to three months.
The citizens are already looking forward to the fact that this measure will continue to be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
"Otherwise, it would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the economist of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," in turn anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should keep such a volume of bonds that will boost the market," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro-zone sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must come to the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the most vulnerable states," an important obligation holder testified yesterday.
In fact, if interest rates were to be used for high-altitude flights, countries would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government takes cover in Italy
After a week of concern to Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday with the fall in the basic interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional leaders Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "innumerable" and had heard him expect an "unforeseeable" weekend, which the person concerned did not agree immediately.
In any case, on Tuesday, the German interest rate scissors would have reached a record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had increased to 263 points, which had led to some headlessness in Rome.
At its Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed a "serious concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, the economist at the Hudson Institute.
In clear terms, it means that its problem is the decline in economic growth and the resulting, dizzy tax revenues that put the state at risk of being able to no longer meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget budget for the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission estimates, the budget deficit will be 4.3% of GDP next year (against the 3.9% forecast by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
This is why a new budget group has been set up, which could be used for a sum of EUR 7 billion after the public holidays.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says the accountant Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is being given the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, and we have been repeating this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high level of debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is demanding less stability progress than other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD's chief economist.
The question of political inconsistency remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the preferred elections to be organised at the end of March.
So there is a little time to decide on a serious crisis.
European thinking about the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it was proved on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are clearly holding together, ready and committed to defend their currency and their area."
Although completely relative - the reduction in the interest rate on European government bonds yesterday was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to talk about a start to normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce the debt note of Portugal, probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perception, which is particularly a burden on the banking systems," said the people of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "the political time is much slower than that of the markets."
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that is hidden in it, are stepping up discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in the wider sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan sets out the set of unconventional measures for the back-up of the euro area countries at the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Funds, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he will certainly prepare the ground for it.
The EU Stability Fund's first advertising expenditure is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters agency had entrusted the United States to support a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first line, are, for their part, ready to take on structural reforms, in particular in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are added to the austerity measures, but are expected to have effects in the near future.
The European Union is not in a position to take the necessary steps to ensure that the European Union is able to do so.
Both the one and the other, at all costs, is to avoid asking for international assistance before they have established their own budget corrections and have decided on the necessary structural reforms that will bring them back to their confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are talking about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of the sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, first of all had the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to move back into its own pocket.
The economies of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of the European public debt, judge that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means that the European mechanism of doped financial stabilisation currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory committee which has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in European capitals.

Snow and Smooth: 24 departments in Orange alert level
The snow episodes still cause traffic problems, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect different economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alert level due to the risk of snow and smooth ice.
The regions of Eure, Eur-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in Orange alert level; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers do the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions concerned are the regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic obstacles and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who do not recommend using their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In the Picardie, the school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The Prefecture "calls on drivers to be very careful on the streets and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on the airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights from Roissy Airport in Paris and 10% of the flights starting from Orly due to the expected strong snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in southern London and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start the construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital envelope of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then be able to give in the markets part of the financial total to its double.
The first estimates have finally come to be made today.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was reviewed this morning by the National Assembly's Financial Commission, contains the measures to be taken to make the first part of these funds available.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax for the establishment and higher taxation of offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, in the form of Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
The figure is as follows: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
It is a new order of the already existing company taxation: "to modernise it, to increase its resulting product and to transfer this increase of the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would that make?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not included in the text.
Of the 4 billion you are far away.
"It is said that the tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital envelope imposed by the State and gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement is given.
At the SGP, this system is not at all offensive.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e., the tax), you can cover the project for over three years and then you can only draw it from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billion are promised, will be able to be sought for a long time, is in danger of creating a rather moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Righteous hackers and big spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy that governs the relationship between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's do it in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi are nothing more than what you have been reading in every x-any journal for months anyway (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the frightening caricatured profile of Gaddafi has been offering cabaret artists material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule that the secret files can only be made up of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will see that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosary) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he did not know where to find news about the non-existence), but because those who are dedicated to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The secret files, too.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognises to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department, was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a call made for the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the leaders can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation tasks, have become espionage centres.
Any spectator of the investigation films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
In second place, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the state decree.
In addition, the scandal is less likely to cause the victims than the "snipers."
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
In Orwell's times, you could combine all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be completely right since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But when one is aware of what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control course stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the judge of the citizen - can discover the secrets of the power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the sense of WikiLeaks, to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to deprive them of all power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this infirmity that has been inflicted on such a great power?
It is obvious that in the future the States will no longer provide any reserved information online - that would be the same as an exit on the street corner.
But it is also obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relations be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself forced to introduce the government agents, to move in a secret way on uncontrollable march routes, to carry their communications anywhere else than in the mere memory, and, in addition, to the few written information they have received, to hide them in the shoe set.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the Wassergate spy attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is moving forward like a cancer today, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to discover a film band for the band, by spilling from the back to the front and air all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs today do not allow anything but to jump from chapter to chapter, in other words in macroporations.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including the change.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At the moment, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France bequeathed its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the implementation of the fast-to-do financing promises (also called "fast-start" or early financing) implemented by the developing countries.
And the rough French beauties are already exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to fast-start financing: the detailed approach report of its Member States, the press conference, large side events, the distribution of brochures.
The transparency operation is remarkable and is now valued for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, bringing it on the right path to respect its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort has been made without being sufficient to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the target value that they consider best.
The European Commission, for example, has chosen as a benchmark for those in 2009: international financing is maintained and gives over 150 million in the framework of the "fast-start" financing over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of ODA.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no indicative figures for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of ODA.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule on this yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 €borrowed as equivalent to 1 €donated.
It is obviously difficult to do this: the effort is not comparable.
If it is possible to justify the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often related to emission-based projects based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro that is collected as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the capital country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% of them (36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that is using loans to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) are 100% committed to donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France only gives 10 cents and is a similar commitment.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double flaw: part with a further development of the action over time and part with the reality of the financial use.
France is able to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its promises, saving EUR 36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once EU-internal (why do the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let them completely deceive...
The chapter of early financing only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machine of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject-matter of long-term financing (another, decisive and currently under discussion): it is not possible to get away from the question of "predictability" or the way in which its loans are held.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the rapid start of France and its vision of "predictability" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years is taking up 81 different chemical substances, such as a study published this Wednesday by the Génération Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "do not represent a statistically significant value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but rather an illustration of the problem being dealt with," had bought the food normally consumed in July and September within four, from a 10-year-old child to the meals, plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been studied by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carciogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptive factor, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in the near whole of cases, the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, it is very well from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptive factors is worrying," the association notes.
Even at breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three of them are certainly known as carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues which may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study has found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the gum were fed by pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
During dinner, the salmon steak with 34 chemical residues found was "the most rich," and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is likely to be underestimated," the study said.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the light of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilian diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
