Triumph of the right-wing lists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
A significant weakening of both parties of the so far great coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the first preliminary results of the pre-scheduled Sunday parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the verge.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner head of state Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results to date, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8% of the votes, but it loses 5.5% of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP was even worse, with 25.6 percent losing almost nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially the People's Party, which had requested the pre-elections, is a really catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had resigned from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there was already speculation about the possible resignation of the party president and former vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the election debacle, in other words to a renewal of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed at the same time their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, and in 2005 it had split off from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even led to sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already said that he is ready to work with each party and goes from a return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
In addition, the Green Party moved into Parliament, but it suffered slight losses and, among the Austrian political parties, slipped from third to fifth.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent wreath and therefore did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been charged in India for the illegal collection of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that some cooling of the Czech-Indian relations could occur.
This was stressed by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then surely, then there will be a certain cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that the executive was difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of all this, he claimed that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case-law the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukherdshi to appeal to a higher authority.
He could thus request the release of bail and wait in freedom for his judgment, according to the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same opinion in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be possible for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the condemned "competent legal support," the Indian Minister pointed out.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that, "Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he, the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, said that the Czech Republic was of great importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
In response to the question of whether he had received an undertaking from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the Minister left.
"I've already been promised a lot," he just said.
A Czechs judge the struggle around the bottom of the sea
It approaches an electronic map, on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are depicted.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent sea bottom.
The area is as large as the continent itself, "said the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member staff of the UN Divison for Oceans and the Rights of the Sea.
His boss, the head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
This is where work and enthusiasm prevail.
The bottom of the sea has so far been a little known world rich in natural sources.
This is where oil is found, the other ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, have the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed, larger than the mainland
Today, the countries bordering the country have strongly declared their claim to the new sea areas.
In fact, according to a UN Convention, they make use of their rights, on which they agreed in the year 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often goes up to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"In simple terms, the part of the sea floor and its soles, which is a natural continuation of the continent below the surface of the sea, is considered as a continental cord.
It crosses the borders of the shore sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone, "explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the determination of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
To date, only the last three countries have been successful, "adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia recently came to an international echo, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times more than the size of the real state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profit that will come to them in the future from the use of the sea floor will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement."
Where the continental shellfish ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is called the "common heritage of humanity" by the Convention.
This is where no state has a special position.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor, however, is not a gold-grabber land," says Director Mikulka with a little exaggeration and adds that "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is established in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organisation "Interoceanmetal."
In 1991, the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other countries, gave it the status of a "groundbreaking investor."
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the silent ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tata on the bottom of the sea.
"You can support there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary Shem, who, according to the legend, brought to life the Golem.
German special forces were on the ground in case of hostage-free
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of 11 European tourists abducted in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue.
As a result, both specialists in the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the Fliegerstaffel of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Relief Agency were at the site of the liberation.
As speakers of the ministries further reported on Monday evening, however, the German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers ran their prisoners and fled when they had seen signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to involve them as local support forces.
"Fortunately, this has not happened," said a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had taken the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on September 19.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged back and forth.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived in Cairo in a safe and safe way.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were in the care of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information at first on when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has just failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones was rushing into the deep.
By 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals by US President George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme to reduce the chaos on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for the prevention of something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke down by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The reason for the concern of investors was that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure was known, he fell down again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
For the programme to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Organiser records increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
In spite of the weak economic prospects, the German people's desire to travel remains undisturbed in a study.
For the winter season bookings, the travel agencies recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year's period, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
For example, the sales increase of the travel agencies for October had been about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV announced.
These results are based on figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and is extrapolated for the total market.
The travel bookings were made by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar rate, travel to the US was in particular required, the DRV announced.
In this case, the increase in booking amounts to about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local areas of the Germans, are particularly popular destinations.
In particular, travel would be high in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing costs of energy and food, the costs are "better calculated for the customer than for the individually organised holiday."
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there would be a return on sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer made of liter-krugen and celebrities in designer-Dirndn.
It's a weave debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, TV presenter and she's wearing a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing is connected to us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already coming down on us and they are full of the memory cards - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap-Dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
When Wén-Touri and actually north of the Weißwurstequator, the feeling of well-being remained limited in the performance until now.
But first of all, on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or Lederhosn; no one looks at the face of the eye or is embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange looks at the Shokobanan stand only reap my scum.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I would have mistied the apron: "Left house free, middle virgin, right, behind widowed."
I mean, I'm going to be happy with the loop from the back to the left.
"Fits," said and laughs.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked back of the body unprayed.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and is also visiting the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgous," with a long-drawn "oooo."
This is what he tells me after he has removed himself from his previously fallen measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wild biesler."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, the paramedics run across the festival, who have to take care of the poor swallowing.
The nurses always perform in the pack - always four at a time carry a covered carrier from tent to tent.
This works like with most of the visitors to the meadow: empty, fully back.
You can't see those who are in the promille coffin under the tarp.
"This is what they are, wos goonimmer packn," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the tumble.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspicion of a light-minded driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey was seeking to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel guides tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart about
But once you are within the vaulted ticket switch, there is no doubt about the sublime nature of the project, whose most western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a spatula in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to implement the Middle East, by means of a train to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what Saudi Arabia is today.
But Germany's imperialist plans were slammed during the first World War.
His railway tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, a munitions train was blown up and the artistic roof was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly disintegrated, largely passed by history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all to the east of it to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The ruling justice and development party, the ACP, has introduced a fucking new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of approach.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I have climbed the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish Member of Parliament, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail," I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new secular state project, to return to the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has taken me to the main office of the ACP, a specially designed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburban, surrounded by semi-finished shopping centres and pubs in which medium-sized managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception, "he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look at the east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can, in the sense of the word, be on the same rail lines east of Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (obituary on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir in 1979 sang for the last time some of us were already at the end of the 20th - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never faded for years.
How often did death stop us "to let the music speak for itself."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So it sings! "
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never ruling, but never overflowing.
However high the musical level was, he always called for an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He disliked conductors who, according to his words, simply "went to house with one or two known caterpillars in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End," but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry."
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 as part of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino' Flamenco and Life 'because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, how they always deal with respect for the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments. '
Second round of excellent sale at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large space limousine offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical fineness, which allow even more comfortable driving and fuel saving.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this large-scale limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be stressed.
However, before you start to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other producers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car of the year 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After the jazz was released on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
However, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected increase in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the brand leaders hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models. That is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese producer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the rest is distributed on the Old continent and Japan.
The opening of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase of the dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-liter petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both versions have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high-speed performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 revolutions with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min? 1.
This petrol engine - the previous model of jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to get to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Car bee 'that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, to be more precise, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight dates back to the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Head of Technology PR and R & D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval-shaped flight room, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the face eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
The technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF) in order to recreate the all-round perspective.
He notes obstacles that are at a distance of up to two meters before the BR23C and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for the avoidance of the collision
'At the moment when the obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels by 90º or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference with other systems is that this evasive manoeuvre is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can neither go up nor down, but not above; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and braking functions, Nissan has used the rotation function to prevent the small robot from collisions.
'This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made, so it can work continuously with only a few dozens of KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan is planning to introduce to the series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, in order to lead to the goal while driving, avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She's shaking before she gets charged with a mortgage.
One must understand that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the US citizens being involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly viable banks, an entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfers was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'Hotel of bad loans' or the perverse.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think one, two and up to three times if it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for the teenagers than a place for all the spectators.
What will happen when the game is extended?
Well, if there's a beautiful room in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides her capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into their company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of their capital, a innovation due to a strong case of their stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a single price of $25.25, which is a total of $3 billion.
The price assumed is less than 19% of the price value of the share on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley said that the global business will be based on a single average price of $29, 28% above the current price value.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars against 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic link is an important opportunity to speed up the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of holding bank," said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which is intended to allow him to extend their business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
'A week ago, 'said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo,' we thought that the participation would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will be about 20% reduction in the profit per share.
The agreement provides that, in a year's time, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into ordinary shares if the latter are replaced by more than 50% above the sales value, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, to strengthen their balance sheet and to increase their sales.
However, one of the group's press speakers refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a solvency rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said he had 'clearly' reduced his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been hard for the group, who had to watch their stock market price fall by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency was rising.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had taken 15 billion dollars, some of them from Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refounded the Republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorial Rafael Correa.
It was that third party who, following the example of his like-minded and friends, made the plan of a new constitution a choice.
In the referendum, 64% voted 'yes'.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballot cards were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, a vote must be reached for more than half of the votes cast.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the electoral centres and a census of a non-governmental organisation had announced a clear victory for 'yes' and had prophesied to it 63% to 70%.
The night from Sunday to Monday, by the way, Rafael Correa had called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured and congratulated the Equatorial people in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 km southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the observation order of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points in order to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transmits state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives, to a large extent, from oil production by foreign companies and foreign exchange, which send emigrants to the country.
The project, which is being promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also gives the head of state greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, it also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for 11 days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital in a healthy and unharmed manner this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived at the military base of al-Maza, right next to Cairo International Airport, at around 3: 30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly to the hospital of Maadi, a foreigner district of Cairo, on board a helicopter, without being able to speak to the press, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and 'no ransom was paid to the kidnappers', said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna on the roll.
After being taken prisoner on September 19 at an off-road safari at the foot of the Ouanat mountain in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, started the attack at night, just before dawn.
'On both sides were shot and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled, 'said the person in charge who wants to remain anonymous.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade on the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special units have played.
"We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence and the special units," he said without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the day, the Sudanese army had claimed that a patrol had stopped an off-road vehicle in which the kidnappers were, of which six, including the leader from Chad, killed and two were arrested.
The army declared that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which was, however, immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations, or the national historical places that are mercilessly starving?
What politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no real laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only provides 3.5 million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of the cultural heritage is part of the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in a mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the history societies of Quebecs, at least 40,000 volunteers, who are gathered in 211 history societies, are trying to deal intensively with history, to save a few of the many private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when sponsors and decision-makers let go of their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalized parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to take part in the turbulence of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank: the three countries provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the Bank and Insurance Institute, which also has offices in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed at the highest level this weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for Competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in the context of the Bank may have a precedent.
In the light of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three States buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The Bank is likely to sell part of its shareholdings, in particular the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis have started a steep downhill last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios have already emerged.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bust.
The institution's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is due to the downhill of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The money institute was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested party was found with an objective offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should shake for his money, it was said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the bank's branches have not been disturbed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has its own branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken stable
Due to the use of a person's medicine, life and health insurance in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we will entrust the fox with the chickens "- quoted the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the tracking of prescription data.
Insurance shall set the fees and the payment amounts in the event of damage in accordance with the customer's health and, if the risk is too high, the insurance shall not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent for a medical examination and the contract was only concluded in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more favourable method: on the basis of the customer's identification number, he has been using the data from the pharmacies for the last one and a half years, that is, which products were bought, and the program calculates the disease the customer is suffering from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol in lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatably high, which would automatically lead him to a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk ultiplicator, so the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for different purposes, such as migraine and heat flushing, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the above is not.
In order to request and process the data, own companies have formed themselves which, before receiving the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them with the data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient's health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate law on data protection for health data, its effect is only for service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, as the insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are quite somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main issue, along with other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also taking place, which is mainly concerned with cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more votes and say on international issues, but Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of the UN Security Council of New Delhi.
This question was not discussed at the ninth Marseille Summit yesterday.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase it to just over EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that trade in goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement, so that air transport will also be promoted in the future.
By 2009, India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to establish a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one of India, New Delhi is only nine among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Among these were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or the terrorism that both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also considered.
The Doha Round should also be completed, both sides being responsible for the failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India was in agreement with this, as was the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is today visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped that a EUR 20 billion contract will be made to French companies for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and will present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will be represented in the 264 square meters exhibition room "Punto Italia."
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives will be discussed around the publishing industry in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers is decreasing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The small aircraft of billionaire Steve Fossett, which disappeared a year ago, was found again
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The parts were found on a plateau of 3000 m high, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely relieved the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located and a force has been sent to it. Now we have the assurance that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent out a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had started a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of the personal objects of Fosset were found by a couple near their house at the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to round the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stop by plane.
Among his many records is an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls out of the traditional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the exiting surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector with this offroader.
It is precisely because of its exceptional characteristics that the Suv Glk's idea will be unconventional, which will be shown in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
The advertising film, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign - a novelty in the autosector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out by the Corso Como by November 15 in a number of faces that will take the central shopping mile of Milan.
The first fase will consist of the presentation of the car in the form of 3D glasses, which are distributed near the Corso Como, to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to be coming out of the poster on which it is shown.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new glk is illuminated in different moments in all its details, in order to put it back together as a whole.
It is, of course, the concern of Mercedes with this advertising to introduce a new type of car clame into this rather stereotypic field.
But will it succeed in stimulating the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Trivento - now they risk stadion ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia," which has been travelling after the Italian national team for years and which, to be honest, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
There have never been any clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right milieu.
The sponsors are from the Trivento.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia came to Sofia.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Her role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there has now been a clash with a truly right-wing, radical fan scene, that of Levski.
By the Figc, 144 cards were made available to the Italian fans for the game: all of them were issued on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who went to Sofia there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums across Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of impersonators who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be fired immediately, and that in no way gives such a behaviour the opportunity to justify it" is said in the Viminal.
Therefore, "Eyes on especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio, on Tuesday the Casms, can count on a part of the Aise, that is, the secret services that deal with the problem of the stadion force.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, but the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Osservatorio - crimes are punished in the land of their actions.
So far, this group had been in a flaw, but now it has to be considered what has happened and what will happen.
But we are also talking about the ships during the hymn of Mamelis: this is not a crime, but allow me, there is no education.... "
