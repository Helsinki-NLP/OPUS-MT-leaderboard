No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish the provisions on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted in the context of an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned Minister of Expression, was rejected by the Members at the second reading of the request for a reduction in the penalties for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of an allegedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet in force, and in December the appeal of the convicted is to be negotiated in court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as the political revenge of the regime and in the West the trial also made the suspicion of the court's bias rise.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Expression was sentenced, from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As this region usually does, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council was committed to the law of habit of the Scharīʿa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because in short, you cut off your hand for theft.
Women should also forget about emancipation as soon as possible, possible renegades of faith are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Koran in the future by the tribes of each other.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that would be difficult to imagine and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libya.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could even be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To her excuse, it may only serve the fact that NATO's air attacks were not led by any general from America, but by God himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a change of fire, served the interests of Islam and our politicians left the person of the dictator of a political ally without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the hasty are rid of a concern - the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at the mockery price even without occupation?
It is hardly possible, and so the West can at last boast with the right of its selflessness in the field of the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Scharīʿa representatives.
The beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm had to take place through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
However, the obligation market is now ripping all records.
The investors are not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5% and by 0.4% for France.
Both countries also corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of 0.1%), while France recorded a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only mentioned stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, in comparison with the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and according to Tsch. the statistical office confirmed the trend of the slowdown in economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro-zone as a whole and in the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of the analysts.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds was 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The rate of return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, there are voices that the ECB should become a creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1: 0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The selection of football has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
She won 1-0 in Montenegro, thanks to a well-established goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent gate by Petr Jiráček.
With a great portion of luck the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and once again will not be missing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also won a very happy 1: 0 win thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the football EM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they were able to put more pressure on the Montenegrinians only in the second half of the year.
The birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who had two huge chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be part of the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that the national football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes on, quite fighting football was played.
Both teams combined for a long time and so was played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, the pressure of the home crew was also lost and the large cuts in front of the prison area were successfully rejected by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core programme.
They formed a living sign.
Some hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed on Tuesday noon in front of the object and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of the Iranian Isfahan formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to make it known that they are ready to protect their country's core programme, if necessary, also with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seems to have not given up its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
Israel, too, is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack that is intended to slow down the Iranian nuclear programme as far as possible, according to the Israeli press, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan would also be the target of the attack from the centre in Isfahan.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: it does not eat breakfast and eats sausage for the evening
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9% of all pupils and 5% of all children overweight.
Current surveys have shown - obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the milieu in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
There are up to half more sausages on the table on the tables of adipous children than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had fries for dinner on the day before the reconnaissance action under the motto "obesity is not a coincidence."
In families with thickets, sport is not exactly one of the favorite jobs, but the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find their time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from primary schools being interviewed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Obesity is not a coincidence," supported by the General Health Fund and the Unilever Society.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from the 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and a lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frightening increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children interviewed led, for example, five times a day, in the mode of eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-dinner - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," one of the survey results is.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative little things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast for themselves.
The worst thing was the statement that is not breakfast at all in every tenth family.
Breakfast is considered the foundation of the healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that the families of overweight children often use unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed are sports, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own menu from offered opportunities for appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite spas were many flour dishes, meat dishes and of course sweet dishes.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades," is stressed in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, that is, the main dish, pasta was just in front of poultry.
The children almost didn't like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In many cases, the control group of the respondents who completed the questionnaire at the end of the" obesity is not a coincidence, "has seen a significant shift in preferences to healthy nutrition principles," is mentioned in the results of the project.
At the moment, for example, this was the case with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed poultry or fish much more often in the questionnaire as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Proclaiming professionals - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn stylists, I had a little tattled that it was a little too much stuff for the beginning.
I had no idea what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" is going.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the test is, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportional figure.
And that's most of us.
Some have a too short neck, others have a too young figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to cover wide shoulders visually, to extend the neck or to create the necessary curves.
We also received tips on how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - with large breasts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-stressed without it acting too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hip is so large that the skirt or the pants really don't fit, you should at least be cut one piece to a measure.
I'm sure you won't regret that, because well-sitting clothes are just priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the bars, which always slips up and down, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, construction, applications, embroidery or raffation.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad I have a whole week to let everything go through my head.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the light of the homework.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity for which she should think out suitable outfits - day clothes and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I'm supposed to "put on" Miranda Kerr you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I am happy, because this is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the 100 kilos in recent times (well, that's a little overstated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the Internet, print them and then process them graphically.
In the "moodboard," as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist does not only attract the models physically, but also design the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific requirements, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about the types of figures, was immediately spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to use it.
And integrated stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to pull up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks very different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But I was most pleased with the following advice: "First you must know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we have to pause all these textbooks, what you can combine with what, and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothes than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to steal at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different from what is actually in reality.
So you have to count on all this in the design of the outfits.
The fact that image and Styl sometimes account for half of the success was also confirmed by Jan Pokorný.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also well-known personalities often think this is money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if one of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will, with great probability, impose on us a very different (smaller) size than he or she needs in reality.
Then you only need to google to find out with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has again increased or lost, etc.
On Sunday, Jan and Mario set us in the heart of not believing that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "build up" the outfit.
In his work, he must communicate mainly with the people he styls and he must be a well-known psychologist.
I would like to point out that the Commission is not in a position to take a decision on this matter.
"If some manager orders us to see her closet and to add pretty pieces, we can't clean her out and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us in a very concrete way what must include such a so-called "space bag."
So this is a bag that you pull at the waist and carry with you all the necessary proprietas.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, scissors to remove hair or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips that can be used in the back of the clothes if it is too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing tools.
But so that we not only need to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to really stick shoes.
Even when taking pictures in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We were stuck and we were stuck...
With the scissors you can't even touch the shoes, so you can't damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without any restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we got to hear on the second weekend course.
One thing has become clear to me now - to devote yourself to styling on a professional level is not a piece of cake.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettantian errors for the routine journey to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfil the ambitions for the most part, what's the use of it when obviously no one was in the mood to do a little more.
Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the year-old "Need for Speed" game series back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he actually did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the adapted passages are, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are already used to it at NFS, in the end, much is different than you had expected.
Of course - it is potentially quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some unnecessary errors that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of a in principle imperceptible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting ways.
You don't have a moment of the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments can be seen in a very pretty way, even though the technical level of the graphic does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the journey through the desert, through the autumn landscape or high up through the deep-snow landscape, is visually very pleasant.
Every now and then, untypical elements bring a little change in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert tower that restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, one must take care of the hell that one is not spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
It's just a few, but it's enough.
For a while, you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stop clock), then you still expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And for that, the police are also interfering, who wants to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty is the passage where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations where Jack is fleeing from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (in concrete terms only three).
In the end, this is more to the advantage of the matter, because this element has at least no chance of getting boring - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model is in the footboards of the previous parts.
In other words, from today's point of view, it does not tear out trees, but on the other hand it could not be said that it is bad.
If you're looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model will continue to be quite fair to an action-charged race, even though one could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in good order.
Real problems only come up after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
It's hard to expect a game of this kind to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you don't know how the car behaves before any impact on any object, it's obviously not all right.
Typical example: When the car is overtaken or passed by the car, it is only easy to "strip" the other car in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the slingshot and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car is about to go to pieces.
Thanks to the Restart system, it doesn't matter any more, it's always annoying.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then the game throws you back to the last point of view of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
When you have exhausted it, it all starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more of a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you don't have to rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart does not even help, there is nothing else but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
In other places you always meet in the same configuration at the appropriate place "civil" cars, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent comes by two coming cars before you play, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The counterparties have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken in the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard for the time.
This is the most crazy thing to do at the end of the game on the long bridge that is happening in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously overtake you here to the devil.
And if he's already in front of you, he'll take the view of you, of course, so that you start driving your own car in Kump a few times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it will quickly deprive you of the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is generally quite entertaining and sometimes so active that you almost don't know where your head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what's "to blame" - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car during the races.
One must not miss the gas stations on the track, because it is right here that you can change the car, although in most cases the car that you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of game history goes also the task mode (challenges) - the races in the individual locations you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for the own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to get to the higher level of the driver, different objects have to be opened: from the car, to the background for the profile.
This is connected to the online autologue function, which, among other things, compares its own results with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the other ununderstandable cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (because of me), where you ride on the rails in the dark (because of me).
On the tacho there are numbers between 150 a 200 km / h (because of me), but there comes a subway from the back and drives a uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial office we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is not a major but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the repetitive frequency is getting slower and this is sometimes rather dramatic.
This, however, is particularly true of the accidents involving a large number of people, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to address a scale as wide as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "of everyone" was created - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not reduced by the total unnecessary errors mentioned, we could have said with the chest tone of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks kind of unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to make these mistakes with the power of airport lights in your eyes.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the various institutions feel unbalanced."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn. "
"It will take five or six years for the waves to be smoothed and all to be used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite strongly her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her speech, in which she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied some of the lecturers of the Charles University's Faculty of Law.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism was made that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who had not grown up to such a role, but I must say that it has swallowed everyone's breath, how well he has taken care of it.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas of how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, she then explained in response to the question: who is it actually - the European Union? What number should I call? ', that is, as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil-cap quarrels
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda for the European Union to live and to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and had also held the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency was described as a major negative, which had greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is now full of hands.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was quite hectic not only in the Presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome today.
And the EU's seven-year budget must be approved, which makes it much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it is a slender and economical budget, which sectors are given priority, which countries are more and which are less supported - all of this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligible about Europe."
"If I don't like something, then it's horrible words, words and jargon that no one understands.
How can I, as a citizen, know whether we are really thinking of crooked or round cucumbers and different large bananas in Brussels, or whether someone really wants to ban us from the quarrels?
It would also have liked to have used the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in the future
In the opinion of the EU ambassadors, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive side of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a pole or an ungar comes to me and a Slovak is near me, the Frenchman next to me is saying," Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again? "and it makes a pretty sour face.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU will in future expect above all tough rules for Member States' budget policies.
As much more real, as a "European Federation," it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"Here we have the countries of the euro area and the countries off the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to work together and those who do not want to do so should be quiet."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong" Europe of different speeds, "Ms Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also recognised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM is the most accurate, that would probably be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, even though it has been a century since its foundation.
The basis for this longevity already laid its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson senen.
He already represented the slogan that countless global problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark in order to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the well-prepared company culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century, because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us, over the course of our first century, to transform the technologies, the business and also the society.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Integrated system
In the 1930s, Watson had already taken social care of his employees - in a similar way to that of the entrepreneur Baźa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had a paid holiday as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as a work clothing and a well-thought-out pay system for the best newcomers and dealers.
The long-term relationships of IBM with its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was, from the very beginning, brilliant in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan, at the head of IBM, will be replaced by a woman next year - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of the Vetriebs-, marketing and strategy leader.
In recent years, IBM has made so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations come.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, as the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of consulting company Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called "Big Blue" because of family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies in the world - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
IBM has the most patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, vending machines, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or the diskette.
With about $220 billion in market value (market capitalisation), IBM was the second largest technology company this year (right after Apple), with it overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The view ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - for example, the attempt with their own OS / 2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
In the profits of IBM, most of the services, software and hardware are involved in one fifth each.
In 1990, hardware with a more than 50% share was still the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-making assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time was a storm over the world.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the middle of the great world economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM has survived the current crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's net profit is growing continuously.
IBM's company slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values are not.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to all-round flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, had a very complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was only taken over in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later company IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous prick card watches to register the start and end of the work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Rantett Flint, who was also the chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson was the head of the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began to manufacture and sell all possible machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash.
In the first four decades of Watson's leadership, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he was in the head chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped to lead NASA flights to space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System / 360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business with high value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of "Smart Planet."
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a wise way in areas not even planned so far, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help dealers run the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - as the first country ever in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe headquarters are located in Prague and there is also a top research team from the world level that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtáň (53) had become their lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rosary dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for further life it has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová, the singer I Bartošová, had offered refuge in her own house, she would not have even thought of how to do this with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth to říčany after 30 days, Joseph went with him.
Yes, he even publicly announced that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, and it even seemed as if she wanted to make up for her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář it doesn't matter who his wife is sleeping with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly receive at home not open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain ties," said Ms. Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted on the only mutual respect.
The fact that Darina has locked his back door has so far been with Joseph's dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes that."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'll make the purchases."
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, but we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all the responsibility.
The worst female unvirtuous, what about you?
When you ask the men to name some typical female unvirtuous, they shake out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitter revue pass again, which let the men put the blood in the veins?
Purchasing power
Does their husband accuse them of being a good-for-sale?
Do you have to buy at least one Hader a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more in action?
Then I guess your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping pleasure under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman can stand to go through a dress shop in search of a well-sitting upper clothing and not to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times they've told your husband?
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to take at least five kilos - should I start to jogge or do gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that look familiar to you?
Yeah?
Then you must be one of the women who is really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when your wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger gender is in agreement - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly unbearable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and at least twice a week.
Do you chirp with your partner because he is trampling on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, you shudder the children, because the just shredded sink is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where the polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance," then you should know that you must not overdo anything and the order and cleanliness in family life are not the first place.
This extravagant filth of purity can ultimately also damage the mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Stitches
"Dirty sneakers come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you must not be surprised that this will put him on the palm.
Of course it's not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have to complain so much.
gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, and they are scouted behind their backs, or they are slandered, or they make alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to go through such issues, such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
I guess each of us women has a little harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand on the heart - this is probably the own of all women.
But this is not to be confused with clutches of the greatest calibers, to whom nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and who, especially for women's collectives, present a significant danger.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia to win with their assistants
Jarmír Jágr is a professional ice hockey team based in the U.S. state of Carolina, with two assists in the NHL's 5-3 win.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called the best player of the match, was the beneficiary of the review of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey team.
Two assists in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr claimed to journalists that he had prophesied a big evening to Giroux.
"Even before the game, I tell him that he is able to do a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that. "
"Once in a while, such a feeling happens," said Jágr, after his action, Giroux already scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit had "a Czech lead."
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third's shooting, the home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-dealer, but the second third was the Flyers again.
Concretely, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he scored his third hit, and then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's probably one of the best three," Jágr paid tribute to his center.
"I would not have thought of playing with such an ice hockey player as I did with him at the end of my career."
"I'm so glad."
"I'm cutting my game towards me."
"All these years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the skewer is turning around," Jágr shunned.
Carolina made game a drama - with the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who went through a penalty, came up to a goal.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complication, in which he was in overnumber two against one.
"Pronger still acted very well in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory led Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenceman of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured in the game against Buffalo and left in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also lost their leadership in the Penalty shooting 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not turn one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team probably the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defensive players to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only played the meeting with a single experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to be done, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here, "said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec fought thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters were involved.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies sold only travel to the socialist East Bloc countries, and to the West at that time only chosen ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A simple exception was the period 1962-1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the Eastern bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovakia) to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
It was a long way from the point of view of the matter.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange agreement it would have been impossible to obtain the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a journey to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, of which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted to the neighbouring Western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone at least wanted to have been there a few days.
For example, the Czech vacationers slept in the tent in the park when travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of the trip abroad from Czech was a trunk packed with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely replaceable Czech krone - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of living and, as a result, the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare regular travel through charter flights after 1997, which made it possible to negotiate volume discounts, which was an incredible reduction compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, already had unsolicited payments with all the world's highly developed countries, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-velvet" travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was made to Thailand thanks to the high demand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft have been flying every year with Czech passengers in far-away sunny countries; this year, you can fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
To the 100 thousand Czechs travel every year to exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch, which marked our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely led our country to join the world's highly developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 thousand CZK per capita for a single holiday stay including the cost of the holiday.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a patent is under threat.
For almost five months now, Czech football has no chairman, and the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
In fact, there is still no agreement on the electoral order.
And without this, no vote is possible at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, asking his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality who could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old querels broke out again between the two chambers of association, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the general meeting had come to the people's house in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the trial did not result and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or even the officials with a full power.
At least in part agreement was reached on this single point, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion was not acceptable to be represented on a power-based basis.
However, the disputes over the electoral order continue.
The Executive Committee also did not bring any more clarity to the matter, and in principle nothing else is on the agenda at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round in order to avoid a face-to-face situation?
"The point of dispute concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the Statutes or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in the management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for whom he is a candidate will win.
Moravia is supposed to be willing to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, on the other hand, is on the condition that the winner will receive at least one-third of the vote in this percentage.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer have any sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would be best placed not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to the valid statutes.
Tomáš Paclík is surprised to agree, even though it is clear that the statutory electoral order is most likely to meet Pelta by all the candidates.
"My wish is to be elected as much as possible according to the statutes."
"In order not to make up for any unwise alternatives, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who was running for the first time and in his comments, especially against Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM today would certainly help to calm down the minds."
"If the football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to work together is also greater," says the Jablonec official, who brings with him the greatest experience of all three adopts, and this at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to" bend "the rules for their own purposes.
"Therefore a new blocking at the general meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will ultimately win," said Rajchl.
Only - there is no longer much time to agree on all sides.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete at all until the qualification game.
The charter aircraft, with which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning because of a technical disturbance and so one was feverishly looking for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage play.
After all, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is probably crucial.
Josef Dobeš, Minister for Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have the parties divided within the country's largest sports association to reach an agreement.
In fact, there is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the confidence of Czech football and the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which will lead the Czech sport in the light of the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes to the fight for the position of the president because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football team before the extraordinary general meeting, could have made a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have been in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favorite of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to perform the role of chairman for only one year, that is until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who is not too involved in the football event.
"I spoke to some of the people in question in person."
"It's hard to believe that some of them told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly dislikes the connection between Pelta's and the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation, who is considered to be a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes on general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta had the position of president.
"In his victory, the present state would be preserved and in Czech football it would not be possible at all."
"The support from Berbr, a smart businessman, would be twice as bad for football," Paclík stressed.
He is also referring to the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone calls to investigate corruption, but from which Pelta was found to be a criminal.
"I do not know which prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to the (sch.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier saying, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees something more relaxed.
However, if Paclík were to win in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is true of another candidate - Rajchl, who Paclík had supported before the October general meeting, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could think of him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as a manager."
"I am not in my nose in matters that I do not understand," said Paclík, who in September had made it clear that he was the head of the referee's commission with Luđěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he is growing in the role of the President of the Association.
He is also the head of Pilsen since last summer, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, what is going on in the past," said Paclík, who does not make any sense of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
One of his priorities would be to strengthen the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would praise political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to sport.
"This is one of the key things the new chairman should be dedicated to."
"When it comes to the taxation of lucky games, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they also have to say very clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection with the Pilsner Club also does not consider Paclík to be a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "superparty."
In turn, Pelta is connected to Jablonec, and Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares to a third party at the Pilsner Club in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will unravel a patt situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election he would make a strong commitment to the fact that the FAČR will be given new statutes which will in future rule out disputes over the electoral order.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly disarm in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Before the unrealised election in September, Pelta promised to focus on the national team and the acquisition of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting and so the two-month break helped him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was run by someone, the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today's problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the general meeting in June, statutes were approved which were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September, "said Pelta.
In particular, he used the revision of the most important document of the civil union as a means of loosening the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take this personally and I am willing to be personally responsible if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental thing he cannot be without," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to separate himself from his opponents.
In the past, he had announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognized because of his legal education, and he well knows that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who left no dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes. "
"However, his attacks were degrading and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"For this reason too, many now doubt his real character," addressed Pelta to his opponent, who probably remains true to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the bottom classes to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the sustainability of the corruption scandal from last year."
"Right after that, I would throw myself into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean human cleansing.
"I would have to get familiar with the work content of all the employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, as a result of the long anarchy, there is a sense of nervousness.
Despite the depressing catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only controversial point is how to vote in the third round, we can get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it only gains it back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, it would be said that many people in the Association would be in the mood.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemian, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and, otherwise, to continue the work that the former president Ivan Hašek has started.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, through the national selection, professional football, to the performance football for the youth. "
"I don't want to say I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will give out hard tasks so that football in every segment can move forward with miles of steps. "
Many would not be very pleased about this, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it had been considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who do not ever throw billets between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would."
"This is trust that can't be played off," he said.
It is said that he is also motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a great deal of work and I do not want to throw that away."
"Processes have been launched that are likely to come to light only in a few years and I would like to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and this is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"There are people behind him who would make the football so that it would only be there for the chosen."
I can probably be accused of a few things, but not that I am a party. "
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for all, because then everyone is doing well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl noted.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which then each went into the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the fight for the role of the president, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-president and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of million crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the Lottery Act as its success.
On the other hand, he is partly responsible for the fact that the association is not in a single line.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to give the Czech football a new confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate, who really has something to offer to the football.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he was elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek started and the staff in the commissions would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to bend things in his favour, "says Rajchl about his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Statek
Paddling pools in Ufo-Optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike, the tired legs rest in sprinkling pools.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip over the past one and a half years, one in her luggage could not be missing: her bathing suit.
Lying back on the water, she looked high in artfully designed domes, she swam in front of marble-putts waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and amazed at the acrically restored Art Nouveau pools.
If she found a bath, she took it in flight in her notebook - with good details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her recent book "Bathing Freiden": Volksswinhallen in Munich, historical swimming palace in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sport, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
The only thing that is annoying is that swimming fans have to get away with blue tiles and chlorinated stink, while joggers can breathe in the bewitching scent of spruce forests or listen to happy bird-wits in the park.
"I was wondering one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
In the spring pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all the senses are served, Meder says.
And when the builders have made a lot of effort, swimming halls can be a real touch of eye: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture book "Bahnfreiden" provides information on the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes the desire for a jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens in her research in Hungary.
In addition to the magnificent healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found a nitrates-containing water in an ancient Karst cave (a cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, the basin of which is filled with alkaline water and located in a bottle-like building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While one has in mind the whole city from the Zurich Dachbad, one can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which one can watch the driving on the ski slopes.
The most extraordinary pool design, perhaps, awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three up-open bowls it steals in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Oetztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine rose in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so much of fuel oil, which is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogencarbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slag is stuck to the skin as soon as you can slip into the pool - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sun swimming pool in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, the fall has been counteracted by a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of the construction have already been completed; it is possible to discover not only neoromaniac elements that come from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of the pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it was originally from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge such different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is obviously only a side thing.
Agrar speculation
Deutsche Bank makes raw material business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its business in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group will then want to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
The matter is clear to the federal citizens: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges are increasing prices - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similar.
Initially, raw material betting was intended to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the zackers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest make profits.
Unlike US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business is "worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank's Board of Directors - including a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank's head will tell you what its consequences are.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete reversal.
Ackermann works on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The bet on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how ruthless banks today damage the general good."
Ackermann is now the top banking lobbyist in particular.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all the assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the group would like to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that, unlike planned, the head of the board will not change to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from the controversial agrar speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make a possible loss, he hardly needs to be shredded - his successor would have to do with that.
Each second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is therefore only 11% that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that are bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they found out that their bank is involved in such transactions: according to the survey, each second would terminate all the facilities where money is in the commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said to think about quitting their account and moving to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The inverted pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and verkam.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
When it is heated by modern post-war architecture, by clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is an excellent and famous example for the Brüssler World Exhibition 1958.
At that time, Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating-looking steel-glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Pavilion at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus shesselarte side building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station, the pavilion was planned as a temporary exhibition, and a museum of the 20th century opened in 1962 - the "20's house" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable for space and technical use as a museum - no walls for the hanging of art, no good climate.
However, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has redesigned the pavilion, it is now called the "21st House" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a case of luck in every respect.
The new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Huslein-Arco, a PhD in art historian with a significant career, was a young figure-skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, made a strong contribution to the transformation of politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship funds and established the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation, Kishanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna had been sensitively redesigned and expanded and won the competition, but because he studied at the University of Vienna in Schwanzer and the pavilion was a "huge important place" for him, where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in generosity and lightness during his transfer to Vienna and its use.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy slingshot," says Kishanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fibre-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold-bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two lower floors brought space for the new use, a sewn-down light ditch between the house and the street provides for exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original outside doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust-protection-color.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the memorial authority and with a small budget.
"It was often necessary to find a material that was good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and changes, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion "who came from Brussels," Kishanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city history."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "raise a real consciousness."
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it has been a case of urban success: around the Swiss garden, the completely new planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier," with office and residential houses is being created.
And another case of luck may still occur: the 21-year-old house could get reinforcements from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall and, as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn, according to a newspaper report, is spending more than 70 million euros in addition this year.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance on the basis of a group-based crisis plan that by 2015, investments of around EUR 300 million were planned.
The aim is to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the internal and external employees for the snow disposal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim was to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary operating options.
Two months ago, after a high-level meeting with the government and industry, railway head Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the rail in the passenger transport sector had considerable problems, as it was lacking in reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making it possible for years to have the axles of ICE trains tested more frequently in the workshop, after an ICE in the Cologne main station had an axis break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in the USA
After the tumult of Chief Josef Ackermann, new unchamber comes from the USA: the Deutsche Bank has to pay a million penance there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now still taking up its past in the US: the Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of having misled the cooperative banks with false promises for the purchase of financial products, which would have played down the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and brought the banks into the deep.
"We are satisfied that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of 20.5 million dollars.
The NCUA president, Debbie Matz, welcomed the meeting of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and is in charge of the Pleiten to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the resulting billion-dollar damage replaced.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also taken on other large banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage documents in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on house loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, a large number of financial companies have lost it.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though the events have been over a few years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought innumerable complaints to obtain redress or to punish misdeeds.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wand.
It charges 18 large international banks to have outsourced two state-owned US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions of around $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to face a complaint from the FHFA, which is about several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Office to be responsible for "substantial losses," but not to mention an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unreservedly and declared to be willing to defend itself.
Warren Buffett is entering IBM with 10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought up more than $10 billion in shares.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett has always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies is bad to predict.
However, he has now read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offered services and provided computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knights' strike in the financial world.
As a result, the IT-Urstein IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM."
Because Buffett has now revealed in the US-based CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus become one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which, even in the economic crisis, had provided for proper profits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centres for some time now.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett, for example, was able to access a cargo cable track, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway has in addition to some 80 own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Ruch.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it to one of the world's most valuable companies with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost undeceptive sense of money-making has given him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the launch of the Buffett investment, IBM's share increased by one percent on the pre-exchange basis.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, is worth over $220 billion on the stock exchange and is one of the world's most valuable technology companies, together with Apple and Microsoft.
In Microsoft, Buffett said, however, he did not want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-based and one Greek small-scale entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being addressed with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, a long-established ghost is returning: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is an xenophobia of foreigners in Germany was never in question.
The right-wing extremist network, however, reveals dimensions, the dimension of which is far from foreseeable.
"Does the bloody ideology live up again?" headlines the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing-wing swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted in a very good way: on the weekend, it reminded the victims of racist violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate with a vigil.
Only two weeks before, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, the collaboration had been staged - as a story of success.
The report of some Turkish media works like a slap: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which refers to the background of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this spiritual connection.
"It's starting to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the action of the police and their later search success is discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised why the German authorities had not thought of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some of them are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: "If they continue to be slaughtered, there is nothing left for migrants but self-defense and arms."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The inner peace in Germany depends very much on the goodness of the enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen."
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties made clear.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the we-feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly lamented: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen he sent a condolences program to the Turkish President, but at the funeral ceremony in Cologne he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many charges the local Turks did.
It's like a person's value is calculated by the amount of his tax.
The current coverage of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks into the local rule of law has been.
In addition to the efforts of a large-scale education and reassessment of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since been running from one crisis to the next.
Now I want a German to judge it.
I'm sure that's not how Axel Weber thought it was.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased in public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its new soundness and made friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be very different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and smeared around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS head of the board Oswald Grübel, a banker not only appointed in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been considered to be hit - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It was already announced that Weber was allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he is already taking over the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and a banker of notes and would certainly have needed a time of integration.
With one blow, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it has long been entitled "Europe's largest scandal bank."
The UBS is, on the one hand, huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager - and on the other, it has been skipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is saved from the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
The UBS had an excellent reputation until 2007.
She had combined the image of the Swiss asset manager, who was still silent and solid, but also well-balanced, with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a big number in investment banking.
In 2007, the UBS managed more wealthy customers than any other bank in the world with $1.6 trillion.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it was advanced into the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-term bank professor Hans Geiger in Zurich tells: "I always put the UBS on the table as a model of a good bank to my students at that time."
"From today's point of view one wonders: how could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something of a relative slate in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, the head of the board, Peter Wuffli, resigned surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had left.
The bank's investment sector had been teased with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
In fact, it found investors, but some of them, through which some of them would have had their noses up to a short time ago, an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so silent that you didn't even know your name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, and President Marcel Ospel, the second best-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS had to be saved by the state in the face of its misinvestment in the financial crisis.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced-wanderbond, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"Once again we could not save the UBS," says bank-researcher violinist.
The second was followed by the first disaster.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who might have been able to deduct taxes from the bank.
It also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions and a penalty.
In this way, the UBS was more or less open to helping with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
For example, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both key business areas: investment banking through misspeculation and asset management through aid for tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter, just as you thought the UBS was going to get it right now, this unblissful dealer story follows: a single dealer is going to get 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going to go wrong.
And it is obvious that risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"The Adoboli case has made it clear that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's bank institute.
The financial board of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was the very idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had taken a long time ago to become the guardians of the great assets of the world: no too big risks, no security for money, for that - the world could collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss banks' safes had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fit the cliché of the well-known Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Züricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to the Zürichsee, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rent is one of the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops like the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have been here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to the elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception room is entered through a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marble-lined, there are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe."
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point it has been pushed out - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he is also doing business with the two large banks.
The UBS had become far too big, he found - especially in the investment banking, where the fishing sachsen would have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxon."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, first gave its high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15th, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"That Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author of Luke Häsig in his book "The UBS Crash."
Up to 68 billion Swiss francs or about 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save the large bank that was before the bankruptcy.
How could it come to that?
When talking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined together to form a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
This helped the two different precursor banks of the UBS to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came to a lot of money to make a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, the humble, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked up from the bank to the top."
But Ospel had finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that pride came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, at which Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: to push Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the ranking lists, which documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go to the top.
A few steps were already successful.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she was at the top of the list.
However, business consultants, who were appointed, highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "fixed income," there was a huge distance from the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime facilities.
It developed into a huge machine that packed and passed on securities on American mortgage loans - but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become a sling seat and are still wobbly.
Those who lead the big bank now have an almost impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the close business models.
Bank-researcher violinist already has an idea: stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink a lot, so much is already clear.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world next Thursday.
The 51-year-old Italian Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from the previous Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is to keep the business of UBS on a permanent basis, told the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to its position in the mid-1990s.
He's taking out 3500 jobs.
That's not gonna be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably already asking.
In public, he only says so far that he will first find an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe is burdened by US stock exchange
The imminent recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The threatened industrial production on the continent has stifled the hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been half-full last week, not half-empty, but now the problems came to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales tables.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values noted at the end of the trade with a minus of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer reached between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wider S & P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent with 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is looking forward to the end of the recovery.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as Eurostat reported.
The US investors were sceptical about this: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe would not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there were further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early, in his view, to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment in IBM for more than $10 billion supported the share price of the traditional company and had it recorded at first just under one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
According to its own data, Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's shares were at 2.6 percent much stronger than the market.
The house is going to lose almost the rest of its shares in China Construction Bank, and it's going to take $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the institution wants to pamper up its capital ratio and thus meet more stringent regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share gained 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order of its history.
On Sunday, Airline Emirates ordered 50 type 777 long-distance machines and estimated the value of the order to be 18 billion dollars.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, some 710 million shares changed owners.
719 values increased, 2281 passed and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq, with sales of 1.38 billion shares, 630 in the plus, 1913 in the minus and 82 remained unchanged.
Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the city's image for centuries, but in many municipalities there are problems with housing over the dirt and noise of the animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seeds crow can no longer be found out from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian emptiness.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible routes.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
The problems in cities were also caused by the land-run of the particularly protected seed cages: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing construction and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are under nature protection.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs, among others in the West Fédéral Soest, in the North-West among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had provided negative headlines.
Critics had referred to the catching of the animals in bird traps and the beating with billets as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the gardening, is of no use," said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Nester with water or trees fall, often have undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals evade, large colonies split and spread in other places."
It is only possible to provide for the exception of hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
The problem in the cities cannot be solved without the surrounding area, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of the animals' gearing from sensitive residential areas and relaxation offers is possible to relocate them in other places.
The psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, promoted "information boards instead of chain saws," for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "After all, we can bear a pimple in the face in the best self-confident way."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Kähen-Lehrpfad, on which information on the life of the highly intelligent seed crows was provided.
The project is already being adopted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows not only use tools to get to a treat, but even make their own tools as a tool.
Behaviour researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the extent to which the intelligence of the birds is sufficient.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crash a scaffolding with stones in order to get to a moth larve.
Without much training, they realized the size and shape of a stone in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the creepy crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larve.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid down wire pieces for them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then applied the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crow even achieved this at once.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Year
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup have not been met.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also present at the 2012 EM.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 52.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and after the 0: 0 out of the play made the fifth in a row a perfect EM participation.
The Czechs had a 1: 0 (0: 0) in the play-off play-back at outsider Montenegro, after the play-off (2: 0) had already been a clear thing.
There was nothing more to burn in the 0: 0 against Turkey, and Ireland brought a loose 1: 1 (1: 0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trading meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red map (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a step-by-step start.
Ronaldo took a free kick of about 30 meters to the early lead in the mash.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-shot qualities and met from 25 meters to 2: 0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance by goalhunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburg of the English table leader Manchester City put a head ball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the gate line (33.).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
The focus was then on referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian criminal area, Stark decided on Swalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth year in a row for the European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionären Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg), however, was also lucky and had to survive a terror second in the initial phase.
The closing man Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible self-gate by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo was Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
In the 40th minute, Damjanovic shot out of the turn from the penalty line only close to the gate of Cech.
After the break the cross-latte had to save the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of the FC Seoul had taken off (50.).
The gate just before the end made it all clear.
In the meantime, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get beyond 0: 0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to leave almost safely his place in the bank of the World Cup third in 2002, the Croats may be pleased about their fourth participation in an EM final round.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan only hit the post with a distance shot, and Kazim Kazim was not able to sink the impact in the gate.
After the terror, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for the Dormunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga-Legionär Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the play, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) was suitable for the guests.
Ireland pressed at the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible lead hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an accident at the end of the war, he was replaced by a 1-0-1-0-1-0-1-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer, SAP, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, some two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," announced co-boss Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500.
The number of branches of the world market leader for business software will double from five to ten or 11.
So far SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's over 176 000 SAP customers are in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the 2015 strategy of the Dax Group.
SAP wants to increase its sales to EUR 20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer had saved about EUR 12.5 billion.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55 000 people worldwide, is running almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous, Peter Engmund's new book "Beauty and Horrors. A History of the First World War, Telling in Nineteen Fates" begins with a long list of main people who go to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in England's romantic story very well, and these main people will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you, like England's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he does not incorrectly describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are few ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Horrors" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the Votive Candles in a church, some are added while others are extinguished.
Engmund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war on the West Front.
"Beauty and Horrors" is a journey through the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa with an expert view of other war scenes.
The soldiers in this book are beehives, one of them celebrating Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war overcomes the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, who smells of Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and can hear cannon fire in the distance.
Who's even coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is even being fought.
"Missing facts," says Englund, "have been made up with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and Horrors" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be frightening or gripping, but they are extremely alive in the englands of the collection of small moments lost in details.
Many of them are about lack and abiding.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the saving process in Germany.
It describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and was last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes that were beamed with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, in spite of everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in your hand, and to do so as if such a facade meant civilization and as if there was no barbarism behind your own strengthened and impoverished shirt breast."
On the other hand, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you distance yourself from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word of winged and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the suit of measure, who slaughter while he is sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there are as much frivolous behavior as heroin.
Englund talks to the soldiers who were actively trying to get infected with a sexual disease in a prostitute to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with Gonococca-Eiter, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to come to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate put him in the eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englunde's poetry becomes supple and unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually rather distorted like Paul Fühl's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West" than extensive history books.
Englunds Band joins an unconventional hall of glory.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book of fact.
I'm not giving it back.
But it's like he took this side with the main people in front of us with his book and lit it with a match.
After an early failure, a minutiously planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed, and all the others initially believed that they would take part in an exercise.
The police president Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence stressed the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past weeks, such as the use of pepperspray against protesters, which is contrary to the rules of the December, and which brought a huge increase in public sympathies to the occupants of the house, were no longer allowed to be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupation was handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials increased the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the orders, which spoke of a declaration as "exercise."
"The few police who were involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-level officials of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then left, when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including mission teams from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials, who are normally used in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and go out in the park, almost like commuters, so that 1 am at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were available in front of the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that drifted out of the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials invaded the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply put their things together and left the place.
The police said that until 1: 45, no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene if arrests in the park were to be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police president, said that this had been done for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to be prevented from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the handling of the officials was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street could have taken pictures on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the big mess of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags with clothes, their staff followed the city cleaning, which lifted what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the camp's epicentre joined their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials have been called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until 3: 30.
According to the police, the eviction was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, as he said, were due to "undue behaviour and resistance to a arrest."
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence, "Mr. Kelly" did not lead the operation, "as Mr Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials was waiting on the eastern side of Broadway between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police continued to expand the perimeter around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, a number of officials, many of them with protective signs, were observed to drive people out.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At about 5 o'clock south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let the air out of the ripening of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of carers will file a complaint against the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who have lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, because the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The action is probably the last opportunity that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-two school helpers, care coordinators and other staff who were among the city's worst paid employees and who had lost their jobs in a move on 7 October, have described the trade union leader as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that the working groups had held last year to close the budget gap.
This allegation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of the Schools, said last month that the redundancies had been part of the budget that they had been adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that there was nothing in the budget to specify that school assistance staff would be released.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Ministry of Education before a lawsuit. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the submission of the lawsuit to the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will be directed by Mr. Walcott and the City's Ministry of Education as a defendant and will count eight dismissed workers as a plaintiff, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the City's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in charge of the lawsuit and that the individual claims of the city could not be commented on.
According to a draft lawsuit before the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in the schools in the poor areas of the city to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that, while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school helpers in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 helpers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the assessment of the loss of five out of eight school helpers who were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of bewitched parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced this year by 3.26 percent. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for the extra financing of each school entry.
The union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo which allowed the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "exit" to describe the action, even if "exit" (German: transfer) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's pay list to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the draft claim.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already in agreement on the uprising in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee will decide on a resolution under the authority of the Chairman John Kerry, with Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Joseph I, Lieberman, Connecticut, to praise Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "courage."
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, both parties' legislators and the White House were arguing about the choice of words of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in the NATO Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution that approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate. Furthermore, the board overruled a decision to cut the money for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a convention that was upset enough to criticise Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their self-liberation" and "commends the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in the successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy."
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Panel, or will they split the legislators, as the June Act did?
The last version comes up with the resistance of the senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congress legislature period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or any other area that is currently being voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this Congress and cover a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different.
In the Senate alone, there are at least 15 versions of the compensatory budget change and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners in the Republicans who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids marriage among the same-sex, as well as a change that forbids the burning of flags, is an ever-recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of States reject them.
As eagerly as the members are proposing changes, they are moving as much faster as they have been in recent years.
In the 111. Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments. in the 110. Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Tagged but not defeated," says Giffords in the first TV interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a distance during an election in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Giffford (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night. She sang alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to Congress.
When she and Diane Sawyer appeared on the ABC news "20 / 20," she jumped for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to give her voice to the debt brake in a triumphant manner.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20 / 20" special recorded shortly before the release of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special has been following Gifford's recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to do simple movements.
A nod with a head.
A twitching with the lips.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: You can see how the congressmen sing together with the therapists of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin '."
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read an article to a daily newspaper about the assassination, when she interrupted it and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is forced to receive medical treatment while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say," Gabby, you were not defeated "?" said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you're gonna get through this, and you're gonna recover, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
In a word, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedo got up and applauded.
"The soldiers and female soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising in the spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among others, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The irresistible, contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will be overhauled with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say staff.
The public is increasingly acting as if people were suffering in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of supporting is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in a dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that has hit returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam war was far worse.
As a result, there are talks about compassion in silence and private relations between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, the Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, as they had defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a high state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interrogators asked subtly whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The military's lack of lightness is partly rooted in the American's lack of interest in the war.
A country that has little experience with the military and sees little use in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is rarely used as a praise.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely common in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely concentrated on the suffering of a servant.
Troops are recognized for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
The military is facing the growing pressure to take a hard action on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are being charged for non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
If it does not happen, hundreds of applicants will be ready for the next hearing.
She was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who had a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if he could take her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan put aside her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, come on, he's 19.
He's from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind them, pressed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military workers are anxious to see a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a lawsuit they have brought against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 applicants, but in the following months it increased to 28: 25 women and three men who all claim that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers and that the military failed to identify, condemn or provide appropriate case-law in accordance with the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, because the problem is starting there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retribution? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted almost 400 other survivors, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the applicants putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to dismiss the case.
The court's files, which are available to Newsweek, have detailed the defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for the injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Fees Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on the soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage was caused during the military service of the plaintiffs," says the document.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in fighting.
It is time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her fight: three more charges are pending except for her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four most important military agencies for the alleged promotion of an anti-women atmosphere.
Independent of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is collecting a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," which received rape victims to release them from service - a usual approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (in German: The Administration of the War Veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in its handling of benefits for persons who indicated that she had been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of indications.
In 2010, according to the Ministry of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3.158 sexual abuse was reported.
But most of the abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases covered were brought to court in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six people testified as character witnesses in the name of the alleged offender, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember well the day the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the labor would start. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department, and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander," That was not his procedure. "
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incompetent.
In January 2010, she was dishonorable and received no support.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have submitted is a matter of pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."
What is between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Fees Doctrine for my life.
The military is lagging behind for a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrent that a liability entails.
He adds, "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will start with her hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms are made," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amocle in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on the side of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in on Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, says Bartlett, that the researchers simply need to use the site's advertising pool to precisely define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing extreme groups across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their educational status, their attitude to violence and their assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 very right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's a rather new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of right-wing extreme groups are usually young, male and annoy about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes," text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add on average three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has allowed the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title to increase by almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you usually don't reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have given them access," Bartlett says.
"On Facebook, it all goes away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their full-time on Facebook tend to drink significantly more than students who were silent about this subject.
Moreno suggests that equal-level students, for example, housing consultants, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You cannot solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has produced statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 interim elections and a National Luck Index (mainly using information that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data base mine available for other research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want to or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to provide its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and a lot of social life is still off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two amo-races, in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support Hasideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I do not commit guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to give Breivik the permission to contact the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely control all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he was behind the lock and the bar.
All of them took part with the aim that everything would go to the end.
"I thought he was cold and inhumane," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed quiet and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had had accomplices.
Some may like that the attacks of 22 July were apparently the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But this automatically makes it easier for the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find the most enlightening in the recently discovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film demonstrations in the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and working processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also an acrib organizer who was eager to build diagrams - a man who believed that many managing directors were suffering from "a disease of thought," "that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the departure of the personal computer. And he was sitting with jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, extensive conversations.
At that time, as 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiotes, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
It was only after jobs died that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor extensive interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly eager to explain their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and seek accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatient in responding to Cringley's questions and pushing him to move more quickly on issues or side-actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview seems to be kind of awfully far-sighted when jobs evaluate what other companies do to their opinion right or wrong and his own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous rewards of the career jobs'. But to see jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the jump to grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"All the years in the business, I always ask," Why do you do things? "And the answer you always get is," Oh, that's how it's done. "
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in business really thinks about things in detail.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalise Apple's accounting.
It was amazing how costs were recorded - most of the time it started with "standard costs," which were calculated on a mere assumption, and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - that he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest possible extent.
How the Pope was alarmed:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
A lot has been written about the device, but job enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a fee-based phone, making a call and then connecting from an AT & T network to another, while dragging through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you grilled in the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door," says jobs giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that can control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to speak to the Pope, while they were able to make up for Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came on the phone.
How he fell in love with the technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube, and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some boards, he was asked by a customer to build the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the pervasive arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are falling:
Long before he let Apple live, jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions stumbled and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are they people], which ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly, is eradicated by the people who have no concept in terms of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger if the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You got the defeat of the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to vote, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it's on the taste, it's on the point of trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then trying to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for the computer industry, they would do fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dining with opponents of the health laws, as court takes case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political-sharing question of whether to listen to a challenge to the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case would be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health system, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law that became the key word of the conservative activists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1 / 2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to result in the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer, who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be tilted, will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company, which represents the dinner-type, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
Service, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Group leader in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner?
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of federalist society for years.
And that's not against moral rules.
In fact, judges are free from the code of conduct which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may take part in the benefit events of the law of close and other organizations, with the judge being no spokesman, guest of honor or, according to the programme, no guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas was sufficient to alert two of the firms involved in the case as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this to moral and government activists.
"This astounding break with morality and the contrast to the code is a lie to the lawsuits of some judges, the court adhering to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US.
"The judges won and dined in the court during a benefit event with lawyers with standing proceedings."
Their appearance and support for a donation action for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little insight into critics who say that they would easily mix court matters with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a state attorney under the Obama government, when the first legal claims came to court at first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from the hearing of the case because she was too involved in the defense of the law to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't make any institutions to do this.
Boeing to land record 18 trillion dollars
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 dual-use aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It's really a rare news that a company gets an order for over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is a record total of 18 trillion dollars.
The client of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that in the next 20 years, airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion.
During the weekend, Boeing announced its biggest order for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline has also announced, in 2011, that it will be available at the Dubai Aviation Hall, an option for the purchase of 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered a huge improvement in the fuel consumption and comfort of the passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is more than 1 trillion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but an increase in oil prices, which is usually harmful to the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boing's leadership position in the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in check, which attacks the A350's dominance.
Boing's victory on the airfield comes four months after Airbus has announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed in order to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President seems to lose election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer Fausto Vallejo of the PRI supported in the race for the Governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for the Governor's post in the Western state.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... They occupied election cabins, built road blocks... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just hit Claderon, who had still been in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative Pardo Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently still acting governor, came to number three, a heavy defeat for the split and unlucky left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
For a long time, Michoacan has been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home country and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left the local elections because of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us a brave look at next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economies in the world must do "everything in your power" to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look "unpassionate" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia will help to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest rate costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is a source of fear that the global economy could fall into recession and led to a call for the leading emerging countries to join forces to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from the IMF for Asia will be channeled, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue funds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - will offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power to help the euro zone," as its own economy is now suffering from the falling exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is an order, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, of which more than 800 million are living from 2 dollars or even less a day.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly-run, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011 / now threatens "the risk of classification" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital drain of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in the defense sector
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta heated the Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would unnoticed weaken national security, thus triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the war scene in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already thinking of cuts of $450 trillion in the course of the coming decade, but now it is afraid that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if the Congress is unable to complete its expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to achieve a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stop to many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unthought-of way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unworkable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to unwillingly separate from most of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were finally made by the combat forces, "said Panetta.
"While the war-time quotas in the anti-terrorism struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Staff recruitment has been reduced, which would lead to delays in recruitment and the recruitment supervision that support the war."
"Staff salaries would be reduced, leading to late payments to war-time traders and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure by the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they published Paneta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase the pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts will remain to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible cuts, although he has had many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing serious decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark picture of what could be happening - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade with no ammunition."
"It is an air-force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," said Panetta in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is an armed force that lacks moral and alert and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She actually makes you angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta presented new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global operational and action capacity, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could be the victim of the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground-fighting vehicle, the Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If the further development and the tests of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade so that possible dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to uncover a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lie are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy getting over the allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides lie to each other.
The management of Penn State is accused of perjury, as it is said to have been held back reports that a retired football coach has sexually abused boy.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and troubled countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he put in circulation denials that were very quickly disproved by inviolable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations in the campaign financing that are related to the cover-up of an out-of-marriage affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it, the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating at school and college exams are common.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the examination answers, so that they themselves were well received during their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite will send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, every day we lie between 10 and 200 times.
But many of these lies are considered an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or to "uncover" lies is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as charades, in which it is the aim to call "have you!" the deception of a deception is a serious knowledge area based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths were exposed to lies.
Lies look you in the eyes.
They stutter, they stem, they blush and they don't always zap.
However, it must not be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and to uncover.
A tried-and-tested lie-catcher can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, the question and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of deception, and it is clear that the deception of deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find justice in our complex world, especially if the recruitment or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at judging other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that the extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men tend to "self-oriented" lies on women, whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they say are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person was exposed as a guilty person, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by watching the normal behavior of this person.
It's called "baselining," the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should better know when someone usually tripples with the foot all the time so that they do not blame him unjustly when he tripples with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of the accumulation of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviour.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that are roaring, not as evidence of a deconstruction.
People who are deceiving may stare when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the job interview," this deep, relaxing exhale and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
The questions often incorrectly signal that an employment interview is over, just to look for this relaxation after the employment interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his wife was still alive and that he had a national search for her.

Overrun plan of oil pipeline is revised after risk from delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, with which the trade unions were angered and at the same time the environment-friendly, the pipeline-building company is trying to replan the project so that it can return to normal.
On Monday night, TransCanada said that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will be finally approved, albeit with a different course.
This was followed by an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week that a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of action to avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, after the next year's elections, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Foreign Ministry and agreed to support it.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the Ministry's main auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether one company that was commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused, as she allegedly forced a toddler out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a drug addiction attack that would have scared her little daughter so much that she was afraid.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from "personal changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year, when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went with his luggage and Genevieve on his arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," Yes, "and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone," You should not drop your daughter near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her," I don't care what you say or think. "
She got angry and started to scorn - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tap water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman," See what you did to my daughter, "said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby was screaming so much that it had to give up, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is due to an unspecified compensation, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not charge a fee and that the family would plan to donate the money they received to the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is presented to a child-nurseries woman who has an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate adversity slowed the economy down
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in the government, unemployment and undeclared work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment fell and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who called himself the initiator of change and raised great hopes for economic growth, is in the government. However, as a result of the climatic adversity, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also set close limits to the growth of the state economy and in the first quarter of the year caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6%. This is mainly due to the historical decline of agricultural development by 31.16%, which has had an impact on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on the effects of the frost, published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustainable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a continuous increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geographie observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, as between January and March, 55 053 people in Sinaloa had no employment, equivalent to 4.53% of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28% and from July to September to 6.19%, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The year's unemployment in Sinaloa is due to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment, which is related to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts in money laundering legislation adopted in Congress, because it is not easy for those who are illegally raising dollars to work for themselves, to invest it or to use it for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also has a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen, which is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work, which increases unemployment," he says.
undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if we take into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, covers 60.38% of those employed in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
The low wages, the lowest in the whole of Mexico, come to unemployment and undeclared work, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September, much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in FDI
In addition to the reduction in economic activity and increasing unemployment, in 2011, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) over the last ten years is recorded. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was 630 597 dollars from January to June, a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development), for its part, has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the light of the economic crisis, the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos at the National Congress in July to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The state congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be found by November.
Reactions
The first year of the government, Mario López Valdé, made it clear for the representatives of the business community.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It is important to work hard to regain the area that has been lost this year and in 2012 we have to double our efforts. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-agreed government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events like the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slow.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will complete the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Association of Entrepreneurs) in Sinaloa, said that the state must be encouraged to become more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where we can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's prosecutor's office announced that the drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana intended for trade.
According to the Act AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010 by Mexican military in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road against guard post No 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person is still in the prison.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescue de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with a great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the city's social development authority said that, although the construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25% fell to the state. Up to now only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction of the building was expected.
"They must contribute 12 million, and even though the year is already over, they have not given us a penny, and that, even though they had to pay us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had not fulfilled its obligations and that the municipality had to take up a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which would be the amount that the central government should have made.
"We had already done so in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not provided to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the state authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he said that the Minister for Administration and Finance was requested to speed up the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is already over, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The conversion of the analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidential Decree and, by virtue of the need to forward the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued the bill on the details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order for the court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the project for the action, which was prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telesomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Telecommunications Commission in Mexico), which is why the decree would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the law's reserved rights.
In favour of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to set up the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, which was also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I do not believe that if we were to do this, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, because it is responsible for the state affairs.
The replacement of the analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in a better use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which had not only technical aspects, "because it covered economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the whole system necessary, according to the principle of economic governance by the state they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
It recalled that many countries in the world had already implemented the digital transition, through the government, even though they had highly specialised institutions.
It could not be concluded that the government would intervene in the powers of the Congress by issuing the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the legislative would be respected, "she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballot in Michoacán is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27%, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual ballot counting is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data provided by the Programa de Consultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the presidential elections is almost 27%, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just on 9 November the electoral office had adopted a number of rules to harmonise local rules with the reforms of the states in election.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his electoral law, or his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the government court within the time limits provided for, arguing that they had no objections to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional action brought by the local legislature and assessed the State Representative's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal," as he did not have the right to "decide on it or to veto it."
In an interview with María de los Ángeles Llanderal on the possibility of the individual counting of votes, María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM would now allow the local election authority to count the votes in part or in full.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results of the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not in fact available or are not in possession of the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of fully completed ballot cards may be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second-place winner, equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
The vote counting may also be made in its entirety if, after the completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that an express request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages which have been subject to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second places is almost 0.16%, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rigged down this Sunday night on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the show of the dead and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the last will of the ruler was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a plane of the Mexican Air Force. The closest people to the Colonel took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the chief deputies landed in the mourning hall, which is located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends came.
At 5.30 pm his remains were examined at the Technical Institute of Saltillo. This body show was initiated by his former fellow students from the technical abitur and his American football team, to whom Felipe Bacio was a member during his preparation for the abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountains. He had always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant-General had fulfilled all his dreams and she felt that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Zapopán Air Force, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: a plane.
One last farewell
The Lt-Col of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was passed with all due honor under the direction of the Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honour was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican air force, school leaders and students of the technological education institution of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and was excellent in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he flew down, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were also sitting.
At 6: 05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, to his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the finding, military members presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same place in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in different parts of the body and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the point 1.5 km of the country road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several of the temporary people saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up on a barrier-wide basis.
When they looked into the house, they found inside the bodies of three people, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, clothed with a white top.
The body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants was just one meter away.
All three of them were on the stomach.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, as no shell shells were found.
There are inscriptions on the wall of the country house that one organized crime group writes to another, and several shots were found in the wall and the door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defence) presented 11 persons, including a minor who were part of a crime course, which was mainly in the village of Cadereyta, associated with abduction, murder, halconeo (human hunt) and secret funerals.
According to the public information, eight people were first arrested in the settlement of Los Alvero on November 11 and one prisoner was released.
There were three real estate and a cell phone, and the arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas."
On November 12, at 6: 00 p.m., the military found a car with two occupants without license plates in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2: 00 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are being charged with secret admissions in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
A communication from the President's Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed of a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well set," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has put the cost of debt at an intolerable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard austerity package called for by the European politicians in order to regain the increased confidence in Italy.
The pressure on the rush that is being exerted on Monti has been exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, which has caused the Italian government bonds to be charged with 7% interest for 10 years, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue aid.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confederation of Industry Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti, "We said we would support this government in all our efforts."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success of Monti were significantly increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti are intended to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats government that is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the delay in the reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks is also under pressure with its indication that a failure of Monti is a disaster.
Monti started on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The session is scheduled to be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, launched an extremely rapid change of government.
After a short breath towards the end of the last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of the Italian government bonds has again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a state debt of EUR 1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU umbrella.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, an indication of their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the games make the involvement of people from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games on the bump.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly game that is taking place today at 3: 05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one on the FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-colour team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England, each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-level European acups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Fury with complicated selection games at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
The Tico football players, on the other hand, have few international encounters in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see the Spanish team draw its last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a match with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign matches.
Casillas will play against the three-colour team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition last week from the UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the central storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of a hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53rd.
From the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the Sturmer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the least games.
Less than 30 games are played in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even close to the 20-line.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts in the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures them that a dream will be realized for them when they play in Costa Rica.
The bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is located in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will be performing at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an excerpt from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costarican fans a dream is realized when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we have played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will probably stay there a few more days.
It's exciting for us to take our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert more intense.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long until we get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we have put down in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world for that.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about it, about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the Costa Rica event?
Since we have never played there, we have no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that is partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Each one likes another song, so the decision we will play is not easy.
When we record two or three songs that we haven't played for a long time, we can keep our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you will celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, will it be hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years.
We continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to take part actively in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement comes out of a group of friends.
Sometimes a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw soundguards on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands do.
First of all, I think we all appreciate being alive and, in addition, we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One of them trusts the other and his music. We could not be better.
Your relationship to glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we've grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall into this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come for the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created without being a famous rock star. We never cared about that.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written very good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this band the best. Therefore we are curious to see what Las Roberta can offer live. It will be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
Who were you influenced by as a bass player?
From so many +
The first to think of me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassist I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it's no longer a fashion show?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it's great, because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever.
At first, her music was darker, now it's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little light-headed, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to both of them when I heard Ed play them. It's very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - that your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly affect that for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his home doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years in prison for violating human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated four times and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congressman and his personal doctor, told the TV that Fujimori would be studied in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas for three days to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body parts.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish it because he thought he was innocent.
It has been operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Since September 2007, Fujimori has been located at the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was in secret during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official secondment, led by the Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón the next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, business people and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayan living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the President of the South American country announced on its website.
According to the local media, Mujica is looking for the support of Calderón for the incident with France, when the French head of government, Nicolas Sarkozy, put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and led to a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double assessment with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, a free trade agreement has been in place between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to the growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cordless installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
For 25 years, Super Mario has been tirelessly fighting for the rescue of Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he is fighting for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month to the shop counter of the world, has been cut from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played three-dimensional without a special pair of glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was Nintendo's first video game, which was developed for this console from the very beginning, "because so far, success articles such as" Star Fox 64 3D "or" Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D "were already existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman stressed that, although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "affordable" video game that allowed a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less cunning users.
After that, the experts can make a "second round" about the different game life, which is becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects," it is always necessary to play three-dimensional.
This trip to the three-dimensional world of Super Marios also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo wink to the fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last issues: The cordless installer has to overcome the platforms with danger-ridden to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player comes up with news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would accept the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy to money laundering of US $70 million.
The process of the US's request for the extradition of Portillo will end so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judicial authority and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not intervened in court decisions and had accepted all the extradition requests he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The action of Colom is a government act that is taken when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered when his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the 120 million quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign, which was preceded by extradition, but the minister put in opposition and revived the case.
Trinidad has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organisation was created to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social assistance organisation Trinijove have produced important results: in this quarter of a century, 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion were supported in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over 100 jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people took part.
In 1986, in the Trinitat Vella district, the aim was to help young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
At yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, many of the leaders of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association in these 25 years took part.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during the election period was the impartiality of the work done by Trinidad.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and now left-green councillor Ricard Goma.
The large room of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Fund of the La Caixa savings bank, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis."
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house, where huge parties were held, was cleared
The house owners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the Balmes street no. 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 occupants left the building last afternoon without any resistance.
Everything points to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on the street of Balmes have come to an end.
Twelve people left the building, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals, which had led the neighborhood to despair. The eviction took place on a judicial order without police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the house administrator.
The occupants, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the others were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply with them. They had painted the walls and left all kinds of waste, especially cans of alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and led the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the occupants made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place had been indicated by the neighbors because of the disturbance of the rest, while according to her statement the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the house occupants, and in particular by the guests of the parties that were organized there, and which, according to the displeased neighbors, have become more and longer in recent weeks.
The person responsible for the discotheque said that the harassment was so large that it agreed with the owner of the building that it would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that in the last few weeks she had received more complaints from the neighbours.
The president of the PP (Pardo Popular People's Party) at the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called for the building to be cleared immediately and the problems of civil coexistence and the downfall of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months the occupants had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, there had even been theft.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3: 30, the police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The urban call for proposals on the 16 goals opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now missing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its disdain on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, in the eyes of many, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but rather up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
The role of the Yogner was not a model of the Central Park, but of Yellowstone with wild boars.
So far, when the city issued a huge invitation to tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access to Collserola.
There is no doubt that a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's planning on setting goals on the country.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also in view of a reflection on the city the subject of discussion in the mouth of all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurrent subject that two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can rely on.
And this is the very fact that one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The call is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to talk about the "front on the mountain" after the attack on the coast, as long as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who is about the green apples, has not been held.
"One should assume the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "says the architect, for whom the title" Tore of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": it must not be imagined" as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas where it is necessary to act. "
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, regards the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" which "contains some dangers."
The "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it today" following the experience of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is its own limitation to what can be built.
"To limit something always means to set the next step," i.e. to exceed it.
"It is necessary to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, says that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona," for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronate de Collserola, which should not "be on deaf ears," although he is grateful to the city administration for giving its body the opportunity to "participate" in this project from the first moment.
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the direct letter, which allows the architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" as to whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("just the right thing," he says), "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as the terms of the invitation to tender lack a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-section competitions," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that the area as a whole looks at."
At least in his case, this has led him to take part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped over the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length, which creates a soft transition between the city and the green zones.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the agent of Casino Red released the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the agent of Casino Red has given him a trial against the mayor's brother of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the assassination of the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen, who is supposed to force him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to do the secret operation of the competition.
After the lawsuit, the prosecution opened a criminal case against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre for allegedly bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained only a few hours in the middle-security law, as there were murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as the inmate of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, was given an arrest order, who found that after the almost two months of investigations, there would be sufficient evidence to make Jonás guilty for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the race house in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to give the sentence, and he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had done the damage and who the owner of the competition had made his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held the name back.
According to case 197 / 2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted. In the following, no objections can be filed against the trial, and no compensation is required.
After the hearing of the representative of the competition at around 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case was put to the file.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the aircraft accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed indicate that the helicopter, with its whole unharmed structure, was directly on the ground without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing was in contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, where the helicopter lost the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, so he met all the requirements for the transport of the staff.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the field in which the machine had come down.
"No aircraft parts were found in other places during the search, the impact was on the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, so it met all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At the moment, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the one hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Airplanes and Assistance Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidential at a speed of travel and that the aircraft had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, counted six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In line with the flight standards it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the team should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the flight to the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep-hanging clouds were raised.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. There may have been no loss of control over the plane before the impact, nor any deviation from the flight route.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to the present time suggests that the helicopter was in a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was on the ground with its unbeatable structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the site of the accident do not indicate either fire or explosion.
The last results of the study indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The area is sloping and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minuteous search in an area that went beyond the closed area at the site of the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft could be found, thus increasing the assumption that the unincorporated aircraft structure had fallen to the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for finding the gene for obesity
She is the head of a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and young people, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers, was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the post-graduate programme at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinveststav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports areas of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8: 00.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and was continued on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the target of 500 to 600 research staff is reached, the study will be continued at the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed at the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He said that the aim of the study was to know the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the world's diabetes day, he said that it was intended that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 should fill in food-related questionnaires with the consent and under the supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease in order to control risk factors that might result in diabetes or renal failure.
He also stated that on the above-mentioned Saturdays the test staff were measured (weight, size, waist size), their blood pressure controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys in 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years, the proportion of obese boys had increased by 77% and that of girls with obesity by 47%. The overweight had also increased dramatically," said the IMSS specialist.
He said that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican (s) was on average 65% Indian-American, 30% European and 5% African, which was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he said that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) that we have taken, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher said that the direct benefit to the study participants was a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and in the internal arm (acanthosis), which indicate the probability of metabolic disorders and pre-existing diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and given to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the results of the measurements and propose to them changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said that there are three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, lack of movement in everyday life, most of the day to spend in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.

Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, developed with polymers modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs of the road surface were to be taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 potholes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (the city area of the valley of Mexico) would break out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt cover would be appropriate, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Potholes from a Technical Perspective," which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus to avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most heavy part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which a part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthenes. Together they give the road surface its characteristic tentelastic behaviour.
Tensile behaviour of asphalt means that at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C it behaves like a liquid, at 120 ° C it is very tactile and at 50 ° C it is almost firm, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible road surface, composed of six material layers, of which the last three were asphalt.
Between the top layers there is a wear layer of asphalt consisting of small stones, bonded in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of power in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he said, "a last layer is designed, the so-called bearing layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
As this layer is in contact with the vehicle handles, it requires a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it has to produce friction.
The most forces received and distributed by this road surface also require an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be taken into account, especially the water, "he said," because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water penetrates into the layer and it is difficult to escape again. This causes a softening of all the layers of the road surface and therefore the appearance of impact holes.
When a hole is created, "he said," the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only then affected, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) said that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road cover must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is respected in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries and with which the potholes could be easily repaired without applying high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle is given his 14th mistitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty in the award of the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to be on the winning podium, to show a silver crown and the band she has shown as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already has 14 mistitles and Melina is a member of the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the proclaimed mises are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Maria Maria Maria (1989), Maria Maria Maria (1989), Maria Maria (1989), Maria (1989), Maria (1989), Maria Maria (1989), Maria (1989), Maria (1989), Maria (1989), Maria (1989), Maria (1989), Maria (1989), Maria (1989), Maria (1989) (1989).
The big question that many are asking today is: what was missing?
Because the result is the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected the Queen of the Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that the beauty queen Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received and taken home the crown of the Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury's decision to appoint her First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you most and why?" which was asked to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing, in the end I think that the book, which was the most important for my childhood, is' The Little Prince ', a rather deep book.
At the moment I read 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'passions'.
A response that met with little love, first because of the term 'civilizing' and second because it had not specifically explained how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it is what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that "the fact that she was the preferred one, who had all the adversaries and who had received all the prizes in advance (the Oster gastronomy competition, the audience vote on the best custom-made costume and Reina Madre)," had made the other candidates jealous, which the Queen stressed, which was why she could not shine on stage. "
And this was noticed at her first performance in the bathing suit on the Hilton-Hotel beach and at her two elevators at the coronation party.
Although she was safe with both, she lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned as a Miss "shows that the candidate who won the most prizes during the competition, after all, does not become queen."
In addition, at the end of the press, Valle went out of the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about their interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. It is necessary to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, that she had already worked on projects before she took part in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derrier and fibrosis, which she was told in the stomach area, but that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good food habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on her belly, which was, to be honest, hard to notice, her score on the last day was pressed."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedure she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and that place had to pay her. "
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel forecast was created after the performance in the bathing suit that was to come true at night. It was tuddled that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize to not let her enjoy the crown.
No matter whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is taking over her year of reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had lost the crown.
So the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano was
A loposcopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a loposcopist of the Public Prosecutor's Office's (CTI) investigation unit from Cali was the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven loposopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had on-call service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were found.
In 2000, he settled in Valle over and after the completion of the required courses, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
During the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was to identify two bodies and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be, so he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name) with him.
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the most investigation, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, did not wear glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
In search of tracks
The appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important for a dactyloscopic of the Sijín in Cali.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists do not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they're arrested, many offenders present false identity papers or they don't have any.
We'll take the fingerprints off them and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to take a piece of a wall out of a house in the event of a theft, because the thief had supported himself with his hand right here when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprinting. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had taken part in several theft," he remembered.
With the help of the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the investigation, it was assumed that a family member could be a suspect, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle was in agreement.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopic said that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to take them.
After that, the prints will be sent to the Asif, that's the crime database, or to the personal office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID papers," said the expert from CTI.
He said not everything is as it would be shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all the gold that shines is not all that you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "outrageous" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators came together in tents on Zuccotti Square.
A large part of it followed the evacuation order and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York this Tuesday, when they again tried to enter the Manhad Square with a judicial order, after they had been removed from the square at dawn and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators came together in front of the Zuccotti Square, to which they wanted to get access with a judicial order that allowed the "indignation" to the "new tent" at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement followed the eviction order and occupied a park further north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street."
Bray stated that the response of the "indignation" to the extermination of her camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order that forbade the violent extermination of the place and allowed the protesters to camping.
The "Emperors" also occupied a new park, located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give accurate numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have arrived at this place, where a secondment of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in the expectation of a judicial hearing, which is still scheduled for this Tuesday, to analyse the legality of the evacuation found at dawn.
Some of the protesters who were driven from the place carried and distributed photocopies of this judicial order. They even gave them to some policemen who were watching the place, which led to "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and to prohibit the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that this judicial order had lifted the new opening of the place to the public and the demonstrators. He pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to reestablish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti square at dawn, in which almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "violated the law."
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to evacuate the place, because it had "turned into a place where people did not come to dismount, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "some business had received threats" and residents were "asking for their quality of life."
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in the protection of the financial interests and not the protection of the interests of the North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they were thinking about organising "big actions" for Thursday, together with community organisations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have taken since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV-Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will be on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," rescue swimmer in "Baywatch," rabbit at "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (balladenser) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will be in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today spread pictures of the TV program in which Anderson - also for the spread on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she and her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, appears as a Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator on the show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, as a child of Jesus.
The CTV Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
In one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called the North American Kim Kardashian a "whore."
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still in the recovery after the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced in the Second World War.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo evaluated the damage to property to $300 000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were finally used to complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decrease in investment recorded between January and March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual economic change of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is growing particularly thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, after the Yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "return currencies" of investors fleeing the euro-zone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is, like a tombstone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, have led their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiegen the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very exhilarating.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clear signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, showed that the brake would have been on the greatest economic potential.
For it fell by four tenths to a lot of 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro-zone is even below this average, which is 100, after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives rise to doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high-level risk premiums of the peripheral countries and a wide-ranging uncertainty, Greece is still lost in the maze that leads out of the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being proved by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one hundred days that he was appointed may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, said that he would support the new austerity measures and in no case would withdraw his request for new elections on the scheduled date, 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for officials and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
However, Samara's communication does not question his position: "We have committed ourselves to the support of the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs. He made it clear that he would not approve a commitment to the implementation of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, confirmed yesterday that it was not to be said that economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "signed a clear written agreement as soon as possible."
The Minister of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million "even though there is no final date.
The Greek ball still has strings for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position in the world in the role of micro-finance."
The Queen Sofía of Spain yesterday recalled that in the last two decades Spain has become the second donor of this means of international cooperation in the world. Its "being" is based on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in people."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the fifth world summit on micro-credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of people who have to live with income of less than one dollar a day, that is below the" poverty line. "
Spain "continues to work" on the extension of the network of beneficiaries to the last corner of the world, and it is responsible for this task, "said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that the summit will take until Thursday will be guaranteed" the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, for women, "as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have had many successes" and "face many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for "launching two fundamental objectives."
The Queen stated that it was intended that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the design of micro-credit is based on the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago," which the Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition."
She described the father of this financing instrument as a "admirable idealist who has committed herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen went to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington followed this experience and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we have been able to observe a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday brought her the assessment as the "head of the family" in Valladolid and as the "advocate of the poor."
Finally, the Queen Sofia ended her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to link development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment."
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty," and that the governments of the developed countries should now "more than ever" work according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of development aid."
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, "clapped" the success, "marginalized" people "who are always in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "open their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig, was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally provided for in the programme, but was established in the autumn, in particular to ensure that those activists who consider the government policy on the Greeks today and possibly Italy to be too lax tomorrow.
The European Commission's presidential request proposed by the Bureau was almost unanimously adopted.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation which lasted several minutes, which was first used by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, left no doubt on the part of the three European-inclined finance ministers.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as well as the application - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be reflected by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union with regard to the budget policies of the euro area countries, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general vote "to give Europe a face."
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, to which Wolfgang Schäuble Pate clearly stood.
It is certainly not very likely that the 47 will soon agree on this revolution: Groβ-Britannia is opposed to the cause, and the CDU's leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is in the same opinion.
The milestone is, however, set.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country on the Governing Board, according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously lead to an increase in Germany's position.
The chancellor, who was thinking about reassuring the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the points of reference for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, who would immediately criticise the arrogant Germany.
In so far as the European application devotes a paragraph to the importance of the "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
For this reminds us that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud in the case of disease reports represent?
According to the family benefits, UMP and government are now taking on the health reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to find a family aid fund and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has always been a recurring issue since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to test the economy in a hard test, but on the other hand is no less a proponent of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is planning the introduction of a fourth day of care before taking into account a health report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose four days' pay without the permission of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echo," is threatening to provoke anger, but would help to bring in EUR 280 million.
And that would be more symbolic with another measure: to give the state officials an unbenevolent day of care in the case of a disease (so far, there is no period of care for them, in contrast to the three days of care in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also rekindles the issue of fraud, with the aim of this time on the abuse associated with work seniority.
"Controls will be much more important and, in addition, they will be reimbursed if required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday 13 November of the RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of health reports seems to be somewhat unproportional.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensives that have borne most of the fruit.
The French are no longer more sick than people in other places in Europe.
However, first of all, we are in the country-wide figures.
According to the National Sickness Fund, in 2006, more than 237 million euros of daily payments were paid.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of the Health Service, daily payments in 2008 represented EUR 11.3 billion 5% of health expenditure.
This amount included 46% on maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% on sickness leave, which is called EUR 6.2 billion.
And so, 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were granted on average only 14.5 days of illness compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
One average, which covers some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, the career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers interviewed reported that they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were less than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared with their European neighbours, French workers do not tend to be in employment more than elsewhere.
A long-term study carried out in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global dissenting rate (disease or other reasons) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of health reports is a very small proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, there is only a weak level of fraud.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systemic controls on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university of training and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 of the implemented short-term disease reports, which is called "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
In the systematically controlled cases of disease for more than 45 days, under 1.2 million were counted 11% of "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, which is called 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed a health report.
A figure which represents only a small proportion of, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to the UMP, Dominique Tian, author of a substantive report on this issue, published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euro per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the deflation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needed a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced this to Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union was not enough to do this.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government in his first public speech in the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurosummit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "would be at stake," he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit by "9%" of GDP from today's to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his approval on Monday to the measures already approved with regard to an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had sent forward that his party would not be prepared for an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his party's new democracy.
He had agreed to the requirements of reducing the budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties of their support for the planned measures, had answered Antonio Samaras that his word was enough and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and associated free time must be legalized, such as an expert body
The Canadians live in denial of death, as a report of the Royal Society of Canada shows.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain-reducing means, including beyond the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they would like to die and take positions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia to be made where this choice is made, in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts quoted a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world's ball.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th place, the study notes that "medical care in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painful means, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority desire of the Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of the deaths in the hospital.
On the sensitive question of euthanasia and associated suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions, which are not opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it would not want to make any changes to the law on euthanasia and associated suicide.
But now, according to the experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would result in the application of such a practice of euthanasia or associated suicide of uncompetent or unconsensual persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such transgressions in countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconferencing.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also associated suicide is practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already been in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that these allowed people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not mean that the message is that the life of older or disabled people is of less value.
As regards those who have already been involved in an accompanying suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or cessation of patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of the funds for which a legal refusal had been made should not be considered as criminal.
The Panel also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect the end-of-life reduction and to be afraid of this without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together in terms of pain-reducing treatment to provide the best pain-reducing means, including beyond the cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the means already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions, the Panel calls for pain relief or life-end measures to be considered, at least as they were not used as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and to apply the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some health experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the undersigned experts, among other things, "extreme," as they do not set any limits to euthanasia practice in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is tired and older than 18 years of age should ask another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had looked through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility on all other values that are involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
In particular, Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, has doubts about the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans Bashar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, which, however, is holding back on it thanks to the support of Russia, and which has a "plot" against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's exclusion, the European Union has intensified its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the reigning Arab Prime Minister, who had asked President Bashar al-Assad "to lay down his power of office in Syria," in which about forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, the Turkish head of diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts to the Syrian regime had not been successful since the beginning of the year.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must go," he said in allusion to Syria, the neighbouring country on which Turkey is taking a ever-growing position.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have made an ever-increasing sound in the face of the repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, so the Syrian Human Rights Observatory announced OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had been killed in "Shot-changing and severe bomb attacks around Jobar" in the besieged city of Hom.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister, Walid al-Muallim, was nevertheless of the opinion that the country "was heading towards the end of the crisis."
He has, by the way, responded strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which in his view was a "dangerous step."
"Syria will not give in," he added, under the control that "the plans forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers in order to protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he was bound by his "paranoia."
An outside-planned new assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the crisis-out, as decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lawrow, yesterday, classified the Arab League's decision as "uncorrect" in order to avoid the support of possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be ready for sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has asked the markets for a little more time to form his staff and to implement a program that "victims" demand to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly made up of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
In turn, Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had to wait outside for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence to Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation of a string list presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented, yesterday's nervousness of the stock market and the obligation markets called for their time.
In "a democracy there are certain time limits" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, saying that it is "certain that the markets will show themselves in a reasonable and understanding way."
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets at the beginning, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro-zone in September.
The Prime Minister-in-Office should set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians."
The new government should only exist by 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Since the start of his function, M. Monti has committed himself to working in an urgent manner in order to make Italy a "new leader" in Europe.
A spokesperson for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself is not changing, taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance objective in 2013, despite the austerity plans that have been taken up in recent months, has in particular requested new measures of urgency.
Emma Marcegaglia, "head of the" Italian leaders, who will meet on Tuesday, also insists on the need to boost the economy, "as a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit indicators."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of age" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" and another "Italy," said the editorial authors.
The great unknown are the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will now have to pay for EUR 200 billion of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Vyatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon explosive capsule, an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The ISIS Institute of Science and International Security is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents from this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
The OEA had announced its "serious concern" last week on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, the Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was said to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds."
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was involved in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the OEA mentioned "strong evidence that the Iranian development" of a nuclear fuel system "had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only interested in this technology but also, as a member of the Agency said, had worked all his professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religious-motivated crimes of violence have either decreased or increased slightly in the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these data, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims had increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas there was a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" had increased to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes, the FBI said.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," said the human rights organisation Human Rights First. "The increase in anti-Islamic acts of violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights law," added Paul Legendre, a member of the organisation.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, with an assessment that this could be done with an improvement in the police attitude towards "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" is a legacy of the period of the struggle for civil rights in American federal law.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or descent and now also involving crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is more and more like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter Microblogging website introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which once again makes the service similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow a better reading of the activities of other "Twitterers," the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are being followed and who are following your messages.
This allows them to find out whether they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new contributions, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet spread on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users," said the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive function, equipped with some esotherically appropriate wording (RT for referenced recollection of the contribution of another person). follow-up holiday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un management plus compatible a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
In the network, users, with the help of certain "tweets," discussed this innovation via the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and is too much like Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The function" activity "will help me to better track certain elements of my flux-twitter," said @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a "golden budget rule" in the Constitution
The government in power in Austria of the large social-democratic / Christian-democratic coalition decided on Tuesday to include a "golden budget rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in the top credit rating of Austria (AAA).
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, even though the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not fallen to a single blow from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year," said Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian-Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also calls for the Brussels summit of the euro-zone Member States of 26 October: the Heads of State or Government had at that time called for the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and for a return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government in this respect is similar to the "German model," as Germany was the first European country to have included such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall by 0.75% of GDP each year, and from 2017, the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The objective of the 2020 / 21 horizon is to eliminate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in the currency markets
On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that the Japanese authority would again intervene in the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, "we will intervene as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday the Yen was in turn close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar to reduce the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is about to use a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
The yen, however, has risen regularly over it, doped by purchases of investors who see the yen as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of the global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic lat of 105 yen near the levels that had tripped the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar reported around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income worth of Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11, which devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east)," says M. Noda, who fears that this power of the yen can kill the weak upswing already in the bud.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the sprawling export volumes and the consumption of the "blocked" households.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that the rise of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan."
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for its part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to disarm the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has informed that the BoJ has already launched "appropriate measures," which made it clear that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its state bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to take out the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of the cover it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Euro-zone:
interest-rate feet fast up, stock exchanges make returnees
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European figures.
Despite the opening of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to increase.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are also drifting a little more into negative areas this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10: 00 and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions in the return on government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn is suffering from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis is continuing, had closed with a base of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving towards a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the euro area is damaging the single currency, which continues its bout on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At about 10 o'clock, the European Valuta was worth 1.3570, so it went down by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had met in Congress on Monday, had accepted a request which, in particular, provided for the possibility of countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, and that of the Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the concerns of investors.
The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the face of the markets as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The "spread" between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historical high.
In anticipation of growth in the euro-zone
Statitically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most concerned by economic experts.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The EU Commission is expected to have a first up-turn of the entire euro area at 11 a.m., warning of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as a starting point, to think about this issue and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it is to explore the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not have to renounce a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision subject to the need to find a substitute source, or in Switzerland, which is just about to build only the last generation of nuclear power plants.
The UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only a few countries, continue to follow their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add another unit to its park by redeploying the Three Mile Island plant, which was closed after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is based on renewable energy sources, is sometimes seen as a model, reality is contrary to the discourse.
The Berlin election will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, in particular on Russia, by increasing the use of import gas, an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal power plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason to think.
Denmark is, on the one hand, a European table leader in terms of wind energy, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, and on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are both 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French budgets.
As the energy price in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and a stability finding of the industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the price of energy, which made the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the large majority of French people are not willing to pay as much as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France took the decision to step out of nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would be more and more shrinking.
Which electrician would have an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of his producer is preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no such thing as a devil's work as a means of generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear and renewable energy developed by Areva demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so it has been without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was brought up by reactor construction and unending human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters, which caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and of the cooperation of the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that will enable it to be resistant to such phenomena.
As it is considered desirable for the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to have emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that, as well as economic, social and financial situation in our country, is also determined.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - the overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had called itself.
Recently, the public-sector harassment against foreign students had shaped the weekly shows, and the Minister of the Interior had announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need any talent, masons or waiters from abroad."
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right hand side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 said that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrated workers, should not be a problem for a country," on the left hand side by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 explained that France "cannot absorb all the poverty of the world."
The only difference is in the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
The two camps saw immigrants as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande is limited to banalities that point out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems."
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present to us in a recent work, which summarises the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fear of the influence of migrants is based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local labour force, in particular the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they are mainly engaged in jobs in sectors that are in the labour market.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local wage workers, and the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not comparable to the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetists, this complementarity also results in a positive effect of immigrants' access to wages and the domestic labour market.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flow of immigrants results in a long-term, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is beneficial (high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in the European countries, on average, at about 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who migrates to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, make a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget over its lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to take up his mandate to create the missing intersection points "with the teeth."
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy prevail over its enemies once and for all.
It is known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of the mind attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can be as well a "suppression instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of the powers, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe in which we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek True-False referendum would have had a double-insightful character in this respect: the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inconvenience.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to press for the success of the national referendum, which was organised in a different way, depending on the needs and the wrong order.
A free ticket for the European sole ruler or a jump in the void of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but we want a collective task, fully justified and constantly, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - it is no longer known where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is protesting the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which suffer from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single nation that is attached to it.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to popular sovereignty.
It is a matter of the whole of whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and create a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is a condition for decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic justice, without certainly leading us to ruin.
The Commission is not in a position to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community is able to take
Agreed.
But it would be a new foolishness and a further deadlock without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it is the citizens' idea - to imagine this.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We must form a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contact-less" chip cards become the general good
The world trade fair for chipcards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic position.
According to Euromart, the year 2011 should end with a 11% increase in world-wide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most successful segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year ago, 460 million contactless chipcards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment, after a long period of time behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been spread.
However, the consumer markets are steam-blowing.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"In the future, two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically hand over bank cards with a contactless chip to their customers," says Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A very small percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They have been delayed."
"But they should at least be able to see a real upward trend next year."
"We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," says Marc Bertin, President of Euromart.
But the banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare for the launch of an offer that would allow its customers to pay without any contact by mobile phone.
Terrorist front is understood from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
The long-awaited relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel had confirmed that Algiers had now "obtained certainty about it."
"The way in which both organisations work and the relations of the secret services point to a clear cooperation," he said, without going further into detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger last January had given rise to an increase in the number of interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who had been kidnapped by Aqmi's followers in a restaurant in Niamey, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found in the debris at the location of the operation several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls led leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: a number leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must certainly wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's possible, though."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from the outside and that it is becoming increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kule Amuwo attends.
In these last few months, these "support services" have become more and more apparent in their course, as have the speeches and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of suicide bombers and the use of ever-more complex explosives that bear the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin with Washington, has since then put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact for a long time considered the group to be a community of illuminates, who do not need to be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist faith of Mohammed Yusuf - which means in Haoussa as much as "Western education is a shame" - is following the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It is a political and demanding strict respect for Sharia, while the activists attached to it are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have in mind churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their increased attacks on the Commissioners.
The reaction from Abuja is, however, as usual indicated.
The army is surrounded by the city, and 800 people are killed.
The prisoner, Mohammed Yusuf, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming more radical and is leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she committed herself to an assassination in Jos, which required 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the guilt of a suicide attack that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations will become the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been a concern to all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger have occupied the Somali of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria about Boko Harem and was ready to "share all the information."
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
In the middle of Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they are competing in the simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like this, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-leaders have repeatedly let their thundering statements and their statements on external policy, the traditional Republican focus, be made clear.
China, Iran and Israel, often in no way underpinned, fall slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party," the highest-ranking Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse them of the "currency manipulation" - the leading issue in a America that is at the very heart of the migration of entire industries to Asia.
He said that if this was to imply the initiation of a trade war, he would be stupid.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of outside politics, has almost cut off the air in terms of his flattering offer of emotions.
He had called for a strong but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman is not heard because he is stagnating in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he had tinted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel increased military aid and charged Obama with having been guilty of commitments to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest-ranking candidate, is in turn showing a shameful file identity.
He recently called for a control of the Chinese military threat, as Beijing "tried to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed to be taking note of the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas's governor, Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, is in turn prepared to take the American army into service against drug cartels in Mexico.
Obama's 2009 ban on the use of torture measures against suspected terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an external political heavyweight.
The current presidential contrast is that Reagan had also had simple ideas and won the Cold War in spite of all this.
They recall that Obama was also an amateur and had to put water in his wine, which was the subject of anti-terrorism.
They are right to insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
However, this hostility is not so unforced.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive results of the Obama National Security that Bin Laden has taken out.
Since Iraq, it has been protecting itself from military intervention leading to a slamming.
And Obama is more surprised by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to bring its leadership to a new life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea bottom and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with shine and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level, last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast, under orchestral sound and at a gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned the wheel of the valve that transports the Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is intended to supply 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe by a first pipeline of 1,224 km, which connects the Sankt Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which will allow a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - equivalent to the French total consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you can already make the eventuality of building a third line on your own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building is a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any road traffic through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little bit of their power: it is now more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most engaged in the debate, had not retreated from comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-and-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically very sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of a reduction in European energy, as the project has made a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has barely managed in five years to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are coming to a halt.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us in an organic way," confirmed François Fillon at the opening of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the large gas agreements are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the many Gazprom managers in Lubmin about the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete coating, which is intended to protect it from ship's anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, in about 200 m depth.
During their construction, mining fields dating from the Second World War had to be removed.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed in a cautious way," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream company.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project managers have not been able to do so, as the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state company permanently settle at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of a disaster, we close the gas pass in less than a minute," specified Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline is then released into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be only little likely, as the weld seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes by a seagoing ship, and by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on the possible deformations of the metal on its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the least repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (each of 15.5%), as are the Dutch gas company and the French group GDF Suez (each of 9%).
These five companies have formed a company group called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, to an extended twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real volume of gas is," specified Jens Müller.
The financing of gas transmission was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are committed to recovering their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline comes out of the Baltic Sea on a sandy, pine-wooded coastal indent at Lubmin.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas-side stripping gates.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a Markennotizbuch.
Founded by an Italian company about 15 years ago, Moleskine now wants to give new style to writing.
It has a flair of adventure, at candlelight with writing hours added.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the egg-coloured sides, aged over time.
The Moleskine Notebook, as you know today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distanced design notice book.
Maria Sebregondi, then a specialist consultant of the company, is commissioned to market the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (Mulwurfshaut), which is a cotton varnish used for example for upholstered benches.
This kind of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered to be an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand leader at Modo Modo.
The success comes.
Sales are up 26% between 2006 and 2010 and are established with a sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, as the notebook also inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and is committed to enforcing its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and his new need for writing, which exists despite the rise of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently the brand launched an exposure called "Detour (Umweg)," in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit of time and understood how to diversify his products: bags, calendar of dates, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings envy on the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled begins."
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% of total unemployment.
Disgraced?
"No, it is said that Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adad, is the" week of work for the disabled. ""
"The progress made within 15 years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high as three times that."
"Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for the disabled before they get a job.
More often it is the older: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% for the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work and which "form the core of the problem," said Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the physical brakes.
It remains the unspoken, the spiritual attitudes that are certainly, but slow to develop.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrerendre Association for the magazine La Cité indicated that the surveyed managers have "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled," which is "overrepresented" by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually underrepresented. "
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, as laid down in a 1987 law.
The latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agepiph, to the organisation, which is responsible for collecting contributions from companies that are in breach of this law.
The evidence is that the number of "fees paid" sites, as well as the sum of the amounts paid in between 2007 and 2011, has decreased from 59,000 to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for an increase in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 and 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday" (20: 45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide their pleasure, which brought them the friendly game.
It would be too far-reaching to say that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Seated side by side on the audience podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have liked to make peace.
Five months after the temper gesture of his opponent against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had won nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the born-in-law, for his part, assures.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and national 11, "It is a unity that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought on Friday evening against Romania with regard to the match against France, to finally "shine."
But without leaving the note of "pleasure."
The French national team has been on fire since the age of 7, and he led his victorious campaign between 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to increasing the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he says.
"We just ran into each other."
"To be allowed to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, made the sound of "pride" with kindness.
"The pride of wearing a galamatch."
"Pride" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbours" - that France "has become a team at a very high level again," and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a hell of a job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician will see the plane share with the blue (the French national 11)... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big," he said.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the replay against Bosnia (22: 00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The two teams had not been able to play the game.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that "La Selecçao," his national eleven, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
For Portugal, this is in fact only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is a match to play and to serve an opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to press the important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we have not achieved a new exit gate."
At home, however, in their bright stage de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be in front of an audience that is also likely to be at stake, even if the game was of course announced as "very close," the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very close match, but we are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be in the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
The draw in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to achieve and win a goal.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we have not achieved a foreign portal," Bento regrets.
"We will fight against a team with high technical qualities and with players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have planned to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided it is put into practice this time.
