This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely used, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fallow of this animal on the top was chestnut brown and on the bottom was light or carotinoid.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called Rachis, but have other features of feathers - threaded and barbules - the researchers concluded that the Rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used to fly but rather to regulate temperature or to show. The researchers suspected that the sample, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the body of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the presence of an adult and no down-of-the-kitchen.

Edgar Veguilla suffered wounds on his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed reconstructive surgery for his face.
The gun of Uka had a load inhibition when he was aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has been in chronic pain since then, is blind on one eye, and he is missing a part of his skull. His face had to be reconstructed with the help of Titan.
Schneider said on a video call from a base of the USAF in his home country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo took part in the championship in two individual races.
Her first was the slalom, in which she received a "Did not Finish" in her first run. 36 of the 116 participants achieved the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, ended with the 10th place in the women's group with a combined run of 4: 41.30. Thus, she was 2: 11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1: 09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who took the ninth place.
Four skiers of the Kücrenskikeit did not finish, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Riesenslalom could not place in the race.
The police at Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and the mobile phone.
The Deputy General Inspector D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who have raped the Swiss and have secured their phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police president, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the defendants had appeared in court with covered faces.
Although there were three people in the house as the car snapped in, none of them were hurt.
The driver, however, suffered significant injuries to the head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya was charged with murder of her son before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody until the indictment and trial, but statements of eyewitnesses may have been falsified, as her image was widely published.
This is a different practice in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary is working differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous border if you publish photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians call for the borders to be put back into the state before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other issues that are supposed to be covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of Jordan.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley of ten years from the signing of the agreement, but the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence only for five years.
The shooters of the accompanying plague control test should be closely supervised by rangers as the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage in the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training lessons.
Martelly has sworn a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martin's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the country's governance package for new elections.
The Commission was Martin's response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The cause of the partial violent protests was the non-conduct of elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
More than 60 cases of overheating have been reported in the case of defective iPods. A total of six fires have been triggered and four people have suffered light burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economic Affairs, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that he was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple about 34 other overheating events that the company called" non-serious. ""
The Ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "really regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07: 19 local time (21: 19 GMT on Friday).
The Civil Protection Office of the Northern Mariana said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had also explained that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 gun.
Several hostages have been saved and there have been at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released at an early stage, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers took the place of an older lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Ligins entered his father's footsteps and made a medical career.
In 1959, he began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began to study early labor in his free time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered two "black box" airletters.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said," Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman. ""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who opposed Australia to becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 election campaign, the temporary Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared that in her view Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarchin.
29 percent of the respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at Olympic Games was to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the disciplines of 100 m and 200 m freestyle as well as in three stand-alone games, but his fitness was doubted because of his many complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary drugs to overcome his pain, as they are prohibited at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery by means of different hardware and software at the beginning of February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of the earth's water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and make life possible.
Since comets had a long time ago collided with the Earth, the scientists promise themselves insights into how planets, especially the Earth, are created.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill to legalize the same-sex marriage last month.
He described the rumours as "political chatter and allegiance."
It is speculated that he could apply for the President's office in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and to provide the pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transport and the underground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
With the concern for lack of transport opportunities, the chance of the game being held behind closed doors without the fans of the team was growing.
A study published in the Science magazine on Thursday reported on the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within only two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwinfink, Geospiza fortes, and the migrated cactus fink, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into different forms. It can be rolled in tiny forms.
It can be drawn to a thin wire that can be turned and braided. It can be hammered or rolled to leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. It is possible to produce an indicator with red coal juice.
The coal juice changes its color, depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which their electrons have been removed (for hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powder together and then form it with clean, wet hands into a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated waste water system.
The rest of the waste water systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that visited men and women in mixed society.
If you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was transported from a rocket to space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere is a little distorted by our light and our look.
It takes a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the wheel has done to us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized animals, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are many small cats (including free-straying domestic cats) that eat far smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of her success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and that ensures that she does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called pack.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and boys.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when living in a large family with sisters and daughters.
The lion's pack is similar to the wolf or dog's, animals that are surprisingly similar to the lions (but not other big cats) in their behaviour and are as deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not very well), swim, jump large distances and draw with the five-fold power of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence made of creepy words.
Ozelot eat small animals. If they can, they can feed monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the Ozelot is hunting are much smaller than it itself.
Scientists think that ocelote animals to eat (prey) track and track with their sense of smell. They sniff after where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with a vision of the night and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by optically matching their surroundings and then plunge on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, when they move over a mountain chain or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so that the new population needs different characteristics or adjustments to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
In time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
This process we call specification, which simply means the emergence of new species. Specification is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, inhales people, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that emits people (that is, exhales).
Plants produce their food over the sun through photosynthesis. They also donate shadows.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. We feed mainly on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his way.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a bent tongue. He was feeding on turtles, big fish, other mosaics and maybe even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not up to him.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feast meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called seven-sleeper.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to hold common banquets with which they were on the side while eating their meals.
Old Rome dishes could not contain food that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no old Roman ever cost a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple, which was considered to be the house of God.
They offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple yard and then an inner altar room, which was only allowed to be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called Ciccurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place under the open sky.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops consisted simply of open shop counters to the street. Stein was used for building the house.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so that wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the old-fashioned words, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. When he continued to go west, he found Greenland and gave him the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "The Legacy of the Templars," you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the declaration of independence the words "original declaration of independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written. The text is more heady at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows with certainty who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29 ¾ inch x 24 ½ inch) was rolled together for storage at the beginning of his life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles have liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"He was dominated by the" Vichy "French. These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the South of France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizens, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in some way, defines the size of a society.
Urban states are the precursors of the nations. A civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a continuing cultural footprint and an appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical testimonies and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutions, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the Federal Treaty, which consisted only of Congress.
The Congress was not allowed to raise taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national justice, he relied on the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all his laws.
It also had no power to repeal tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all States before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was the FIFA World Champion in 2006.
The most popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water ball, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor sports.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Because of the cluster / group of islands, Japan was, is geographically often referred to as" archipelago. ""
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in the south-west of Taiwan, leading to a change in the grain cultivation methods of the native people and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and in 1885 declared Taiwan the province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat of the first Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it passed the sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the solar temple and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
Until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues until today.
For example, the world's most widely used stand image format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the prevailing film size at the end of the analogue film mära.
It is still being produced today, but it is even more important that its image format was taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height in a confusing way.
The side ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3: 2.
Many common formats (the GSP format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar side ratio.
The many-timed and often mocked third rule is a simple directive that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains a level of order in one picture.
It says that the crosspoint of the lines that have a vertical and horizontal image is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was on the test.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs says that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the funds of the churches are to be used for this very reason.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was met.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, the UK initiated a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective as it cut the country from vital military and civil supplies, although this blockade was contrary to the generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom has reduced international waters to prevent ships from being able to penetrate throughout the sea, which was even a threat to neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its full submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book with poems and a letter of recommendation by Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of showing different ages. Every period of time in China and every family in power was its own dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties there were also insolent times of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the epoch of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han- and the Jin-Dynasty.
In these times, bitter wars among many nobles fought for the throne.
The time of the three kingdoms was one of the most bloody epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
After the revolution, all the professions were open to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and best could redeem.
The same is true of the military, because instead of class membership, the army rankings were now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a lively image of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists. As soon as you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave there is very little to see or hear from this world.
The Cheoppyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built in the third century BC by the Egyptians, the Cheops pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built for the worship of late pharaohs.
The Gizeh plateau or the Gizeh necropolis in the Egyptian valley of the dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops wives and family members.
The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "cut" symbol looks like a clamp or a square where the lower line is missing.
Upward means you should start at the top and push the bow. Downward means you should start at the frog (this is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The painting usually generates a softer sound, while the painting is stronger and more expressive.
You can add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed arc markings are there for musical reasons, which is why they should normally be respected.
King Louis the XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, and her two little children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the sister of the King, Madame Elizabeth were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women in Versailles on 6 October 1789.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who made threats against the king and the queen.
The mob forced king and queen to open the windows of their carriages far.
At some point, a member of the crowd was waving the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenditure, and the interest on bonds went through the Wall Street bank houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits of the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people were the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the high middle age, an age in European history that extends over the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The high middle age was preceded by the early middle age, followed by the late middle age, which ends in agreement by 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human fate is determined by a underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other, that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than social.
One can say, for example, that the passenger car is essential to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, and new production methods are therefore being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the streets, which in turn leads to the invention of new health-care techniques for the repair of damaged bodies.
The romance had a strong, culturally deterministic element, which was made up of writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, it is the geography that formed individuals. Over time, customs and cultures related to this geography were created and these, as they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrary octroyed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
His status decreased over the twelfth century, due mainly to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the world's fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and the 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzanz in the east.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to fix clothes.
The need economy is agriculture, which aims to produce just so many food that it meets the needs of the farmer or the farmer and his / her family.
The subsistence industry is a simple, often biological type of cultivation, which uses saved seed, native to the Korean region and combines with interchangeovers or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield.
In the past, most farmers had a subsistence economy, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social standards and enable them to develop an identity feeling.
Subcultures may differ from others in terms of age, ethnic, class, place and / or sex of members.
The properties that distinguish a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called" wild "or wild. Some wild children were held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the significant intellectual or physical restrictions of the child."
Wolfskinder may have experienced massive child abuse or have had traumatic experiences before being exposed or running away.
Others shall have been raised by animals; some shall have lived in the wilderness alone.
When it was fully raised by animals, the wild child shows behaviors (within the scope of its physical possibilities) that are almost completely in line with those of its specific foster animal, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, "scaffolding" goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the small office clamp in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is integrated into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student alone may not be able to handle.
Children are accommodated in foster families for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the system of care is a piece of safety for these children.
Our family care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving carers, stable training and reliable health care.
The care centre should cover all the needs that they had not received in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the use and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and "continued relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video records led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpression, few milliseconds of long-term facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that you can see if someone is lying by showing minimal changes in the expression of the face correctly.
In his article The President's speech Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand language because of brain damage can still properly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behaviour may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation ensures new genetic variations and selection removes these variations expressed from the pool.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Outside in the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as the human to meet his need for amino acid from available plant sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if you fail to do so: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the Savannah today.
Sleeping understatement is the process of targeted wake-up during normal sleep periods and a short time of sleep (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to make you aware without fully arousing you.
If you are someone who presents the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on biorhythmus is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea known for its harnessing effect) before going to bed, so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The measure of inner rest, which a human being has, correlates in a reverse way with the measure of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can gain enlightenment. The only thing that is in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended to the path of the love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (reconnaissance energy) is awakened by yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of the Tibetan meditation is on God's yoga. By the visualization of different deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to a cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war, the clash of systems, the course and culture led to the countries being hostile.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last for the next 40 years and be carried out in reality by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and a reestablishment along the Romanian bridge head.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after they had entered the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Attack Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The mission of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while at the same time hindering the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring staff and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated in the Zāgros mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Antique cultures and folk tribes began to keep them as farm animals in order to easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that migrated on hills or other pastures. The goats were treated by goat-hikers, very similar to the more well-known sheep-hikers; often the children or adolescents were. These grazing methods are still being used today.
In the 16th century it was built in England.
Although the conveyor tracks were only made of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses who pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and to draw greater loads than on the somewhat rough streets of the time.
In the early days, thresholds were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, the realization was gradually made that rails that carry a band of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron provided more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known way of moving was walking. Man began to go up two million years ago with the rise of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, were not so regular.
Two-foot species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
This is in many cases just a symptomatic treatment. However, if you do not only want temporary solutions, we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed very much due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity and that the problems of overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people have become more serious.
After his adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap roadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Court of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that still exist are the oldest still existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs who have survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things on birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use the computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that you cannot immediately make a diagnosis.
The best sign of poisoning by ingestion may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this special poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable to parasite people.
Both predators and bedbugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or the housing of their hosts.
In the United States there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and visual nerve.
Studies have shown that women are likely to have MS twice as high as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in his own interest or in the interests of his child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the physical parents give up their parents' rights, so that another couple can take over the parenthood.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works with the help of the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies.
However, it is not only about experimenting, but an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also led by asking questions and carrying out observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all science issues, including psychology, were recognised.
With the loss of Greek language knowledge, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often largely based on the presence of physical cycles and their production by biological watch.x
Behaviour determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are self-sustaining oscillators, which even in the absence of external signals perform a time-consuming cycles.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to integrate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They carried out two experiments in which they marked either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material in question and whether the cells concerned are germ-channel cells.
Only mutations in germ-channel cells can be passed on to children, while mutations can lead to cell death or cancer elsewhere.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, the visit of parks and the learning of information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, the photography and the study of orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial cities by car to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose job is in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting, all are in some way linked to and support a transport system based on the private car.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has borne human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone is complaining about the transport systeme.x
In developed countries you will rarely hear similar complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such maladministration, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between the two.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, as one cannot predict driver behaviour with 100% safety.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically rough.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, the connections between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help to design, design and operate facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find efficient food and gender partners.
Most insects can fold back their wings along their body.
In this way they have a wider selection of small subhatches in which they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and day-old flies are the only insects that can't fold back their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the heart of the solar system's movements.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), was moving around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and most waterlike river on earth. It leads more than eight times as much as water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the earth, partly up to six miles wide.
A whole 20 percent of the water that flows across the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Reich, the Pyramids of Gizeh in their size and the technical perfection of their construction were never exceeded.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom were astonished by the monuments of their ancestors, who were at that time a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to people since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in their original form and can be removed with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, set out the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: the earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also set out the theory that they are turning into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe in its entirety consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillion of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
So, after his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has entered the background with the emergence of recent writing methods, so that it was pushed back in its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a sharpener.
You can be curious about what will become of the keyboard when something new comes up.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to put a core together with many protons and neutrons.
About as if you roll a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split again, a part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they will fall apart even if they are low or no one at all.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called a crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highland.
There could be more Mary on the near side, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to climb up to the surface.
In-depth theories focus on finding what moves and addresses people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and / or wishes that are being accepted in the course of their growing-up.
These theories are about what makes certain people want to do exactly the things they do and what influences in their environment make them do or do not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of need hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can be seen when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, performing performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and taking on employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual, who has to do everything differently than the team has done it and makes everything his own.
The team leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to disgust between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by the local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
"The" invisible team "is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organisation take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organisation? An objective for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used across all the departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be created.
As a result, the joint work of an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process of addressing customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organisations to become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, they limit the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumours affect the behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our heads.
KI is strongly associated with science fiction, but is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI includes the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples are control, the setting up of strategies and timetables, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines that focus on finding solutions to problems of real life.
The KI system is now often used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and military and has also been installed in numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of each school class. Often a teacher would like to bring her students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. The students can look at museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
To share an excursion virtual is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the capital of the state. The website is converted every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. Although at the beginning of their blog experience, students often have a sloppy grammar and spelling, but that usually changes when there is an audience.
As students are often a very critical audience, the blogauthor tries to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces the students to learn more about the world around them." The need to awaken the interest of the audience inspires the students to write wisely and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far outside the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and present their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and is characterized by a series of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further to the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoiled beauty of nature spreads in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more, Ontario is considered to be what is seen by outsiders as typical Canadian.
Large areas further to the north are rather thin and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canada has citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as the animal world is concerned, its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belonging to France and are known as luxurious seaside pools.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and in the Comoros and Mayotte it was very successful.
The European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is limited by the Sahel and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married, regardless of their actual family status.
The wearing of a ring is also helpful (only no one looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider to be an attack and that it is not unusual to be persecuted, packed at the arm, etc.
Stay consistent if you reject men and do not be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences, that does not mean that it is all right!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berberian fishermen in the 10th century before the beginning of the time calculation and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed them and rebuilt them under the name of Casa Branca only to give them up after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan built the city again as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who set up trade bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of tinnef are sold, but that's all for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside Gomas should be carefully planned to learn the state of the fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trackings in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese francs for the short drive.
This in combination with its relative inaccessibility has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction and has an airport due to its reputation, it is now an impoverished city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered world cultural heritage areas due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates's PBS special "Wonders of the African World."
The city is in strong contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has an Arab flair rather than an African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km ² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each of which supports a different animal world.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the sign of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has daily protection and entrance fees.
It may also be worth buying a wild card that allows access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name for the Hong Kong territory and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared with a shimmering beam diagram that is visible by the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong you should leave the island and go to the opposite bank of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is in close contact with newly acquired land along the North Coast.
This is the place the British colonists have made their own. If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangadean and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest, which is located within the Indian territory, is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle, which once covered the gangway level.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km ², of which one third is covered by water and marches.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal kingdoms and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave all day long from the cross-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those in the direction of the east and Jakar / Bumthang, leaving between 06: 30 and 07: 30.
As the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are run by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Collection taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a barrier bridge. It extends over the river Oyapock and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 m.
The passage height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the traffic was only released in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs control points will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited today's East Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also operated subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also the home of other groups of native tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who were through hunting, collecting and fishing survived.
Paraguay, formerly called the Great Province of Western India, was created in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and the players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December in Las Cañitas Polofelen.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.x
For information on competitions and sales points for polo-game tickets, see the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is determined in accordance with the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted all over the islands and at Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and US currencies can be accepted; please ask the owners in advance what payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is in the northern hemisphere winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. During the summer months temperatures above + 30 ° C are common.
The winter can be deceptively cool: the temperatures rarely go below the freezing point, but the wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no marked rain or dry times: the amount of precipitation remains the same over the whole year in about the same way.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the parking authority, visitors should stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, elk, bears and practically all the big animals can work, it can happen that they go to the attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and possibly dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also be aware that odors can attract bears and other wild animals. So avoid carrying or cooking strong fragrant food with you, and be careful to have a clean stock.
Apia is the capital of Samoa on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the '50s of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous naval patting in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships with the exception of a British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the chief chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III
As Auckland extends over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to Devonport to the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shadows donated by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the high suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overrun, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One." It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
The local tap water can be drunk without a need, but if you are worried, you will also find the water filled without any problems.
"For Australians, the idea of the coffee" Flat White "is foreign. A small black man is" Espresso, "Cappuccino is high filled with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and, in particular, focus on security warnings.
Craps occur near the beach and near the river's mouth from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveller the certainty that he will have a place to stay after his arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other accommodation forms, such as camping sites, by a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also hold your reservation back for you if you need time to review the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. Visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of the festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors think this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you must go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that in parts of the festival music is still played until late in the night, even if the music on the main stage has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
When you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking ice causes quite terrible noise for the most affected.
The cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are free of the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a great effort to keep guests on site for as long as possible and spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or watches, and outputs are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in a mood and make sure they stay.
Some playgrounds offer alcoholic drinks free of charge. However, drunkenness affects the judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
If you want to drive in high widths or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below the freezing point.
On icy and snowy roads the liability is low and you can't drive as if you are on naked asphalt.
In the case of snow towers, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or rushing snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle window.
On the other hand, icy and snow-rich conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues for the most part continuously throughout the year.
Safaris may be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" means a country trip in the usual use of language to observe the overwhelming African animal world, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to be close to cars, and the standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, cheers and leopards are often shy and you can watch them better with a binoculars.
A foot safari (also known as a "walk," "walking safari" or "walking") consists of a hike that takes either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other places throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city that has hosted two Olympic summer games, after it was the venue of the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.

There are various methods for cleaning water. Some of them prove to be more effective to address certain risks.
In some areas it is enough to cook water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a serious company.
Travelers can encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Ungives can destroy food, cause irritation, or even, at worst, cause allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force are not usually classified as ungulates.
Customs-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods which are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers with a high level of taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is probably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, unopened terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you will remain careful: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves prevail here.
The specified speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km / h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
But it is interesting to note that mobile coverage is much better here than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakers' goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as is the case with the southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are widely used, with apples being cooked all year round and cherries and plums used in summer.
Many German bakery products also include almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich baked goods, try what is called Berlin, pancakes or craps, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.

Aids for the feet of the horsemen, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are security concerns, because the rider's feet may be caught in them.
When a rider falls off the horse and is caught with his foot on the uproar, it can be dragged along when the horse goes through. In order to keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety hulls that make it possible for a stirring belt to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.

Departure sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports, where you can attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and drive down a slope over a snow-covered underground.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "skipenners," who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings with representations of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of the ski departure as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first free time ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing with backpack: This activity is also called skiing or skiing.
It is similar to alpine tour skiing or mountain climbing, but does not necessarily include it, as the latter are carried out in steep terrain and require much more firm ski and boots.
Consider the ski route like a similar hiking route.
In good conditions you are able to travel a little longer distances than when hiking - only very rarely you will reach the speed from cross-country skiing to well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. It is usually necessary to apply for visas on several occasions and to go through several passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross the borders without having to go through the passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Member States individually with a Schengen visa, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no general definition of which items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called "antique," although they are younger than similar products from mass production.
Reindeer farming is an important source of Sámi's living, and the culture around trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Even in the past, not all Sámi have grown large-style reindeer, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like. Reindeer held them mainly as migratory animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

Travelers are strongly warned to pay attention to any kind of storm affecting their territory, as this may affect all travel plans.
Anyone who plans to travel a country considered a war zone should have a professional training for it.
"An Internet search for" "course over hostile environments" will probably display the address of a local company. "
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here much more detailed, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes arms training.
There are numerous books and journals on the survival of the wilderness, but few publications on war areas.
Travelers planning a gender-related operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid ID documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified sex (X) or documents updated to the desired name and sex is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The search for security controls has also become much more urgent in the period after 11 September 2001.
Transgender persons before their operation should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing the scanners.
Rising currents are the return current of waves broken on the beach, often in reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast flow to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by overfatigue in the attempt to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, it's no harder to swim back than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you will not be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and depending on whether you have been noticed, you should perhaps wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon period is not so pronounced), takes longer and can be more serious.
It is sometimes particularly difficult for travellers who have had the opportunity to adapt to the new culture to adapt to their own culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to another culture and some behaviors of your home culture.
The first time you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers had to adapt in a new country.
It may not be expected that even returning travellers are required to be patient and understand.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it's quiet before the show starts.

Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded Caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, which is bounded by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula go over here to the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 m above sea level.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally no substitute for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in a clear line of view of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as expeditions that require data and language-distance connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people who plan to take a year off are study and course offers abroad.
This is particularly popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before the university without affecting their studies.

As a rule, a study fee is charged for the application for these education programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat tours. The "land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archives.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelago and the lakes.
Even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for each yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, each sixth or eighth has a boat.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty.)
Most pure Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while you return in the evening and stay on the ship.
If you only go ashore during the border tours, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer in their brochures Berlin in Germany as a destination. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of any age and from any area of life, especially if they have never flown or have a traumatic experience behind them.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: this is nothing but the personal fears and antipathies that have very many people.
To learn more about the operation of aircraft and the procedures during a flight can help some to overcome the fear that is related to the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Time is often a very important factor in company documents, commercial goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies, difficulties occurred.
When they sent things over air cargo, the unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get through it more quickly was to send it as an open luggage, and the airlines' rules do not allow you to send it without a passenger, and that is where you come in.
The obvious method of flying in first or business class is to throw a big batch of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your own company to take over the costs).
However, this is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for the business and the Elffache for the first class!
In general, it is pointless to search for only reductions for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of pilots who are ready to pay a lot of money and demand appropriate prices for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinau. The local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-appointed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member country.

The bark outside of the Paris disappears very quickly when you show basic manners.
The Plitwitzer Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, there are mainly books, spruce and fir and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
