Gutach: even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away from each other: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian temple at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall light.
Two plants so close together: intention or a sign-bourgeois prank?
This question was clearly answered yesterday by Guinach's mayor.
"The city hall light was installed at the time, because it secured the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants.
The plant, which was officially operational yesterday, was important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area "Grub."
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, a further light had to come in for their safety," said Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the State Council of Offenburg.
"According to current measurements on the B 33, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about 10% are heavy-duty traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another light is more than necessary: "Safety is just going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were held, a roundabout was also planned, but because of the narrow area in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße area was rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before in the location of the traffic lights: "By means of an extra transport loaded for us with particularly long logs of wood we have tested whether these vehicles can go out from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without changing the traffic lights."
The traffic light system itself, which costs about 15 000 euros, is "the most modern thing that is currently available on the market," explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that are so strong that the lights can be seen by the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older light systems use about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three light systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian pushes the traffic button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, it will come directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
"If a group or disabled people go across the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will come safely across the road," Arnold said.
Of course, the driver had to think as a partner here and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: The light for pedestrians was only a little bit green, a top-class vehicle was rushing through - with a light red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth of the soul.
The Carinthia poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village child - the inexpressiveness, the tendency to raw violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and unhappiness.
The winner of the book is especially known as a prosaauthor, theatre texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Weather Lamps on the Zungenspitze," which can now be seen in Garage X at St. Peter's Square, collage Gerhard Fresacher is therefore a collage of Prosatexten.
The theatermaker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigen" (1987) with prosamintures from "Leichnam, his family lurking" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important prop: a crunched sofa, on which the copulation and masturbating is pointed out - the eight-member ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overcomes the template with a wealth of control ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic play forms.
The actors in particular get to know the sometimes somewhat questionable scenical implementations.
They are touched hard, dipped with their head under water, put their evening robes on the wall.
Enforced into cellophane or bodice, they stink on dangerously high sticks through the production, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
The text is, however, hardly used in this hard way.
The best moments are the evening when the song is sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come to a little rest, and Winkler's after-all absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every mile of the road and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system of financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly opened up an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertaires have allied with environmental groups and are in favour of the government being able to use the small boxes for the recording of the hit kilometres - and possibly where they were driven - and then use the information for the calculation of tax deductions.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and has a number of data protection concerns.
But while in Congress one cannot agree on a procedure, several states no longer wait.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It is nothing we may only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles that have been driven by all the Californian car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes, is broke by the US-Americans paying at the pump column.
But in America, it's not as much gas as it used to be.
Cars use less fuel.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
With high fuel prices, politicians do not dare to raise the tax by a cent.
"The fuel tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most useful alternative in the long term," he said.
bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, for example, because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-harmful exhaust gases are reduced.
The California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally-based targets of the state on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also pleased with the idea of making drivers pay after a distance.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," says Adrian Moore, Vice President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in a report in 2011 called on Congress to move towards mile-based settlement.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million-worth pilot project last year, which would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and thus responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
However, several states and large cities are moving on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow any of its movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into adult surveillance devices."
There was no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can use to capture the kilometres that have been driven, but not exactly when and where.
That, according to Khan, would also make the public more well-founded.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company was originally not involved in helping state states to tax drivers.
Rather, it was their aim to take a stand in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles that have been driven.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee on the basis of the average miles travelled by all the residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax-based device that can also pay parking fees, have to pay insurance for only a few miles and to collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion.
"Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," it says in a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles using little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head of legislation and public affairs.
If we do, hundreds of millions of car drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team is fighting wacker
The volunteer fire brigade managed its autumn main sample despite the lack of staff with bravour.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
In his exercise, the department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate of Feder in the Burgberger Straße.
There a short circuit is supposed to have been created during sawing.
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respiratory protection carriers of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and to lead him into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and also straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for wood processing.
The first fire attack was carried out over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made over an overflow hydrant about 100 metres away.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what to do with little available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided through the Königsfeld day-to-day service group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, country president Guido Wolf was also able to find out in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, he studied this important issue together with the leading school leaders of the vocational schools and the district gymnasium and the parent board presidents.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans Thoma School, who presented the connected school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the promotion centre, the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre in the Walderstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a look at the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, the period to care for family care," Wolf said.
He also pointed out that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he said.
Another important factor was the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already met the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often remain in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the Land was convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the regional advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the south-west of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train trip from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport.
"Stay persistent and make public transport better," he said to the local politicians present.
A fun afternoon with music
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were served in the rest room.
This afternoon is now in the nursing home of St. Joseph.
The home people were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was a sausage salad.
With popular melodies, Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front of the old school yard in front of the renovation to the Kirchstraße is to be set again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, in the first works of the redevelopment of the front school, a small angle wall was installed, for the stabilization and static discharge of the natural stone wall over a hundred years old with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further action is to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be made by experts, which will then be put on the table to the municipal council for the decision and the decision of the further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year.
After the redevelopment, plastering and tree planting of the old school yard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, in the foreseeable future, as a follow-up measure, the redevelopment of the necessary barrier walls must be completely renovated and placed on new substructure.
The historical, one hundred-year-old wall of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße, is in need of renovation and has a bow tilt forward, mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage.
Deep cracks in individual stones show weather damage, but the wall is not at risk of falling.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by students, which has been done through the current fortification work.
Originally, the school was even planned for the years 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned expenditure led to a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for film recordings, will be spoken by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If the rules are to come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen is hoping for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now again taught in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now been involved in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir said the "Stuttgart News."
Jazz and classical music are just together at the jazz location in Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered a favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, is opposed to the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is pushing for a rearrangement of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
The study course Jazz and Pop is to be moved from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
US border: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs reported, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig out under the radar," said the U.S. Southern California General Attorney, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the one end of the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy said to the drug gangs: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77.000 people have been killed in the context of drug crime in Mexico.
Designed by experts
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped so that electric vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side is the access in a building that is 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration in the direction of the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine finding.
The third, a Mexican, was caught for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are under threat of life-long deprivation, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, and the press conference in San Diego continued.
It was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This is shown by the "despair" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details of the prisoners were announced, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
You'll have to be in prison for up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger Festyear
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in about eight weeks, the anniversary year will come to an end.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches a document was made, in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there is to be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
In the context of the anniversary, a number of events are planned in both geisingen and church houses.
In July, on a holiday weekend from 18 to 20 July, the church-houses will be the 1250.
Celebrate the return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
On this weekend there is also the church-house festival.
The city music director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On June 21, together with the Sunday party of the Schwarzwaldverein, on July 12 in the arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last week of September, on the 27th and 28th of September.
A new chronicle will be published on the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee.
"It is to be a chronicle not only of the violin itself, but a printed work about today's violin, which consists of the violin, church-houses, leopterdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the violin of today also celebrates its birthday in 2014, in 1974 the present space with the congregations was completed.
The new chronicle will be presented in the new Festhalle in Geisingen on November 21 or 22.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrrengrunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a brewing evening on the occasion of its 60-year-old existence, the harmony of Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and on 29 March has the banquet and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The old-age work Leiperdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the music club Polyhymnia Leiperdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Brunnenfest from July 4 to 7.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift document, which is in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then court court.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly in 2014 is also the town reform 40 years ago.
Council is targeting track installations
Should the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing be extensively redesigned to increase road safety?
Yes, the councillors have decided.
Schiltach must take over EUR 220 000.
The Deutsche Bahn is planning to improve the Kinzigtal line next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they must take part in the costs with one third, and the rest share the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhäger explained to the council the special features of the Bahvergang "Am Hirschen."
There the city plans to build a buoyancy at the height of the tunnel mouth there to the west of the railway tracks.
There could also be larger vehicles, for example those that transport long-wood, in the event of cross-traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhäuser therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was controversial in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, put the critics' mood at the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing "Hirschen" was used regularly for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area was partly transported over this line, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the line on the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
As it is to be expected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the crossing of the "Am" Hirschen "could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have them examine the costs of the planned expansion of the road.
Despite this, the majority of the amendments to the railway crossing were agreed on the condition that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could, if necessary, extend the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to about 5.5 metres for meeting traffic.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem, which concerns access to the strongly rising "Geroltshäuser Weg."
The administration had the railway redesign plans examined by the engineering office of Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltshäuser route would be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it should not be excluded that the tilt of the road could lead to longer vehicles being installed.
The city is responsible for this in turn as a road-building carrier.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the bending were working in the current state of construction, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
Also at this point the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other crossings, because the centre stop is directly next to it, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be stopped at this point already so far that no collision would threaten.
A majority of the members refused to agree to the change of the railway, as the city of Schiltach had to "take out" the problem with on-board vehicles, the councils said, as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work was completed.
The board considers the changes to the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" railway crossings, for which the crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on large space emissions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1000 planets on other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows if there are lives on at least some of them.
The selection is difficult: should one look for gravitational waves?
Or rather to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover alien life?
The European Space Agency, Esa, is in the process of asking these questions.
For their program "Cosmic Vision," they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which should make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for such "L-Missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
There were 30 ideas to be discussed, five of which have now come to a closer choice.
A large number of bodies examined the proposals and followed up with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, launched in 2007, will find answers.
What are the conditions for the development of planets and life?
The exact processes of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
In order to look into this question, the "Cheops" space telescope will start in 2017, which will further examine 500 well-known planetary systems in our near environment.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could depict Earth-like planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres and thus look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is to finally give an indication of the conditions for the creation of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation from it with the planetary system play an important role.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a M-Class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is to start in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
The researchers are also very interested in Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa is the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is intended to study the atmosphere of the planet, as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also differences that could show the physicists the way to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter of stars, planets and living beings like us, there are dark matter, the gravity of which is holding together galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, by whose action the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first few seconds of the Big Bang, nor what Dark Matter and Dark Energy consist of.
With "Euclid," the Esa has already approved an M-mission, the launch of which is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa," has the best chances of obtaining an L-mission, a demanding concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Among these, physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been shown to this day.
Elisa could do this, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on Earth, it could also prove gravitational waves that were created in the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights about the development of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," which is to track and investigate Earth-like planets.
There have already been proposals for the return of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, and for solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US Intelligence Service, said he was ready to go to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not give answers about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum has been received to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented by Ströbele to the media in Berlin on Friday, he writes: "Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of faith and tries to criminalize political expression with criminal threat, in which no defence is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The US Ministry of Justice's charge includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that NSA has heard the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, said that the opportunity should be taken to hear Snowden as a witness if this was possible "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US."
Ströbele, a Green Member, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden is in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, the honourable Member said.
In his letter, Snowden explains that he is exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that has driven him out of his home country.
He was, however, touched by the global response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world and high-level politicians - including in the United States - have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines is planning to demand up to 100 US dollars from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday had to read that passengers should keep the whole can.
The new fee is for hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small pockets under the seat are still free.
Frontier said that if the fee is paid in advance, it will be charged 25 US dollars and 100 US dollars for passengers who only paid at the gate.
Front speaker Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at moving travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she said.
In 2008, airlines began to charge for the first and second items of baggage.
Passengers who tried to circumvent these have therefore stuffed as much as possible into the hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about making money.
It was about the most faithful customers of Frontier who had clearly expressed that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a piece of luggage free of charge at the Frontier gate, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar piece of luggage.
O'Malley said that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures were changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the gate.
The new hand baggage fee from Frontier only comes into force in the summer, there is not yet a precise date.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to use them.
They argue that the transport of the luggage would cost money and that passengers would pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most, however, have so far left the hands of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed three years ago as the first fee for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost plane.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
In a report of December 2011, he estimated that the hand-luggage fee Spirit would bring in US $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who had previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious what would be expected of him on the gate if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand baggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most smooth I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth crunching and practical discussions on the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like a grudge."
Frontier also follows spirit with the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice would be allowed to keep the whole can and that coffee would be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had briefly tried to ask for money for soft drinks, but did so seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other large company had followed.
Frontier's step to charge for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the most recent initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay on-line travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to spend only half as many frequent-flyer miles on booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were once again reduced to 25 percent of the route.
A flight trip with a frontier of more than 1000 miles booked with a third-party provider therefore only brings customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve places only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The revenue went down 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report published by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Protestant church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "proverbs from the Bible" and "expressions from the Middle Ages."
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, went into the biblical proverbs after breakfast in a lecture.
"Proverbs contain wisdom of life, regulations or warnings," she said.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding passages of the Bible and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: "The eyes of wood are watchful, as the scales fall from the eyes, to put an eye on someone, to whom is the Lord in his sleep, to wash his hands in innocence."
On several occasions the speaker also had her listeners advise on what proverb it was.
The speech from the Middle Ages was taken up by the church councillor Christel Dehner: all good things are three, make blue, beat something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the speeches she called "bridges to the past."
In the end, a tombola was lured.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before being handed over to the winners.

Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry is being launched at the Mecklenburg Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry will be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winter periods.
"It is new that the six-month courses end with qualifications," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits were many: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA states that an "internal error" and not a hacker is the fault of the crash of the website
The shady National Security Agency declared late Friday that a mistake had put its public website down for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in an email message.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users.
A NSA spokesman had previously explained to ABC News that the Authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
The speaker said that secret information was not in danger.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have shrunk the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not used to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname once was No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the light of the public and is now exposed to sharp criticism after the revelations of its extensive surveillance program in Germany and abroad that have become known in recent months - a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the intelligence service was a source of initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
While the quota is 3.1% better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have so far reacted to attitudes.
According to FeldBauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any professionals in the craft sector, in the health sector and in the care of the elderly."
As a result of the annual period, job opportunities for staff in the hotel and restaurant sector have been resumed since September.
In mid-December the winter season begins there.

Profit loss for Bombardier after decrease in delivery numbers and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decrease in net profit after being under pressure from declining orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, did not publish any flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could be used for commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September.
The pilot's maiden flight a month and a half ago only three more starts have been followed so far, which makes it seem doubtful whether the test phase will run as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the limited potential of the share in the next one to two quarters.
"Although the number of aircraft is expected to be weaker, we are clearly disappointed in the development of margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft race will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are correct.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The management of the company also assured analysts and media that the programme was on the schedule on Thursday.
"The test plane was no longer on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the service life of the aircraft ground tests and software updates had been set.
Every manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then set up a revision period, which we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, and the remaining one shortly after, it was said from the company side.
However, analysts remain sceptical about whether the first customer can put an aircraft of the CSeries into operation 12 months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it will review the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if it is obviously in line with Bombardier's internal planning - strengthens our view that the start-up is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, with the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged for 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, said Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims to have delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
The net orders dropped from 83 aircraft to 26.
The number of orders in the aerospace sector on 30 September was 32.9 billion dollars, unchanged from 31 December.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our requirements, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector increased by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on September 30, a slight increase on December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by the problems of settlement in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share went down by 8.5 percent and was $4.83 Canadian, after it was also announced that the Google financial board Patrick Pichette will change to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10% decrease in the quarter's profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown man fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at LAX airport.
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security man had also been killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed about the situation, said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses said that they saw a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveller told the station CNN that many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and children cried.
Among the waiting people, panic had broken out, many would have hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveller of the "Los Angeles Times."
A member of the TSA security department had suffered a gunshot at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie."
After that he was taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots were said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On TV pictures we saw a lot of ambulance and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought out of the building to safety.
Users on Twitter released photos of a special mission and a gun on the ground.
As the airport management reported via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, formed a long back-up.
It was said that, except for landings, air traffic had been temporarily stopped.
However, several aircraft were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles's LAX airport is a major airport in the United States.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned drug boss about police investigation has to go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information to underground size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided under-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug-trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The "first-class" lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police had overseen Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials observed Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar room dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used class A drugs after having found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards during tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unlawfully information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later, after the police secured a number of house searches of heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he was afraid that his drug addiction could be made public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for impeding the justice.
He admitted the possession of cocaine in a previous interview.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage can.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly called Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium at dinner in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after having been discovered in class A tests in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client and claimed that her discussion was subject to "law secret."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said he was running an office under his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In the court it was announced that he had called important drug-trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal attorney should know better than anyone that you don't break the law."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but that of a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his messages were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted as far as possible to counter the police investigation, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta misled his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out any misconduct and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but would do so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said, "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to fade behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation of Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he found himself guilty of the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other 'people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total 153 years' imprisonment for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job as a lawyer was to represent clients in the death cell in America, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year-old existence, the Liederkranz Dunningen is surrounded by two divine services with the "German Fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life," which inspired the audience in the spring of this year, at the end of the anniversary year the Liederkranz will enrich two divine services with the performance of the German Fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be held from 19 during the evening Mass in the St. Martinus Church in Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 am at the service in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass," D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The Mass is listed as part of the service, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the group of the music club Frohsich Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism is becoming more and more confident
The elections to the parish council in 2015 will, for example, change in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For there is nothing more to change the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is for the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new one, however, is hesitant to see a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the chief officials of the pastoral team were sufficient.
Regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law, which will enter into the rights and obligations of the so far six individual church communities.
There will only be a common parish council and a board of foundations in which the priest Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members of each parish are to be represented, and in the six parishes there are so-called local community teams.
In the future, it will be their task to promote the ecclesial life in the place.
In the question of the finances of the individual parish, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets in the parishes will be maintained in order.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire municipality.
In particular, with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which then all the parishes made, there was a great deal of concern.
"In the past, too, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone have been invested," said Haslach's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
In practical experience with a joint body for five parishes, Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made themselves the task of "becoming one, five" in 2006 and had to find that this is not so easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher pastoral unit then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be made more concrete in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
In the end, the parish council of Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Poullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Poullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Poullendorfer family will be charged 70 to 90 Euro per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is set each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity routes.
These measure the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can charge by means of a levy on electricity prices.
The town works of Poullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," said Bias, where the number will be close to the 2 cent.
Stamp on permanent red: watch for waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light sign is defective.
Then what do you do - drive in red?
If a affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorcycle."
However, the waiting period had to be "appropriate," which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to stay out of it for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic light is expected.
However, he who continues the journey despite the red lights must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
If you wait for less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light breach.
The traffic light was not defective, but a little later turned to green.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Municipal Council is pleased about sound budget
When it comes to the household in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The community bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt is no longer known to the administration since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be recorded as a full success in this sense.
This became clear in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was about EUR 7.6 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also about EUR 1.8 million, about EUR 1 million above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher industrial tax revenues and the share of the municipality in the income tax.
The balance of assets was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
As in the financial year 2012, less investment has been made than planned, the amount of the provision of reserves has also been higher.
In total, the general reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were very happy about the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that the citizens could soon get to be expensive.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able in the past to renounce high lifting rates.
This in turn, however, according to Gerster, had already been reduced by the country several times.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory sticks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must show certain rates of increase.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, as there will be investment in the coming years, for which we would like to have grants," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Werstädte in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's history at the men's singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Werstädte was on stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing association.
Even after 60 years, he still has a lot of fun singing with the choir that is now more than sweet.
In the association, Werstädte was also active, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
He was awarded several awards for his commitment and for his experience in the association: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Referentant on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, gave him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German choral association and a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honours, the 31st autumn festival was held in common tracks: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singer's department Baisingen and the local music club, the full-marines had invited a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which were held by the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like "In the wine paradise" and "Funny, you brothers."
They prepared for their honors Hubert Werstädte a little time - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundessong."
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerbeuförderung" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley."
The Liederkranz Salzstetten, with his mixed choir and his group of women - the "Impulse" - provided the women's rate of the festival.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan folk style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus, took to foreign countries, while the "Impulse" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to the local area with "What isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Biersong," where the full-maringer music club offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small side program - "Granny Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casperltheater and read a few stories that the children did well for lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day-care centres in the Zollernalbkreis receive post in these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the savings bank Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the institutions in the realization of their construction and beauty wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day-care centres and crèches from the entire customs district can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or beautification wish for your facility, you can apply with this one to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 Euro and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many diligent building workers.
What's the matter with the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the savings bank Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what does Parliament stop simply from abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very criminal and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and to send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, "effectively takes the media into a stranglehold." The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya, on the other hand, wrote "a serious blow," and called the draft "draconian."
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they released pictures of security cameras on which the units sent to the scene were supposed to rob the luxury mall.
Police Commissioner David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a media call.
Under the new law, media houses can be subject to a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "already a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy."
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on the "lively blogosphere" of Kenya.
If they shut up the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"If you leave politicians to themselves, they will lead the country into bankruptcy and we will return to the time of the hunters and collectors," he said.
The Kenyan legislators have already in the past been in public trouble.
In May, they agreed to undo the cuts ordered by the national remuneration commission and put their firm salaries of about 550,000 shillings into effect free of tax per month - they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
The importance for the city and the football club was not affected by the official opening ceremony for the artificial grass sports field, despite the cold weather and the rain.
A more pleasant ceremony had all wished for last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This was done by the musicians who framed the ceremony, just like some of the speakers.

His thanks were mainly due to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the participating companies and members of the club who joined.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The angry pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the member of the parliament, Karl Rombach.
Further words of greeting were given to the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South-Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth division of the club.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that in the spring and autumn, ever-recurring weather-related influences added to the original lawn square so that he could not be played.
15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when the construction of a third place was thought of at the grounds of the football club or at the real school on the Salinensee.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, thoughts came up on the creation of an artificial grass sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbacht, a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place, and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 to the total cost of EUR 560 000, together with Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 by 108 m artificial grass square was started on June 4.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic metres of earth were taken off, half of which was used for the installation of a Dirt bike line.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
In addition, the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is a question of direct democracy, of bribery and of the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its work.
This should include, among other things, the issue of double citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the need for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union is opposed to a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its No to a passenger car toll required by the CSU.
A vignette was a "flatrate for frequent driving and therefore environmentally counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator on the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evasive traffic on land roads, which were already the main areas of the accident.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would be only a first step from Pronold's point of view.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later stage," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing frogs on the open-air stage

Car drivers seriously injured in the event of an accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempen outer ring towards Grefrath around 9: 15.
When she wanted to turn left on St. Töniser's street, she overlooked the coming car of the 37-year-old.
The fences collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after accident at the Schäzlekreisel
The accident had occurred according to the police, when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday night, around 8: 00 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße, drove to the city.
Shortly before the roundabout on the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand side of the road towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right-hand lane.
It was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Constanz.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged.
In total, about 15000 damage was caused, the police reported.
The road had to be closed during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport abrogates passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In future, the Vienna-Schwechat Airport will no longer be able to say the same thing.
A large part of the speakers' announcements are thus lost - the noise level should be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting of announcements concerning individual persons.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up the noisy calls.
The failure of these announcements - on average, in one day, about 200 personal calls by the speakers - will make it easier in the future at the airport.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information on changed flights or departure times is going down a little bit," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
High-lander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car pulling with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from September 6 to 8.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they have a weak eye on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters measure each other in the fields of tree progeny, horseshoe and water ice.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
"It does not matter how far it is," explains the organizer Peter Saile.
The strain must be thrown down vertically, should once overlay and then come straight to lie down.
This is rated with most of the points.
When throwing horseshoes, it depends on the target accuracy.
From eight meters away, it is thrown on a stake.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the water bucket carrying over 50 meters.
The amount of time and water in a bottle is measured at the end.
Two of each "clan" or team are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
Training can be done from 10: 00.
A suitable clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors can compete in the bulkhead.
But also Swabian performance is allowed.
For the "Outfit" the jury still gives a few bonus points.
You can register until an hour before the competition starts.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander-Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has already been announced at the festival on Saturday.
In the evening, the Blasmusikfreunde are at their expense.
At 7: 00 pm, the birabohemian bubble music from Schömberg is the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays the fleet of Polkas and Marches.
The repertoire also includes emotional waltz and a good big-band sound.
Heinz Koch from Weilen will be present as a singing host and blackwurstbaron.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fool's foot.
On Sunday, the music club Leinstetten is active for early shopping, from 2 o'clock, the "Bürgerkapelle Böffingen" is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the festival stop.
The start is already on Friday the Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf.
Other programme points include the vintage and towing meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday include the corn labyrinth, the craft market and sheep shears.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw-hop castle, tractor-driving (under instructions) and tractor-surfing.
The organizers are the Vereinigungsverein Mehrzuschhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Fünfkäpsele."
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Püriten tofu with plant cream, for example, is a set of quarkers.
Other names are the Vegetarian Federation on the World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on November 1, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, and yoghurt is replaced by sojajogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Raspable plant cream replace traditional whipped cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
A half-crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
The dough is loosened instead of with egg, for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soyayogurt or silkworm can do this.
According to the Vebu, some 800 000 people in Germany currently feed vegan, i.e. purely plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald-Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already offered, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
As a result of the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but, faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep," the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry on the second day and climbed on foot.
Then it went through the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students from the 373-metre-high observation platform of the Empire-State-Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city and enjoy the view.
After that, it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the day of school at Weymouth High School.
This year, a Hubertusmesse is celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Hunting Hornbleser group of the Hunting Leaders of Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth music on parforcehorns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The blasts wear riding clothes, because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog-men in the musical hunting.
The ceremony will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30.
The newly designed opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to the lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of the visit of the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the University of Applied Sciences Rhein-Waal, it does not have to remain with the pure déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly this goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but also to make it easy to experience it again and again.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A view into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at once.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top pampered the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually decorated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as a gastronomer before the opening of the beautiful café at the Opschlag: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge."
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag, the friendly café lovers are hoping for more audience.
Not least through the university.
"We do not have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
In fact, the two students here want to be as young as the elderly and all the age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew itself in various variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino-drinker.
"In addition, a baguette - this is my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
I'd better say one.
Because the port festival was rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps this is why Daniel Büttner is not a spoken fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right."
And with an event I always only address those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception to us.
"We would like to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
It means that Déjà Vu is also a reliable man.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the joy of many clever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the restaurant and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks to the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Feast to that of the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club's restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker all enjoyed the harmonious cooperation in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right strength to perform honors.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was given this time to the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written a lot for us, but have also made a few rounds for us, for this our warm thanks," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity shrubs went this year to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.

The board of directors was particularly grateful to the team of the club manager Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had made an extra-class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choral rehearsals at 7.45 pm on Tuesdays.
"New happy voices are always welcome to us," said Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is now starting to develop a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for the fight against poverty, announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the drive for "sustainable development goals" to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They have been included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to "think about national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to start a process with which universal, sustainable development objectives should be agreed," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals. "
Even though SG Achim / Baden has been without a victory for four days, there is still a good mood for the handball-top-level player.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
All of them are still fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes," he expects a success experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II
Even though the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out trees, in the run-up to it, Malmon raises the index finger with a warning.
I have trained many players myself in the A-Jugend.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait and see if there is any backup from the first," the SG-Coach explains.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the previous performances.
Especially in the field of cover work and in the game of switching, it was a huge one at the last.
The exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their heads off during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique to vote for peace calls in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the Independence Square of the capital.
For two weeks now, there have been reports of clashes between government and Renamo, which are one of the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the South African apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 Treaty of Peace, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into an adult conflict, but recent events have concerned foreign investors and locals.
A lot is at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal deposits in the north-west could bring in over the next few years investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blames each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Renamos stronghold on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, explained Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to put down concerns about instability.
To AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser," who "wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as renamo abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He said to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions that have been caused by a number of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are pounding their heads together," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and a Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for election reforms, has already stated that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a disgraceful movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made restless attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use for the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga replied with a reservation to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo "wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
The instability had increased the frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been worried about corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent wave of abduction.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protestor, said people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life," an author says.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are "far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools," so Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" of old-age works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who are "overly didactic," children would "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories, the messages would be "submissive."
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immense sense of good and evil.
This must be presented in a subliminal way, through which history is revealed and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob received his retirement in Haslach; on Sunday, his last years were alive in the "Freihof."
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the very short-lived scene game.
From the arrival to the award of the honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjako actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience with him as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and over-the-board time jumps from the youth to the coming retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, to his free court.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his paradise role as a great son of the city.
He moved in with the two-spanner and "Schwarzwälder Foxen" by Erich Becher from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann was very good at getting involved in the sister's role, and gave her in the mimics and gestures of immense life.
The Mühlenbacher Bürgerkapelle played a suitable selection of music pieces between the individual games scenes and thus rounded off the performance.
In order to award the honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honour, who, in representation of the then official Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his maintenance.
The three-king singers who led Hansyakob to the exclamation then made their maintenance: "Oh, how beautiful, there are young people's memories of my own three-king time again."
With their song "O Jesuein" they enjoyed the audience in the open court as well as the stork day children with their loud "coming out, coming out."
At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church in the same way as his concerns about the exuberance in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the Heimatude, behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praising words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances for the league remains of the sporty relegated Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wild card procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project does not have an application for a possible post-war area.
"We will not take part in the Wildcard process," said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City since 2012.
However, a first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We were not dealing with the Wildcard procedure, so long as it is not certain that Düsseldorf will not receive a license," said Neckar-Giant-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until May 23, the climber Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove his economic Bundesliga-fit.
To date, however, the licence has been refused to the Rhine countries twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The Church of the Supper is in the spotlight
As a contribution of the city to the 150-year-old standing of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the cultural and tourism office of the city is dedicated to the last of its public tours of this year on Sunday, October 27, the evening church.
After the visit of the nuclear cellar museum, the Haigerlocher period after 1850 is to be considered when the Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The final point is a visit to the Church of the Supper.
There the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a through and through Catholic area.
Last but not least, the view of the evening painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter falls in the church.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at 3: 00 am at the Atomkeller Museum.
There are cards at the register of the nuclear cellar museum.
The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US scout.
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Agency Interfax by reference to unspecified groups familiar with the situation.
It was said that such a question could be resolved in the intergovernmental context.
A trip out of Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he is losing his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden is threatening the extradition there, it said on
Long breath pays off

In the end, the endurance of the team Maier / Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun at the tennis game was the focus of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each other.
The game was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Klimpter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the well-known hands of Anja Schmitter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner were with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the victory ceremony, Carmen Müller was able to hand over the hiking pokal to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.

The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphalleicher.
In late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful end of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freelichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday programme, to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous co-actions and events.
"Large and small can learn different old crafts on both days," it says in the press release.
Whether to make soap, to turn candles, to make felt or to make ropes, for every age there is the right thing to do.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop is also a trade union.
The young guests can prove their craft skills when building cuckoo-paws, waterwheels or roundabout.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow races or stilts, also promise a lot of fun.
We need speed and coordination here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12: 00 and 14: 00 each.
On a tour of the money, the children have to guess which stories are true or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest Foxen.
Not only horses, but also many other animals, such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens, are to be found on the grounds and are to be admired.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Och on Sunday, who is driving his scrubber neck with the museum guests from 11 o'clock.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is in the middle of a pleasant and fairytale.
The storyteller takes the small guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11: 00, 13: 00 and 15: 00.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30.
In addition, on both days of the event from 11 am to 5 pm, numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the close-up woman, the spider, the weaver and the baker can be seen over their shoulder in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand small town, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovely kauz because he has planned to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
In spite of a heart failure, Burt is not to be disbanded from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations, and a mortgage on his old factory scales, he is transferred to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film, there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen bothers residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They're distributing the coal coming from the ships to the heap.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard, among other things, relies on wind systems logistics.
The coal in the storage area in front of the dike is shimmering in black.
Two huge blue hand-held and rechargeable chargers distribute or load the coal here as required.
With each movement of the transducers, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this is a long way to hear in the event of the unfavorable wind - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the City Order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it was now necessary to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
He will continue to focus on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on the coal import for power plants and is one of the major in Europe.
Thanks to the sunbathing pan in front of the terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can be made here for a long time.
"This year we want to crack the 3 million-ton mark during the envelope," Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on the ground, the imported coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant were to go to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player despite the first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the huge optimism of the basketball players of the FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning the best team in Europe in the last two years," Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic, accounting for the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munich people sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first made the piece of art to convert a 15-point backlog 13 minutes before the end into a tour before Piraeus once again turned the game around.
"We have fought back unbelievably against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made again reckless mistakes," said Bayern-pro Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
In the first two games, Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful advertisers of the Munich-based group, who had made clear victories in the first two games against the Italian serial master Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title carrier Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: a few hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays Innovation was developed, as was the case at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival is set up and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution of Caroline, this year's ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Caroline and then became more and more successful until they were too well known to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event will include performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy-benefit event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby perform.
The world of comedy has also grown with the festival.
A number of the comedians who take part in the festival this year have become known by rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast for both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," although she is most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racial-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's largest visitors is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a prestigious television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a TV show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me if he's here, he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here."
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiations process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN Vetomätten and Germany.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to clear the differences of recent years," said Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end both sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill playmates with machete
Two children admitted to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go on a bird hunt with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body in a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive beach village of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger, who had taken her with her, was to testify that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the crime before the police without mention of an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.

Pimp must go to prison
The Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative trafficking, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous assault.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession within the framework of a process agreement.
He therefore met women in five cases via Internet or phone contacts, which he sent to the line after a few weeks against their will.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
He kept the income of the women who, in part, for years, had paid for him.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undersigned women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who transferred the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them monitored in part to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the mental restriction and thus of a limited ability to be guilty, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any more of the injured women.
As a police officer reported, after a first ad, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking could be identified by telephone surveillance measures.
The intercepted talks had been marked by high aggression.
In later interviews the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered bruises all over the body, had not made any statement to this day.
It is a "completely broken personality," who sees violence and exploitation as normal in this metier.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He had left these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues to rise to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in China is growing.
The reference raw wood for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel in the late morning in Europe in the electronic trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price fall of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has put a burden on prices in the past few weeks.
The US Energy Ministry said on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of the Chinese economy, which had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Brent crude oil, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by US refineries, fell by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD's stop-and-hairs directive
On Thursday, a federal court of appeal in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-hairs programme ("stop and search") of the New York police department, and removed the judge from the case.
The 2nd US Appeals Court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheidlin were suspended until a decision was taken on an appeal of the city.
The judge had in August ruled that the city was contrary to the Constitution by the way in which the programme for the maintenance and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the measures to be taken, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and the relevant training programme.
The appeal court heard the arguments on the required suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the code of conduct for US judges by ensuring that a judge should avoid the appearance of the party, partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the Court's criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-hairs program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and the supervision of services, and appointed a pilot programme with body-borne cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
An oral trial on the city's appeal is planned after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactics were criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
This type of control has been in various forms for decades, but the number of controls recorded during the term of office of the non-member mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who were members of all the minorities were brought before the Court of Justice, who became a collective action.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-hairs programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force and influence the way other police leaders use the regime.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; even money would be wasted and the wider problem of a police force that was under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade would not be solved.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-hairs practice, which was constitutional, but only reform the way in which the NYPD controls were implemented.
From the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels
With this wisdom of need, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands."
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
In 2004, he was in Mauritania for the first time at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the operations on a large screen were shown, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Henne, to operate at the association in an advisory capacity.
In 2008, in the record period of just under a week, the Schleeh carpentry from Baiersbronn created the Sickstation in Socogim, a poor quarter on the edge of the capital - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which the birth clinic in Nagold is to be wegrationalized.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical man, says Henne, for example, to slow down against burn-out.
Because of the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to travel as many as planned, but for that many doctors came to Germany to host here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as in March this year medical devices, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a lot of local colorite by telling Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat's house and by describing the experiences of the Stammheimer musicians, who traditionally support the club, on their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of audit as a young Member of Parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special consultant" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemail and followed her, but Coulson also called her and left messages as the court heard.
"According to the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one in front of the home of people and hopes to catch them on a fresh act, but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW used three procedures to investigate stories in an investigative manner: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, it can't be any other way.
How about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "I don't know if he knew."
Rumours about an affair of Clarke were first taken up by the feature editor of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band of voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
At the time of the research, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls when they were asked for information about them, Edis said.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis said that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Blunkett for an affair with a married woman when he was himself in partnership with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have pledged to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned tax on the Empire, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A clearing meeting is about to end without results.
In the conflict over the tax on the Empire, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred into a dead end after a failed clearing meeting.
President François Hollande received and listened to their complaints on Thursday at the Élysée Palace in Paris.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75% tax on income of more than EUR 1 million per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the head of the Association of Profiklubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, informed.
The days of the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 are therefore off.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens Hveller opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
"The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood, which hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, was a major event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, he said.
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-up land as possible is the goal," said Höller.
It is based on the planning of the protection against a flood that is expected to be statistically every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima."
The water masses, which had caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009, were equivalent to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Höller.
In order to achieve the HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect state grants of around 70 percent.
However, he pointed out that the support would only be provided if an overall approach was implemented.
For this purpose, the community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, the specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who introduced the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, one should find the most economical solution, says Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was a lot of displeasure with the residents of the resort, who, even in normal thunderstorms, have to suffer from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, HVersler pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three year-old regeneration events could be carried out.
To measure the sewer channels larger would devour millions.
Serious injuries after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on the national road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could say little about the accident.
However, there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is certain that the 19-year-old leader of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman being so badly encapsulated that the fire department needed almost half an hour to get them out of the car wreck.
The actual cause of the accident at first remained unexplained.
Both of the people who were injured came to nearby hospitals.
The line remained completely closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysical, and his novels and stories also have something serial.
The family in the outside is amazing: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is quite true in his own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells two-and-a-half.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security delusion and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had experience of God, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, and he had drugs on his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime," that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is like our own, mutants are looking to the future - and the police are coming.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll get them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, and for that we have a criminal camp full of pesudo criminals." They read time flows.
They assume that evil is happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into practice.
Dick's story is like the blueprint for the NSA's anti-terror laws and the NSA's listening.
Anticipating the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The chief of police is complaining that there is no more division of power, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself will be monitored and a future crime will be committed.
The system is going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Not only does mistakes and victims take place, but they build on it.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Scatter to testify to Merkel in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US scout about Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia in person, the agency reported Interfax.
Previously, the Green House member Hans-Christian Stöbele had met the first German politician Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations strengthen company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and the fight against terrorism (BAT), the German internal secret service, he was to photograph the roof of the US external post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to demonstrate the presence of monitoring agents and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the US did not use any opportunities of foreign piracy "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or their profit."
But since Edward Snowden, the former Whistleblower, began to publish his full horn of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at the floor.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company's paranoia to a new level because of state surveillance.
The barrel was overrun by the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management is certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now at almost the same risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published in July by the consultancy company EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence to date that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU was lacking certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, we should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the range and technical refinement of the US spy authorities discovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the largest spy risk in China.
There is a major change in cloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US are subject to the case law there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism, about 10 percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, the deputy managing director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago - it is: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will stay physically in this legal area?"
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise.
It's always been.
"It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the company is not usually boasting about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that gives the assailants advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a fair or unguarded letting a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been part of the standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they can not be used as a listening device.
The German BAT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," the BAT warns in a report.
The US is warning its own companies about economic piracy by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, in the US National Intelligence Estimate, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second among the countries that used to procure hacking economic data.
A board member of a German Blue Chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that, even if they work together in the fight against terror, all countries are spying on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can do," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony was successful now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
There were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro-look has moved back in again.
It starts with the wedding dresses, for example.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front, the clothes that are often covered with embroidery are closed, often with a veil, but in the back they go down the back and often end in a tug.
But the spirits, as Stefanie Koch points out from the fashion house Wärmüller, divorce.
For men the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be chosen cream or brown combinations.
The selection of the place was important, was explained.
The rooms are not perfect, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the area.
If you want to go by coach, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"Carts are also popular for boys' clubs," he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "After-Wedding-Photo" - that is, recording series in special places, preferably for example waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog friends successful
For the time being, the athletes of the dog-friends Bitz were successful in a Rally-Otehce tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his female Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it with 87 points in the 12.
With her Woody in class 1, Susi Höpp presented herself with the critical views of the power judge.
Parents of a teenage from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a upright mat that was behind the gallery in the school hall.
The sheriff of Lowndes County's investigation officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but this is what the 17-year-old family is all about.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed he died the way the sheriff made it.
"They believe that it is without any logic, contrary to the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.
Rather, they were convinced that the truth was covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Her son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
That's what Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson had died from the consequences of "positives-related suffocation."
A second autopsy, however, had a different cause of death, said Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnson, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in the south of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should release all the surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The teenage parents said they hoped that the video records would contain evidence of how he died.
CDC publishes allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines on how to deal with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such directives that the US government has issued, as the number of school children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock - the car injection of the EpiPen brand is the most frequently used - in order to be able to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pushing my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue is tingling."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "sex indefinite"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unclear genitals.
Neonates are no longer assigned to male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare a gender for such children, but can indicate "indefinite" or "unspecified" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions about the procedures for sexual assignment in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person said years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of the 2,000 children is born every year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersexual group, a group that is subject to the diagnosis of "sex differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or uncommonly developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most of the experts in the US are advised to use the best available information on sex allocation if a provision is not possible, and not to wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before, if at all, you decide to do an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
One could do a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret that people are homosexual.
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is not only male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender persons face in the professional life, as well as of the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In the meantime, in Australia and Nepal it is possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or "third sex."
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first "gender-free" person in the world after a court had granted the life-long maintenance of an "undefined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, such a news message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, on the grounds: "If the world is dragged into a new state, where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told the baby zone that it would be better for babies to be assigned a gender at birth.
"The parent's existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your own child," she said the parent's website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodite, after the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, medicine considered the gender to be something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical basis of an operation is questioned, as it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they have assigned.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a" psychiatric emergency, "" said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with non-clear genitals is based on Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be formable.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental attacks - as the parents raise a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child, and shaped whether a person considered himself male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John / Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the child during a pampered circumcision, to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he returned to the male family and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public, who are "not happy with the result."
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana author born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were removed surgically shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was to be given a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical files.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born - and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he moved back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him barren.
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, the managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatisation."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign" unspecified "to the child," she said.
We are afraid that this will favour intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But yet we do not know how the law will have an impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law, because "it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and who supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorised" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and she is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
She is barren, but hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate.
"The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things and so gives them time before they write "male" or "female."
In this way, everything is fine - you raise the child and you love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy your parents' happiness.
And you don't have to hurry to do an operation that can't be undone.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that the parents are driving around because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
In the end, the child decides about the gender that is better suited to him - and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown hurt girl by shot from car
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in the event of a fire from a car.
The perpetrators probably fired a group of children on Thursday night in Genghin with an air-pressure weapon.
That's what the police in Castle told you.
The girl was easily injured on the left Wade.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
They then drove away.
The police were investigating, it was called on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to be employed children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and removed the egg leftovers immediately, no material damage would have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were also lit in the city area, but here too no damage was caused.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his razor-dazzles were removed.
However, until the police arrived, the man found his razor-bladders in the immediate vicinity of all of them, so the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with a Future Perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern that at age the many steps to the house and in the apartment can no longer be overcome, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the middle-fifty has had to know on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Only recently a book of her appeared on the subject 'Happy living in old age - which form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible at all at old age ', she begins to tell.
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most of them keep it out as long as they can.
Only the others are always getting old, 'she says, grumbling.
It's only when the pressure of suffering is really great that you think about it.
'Then it can be too late, too, 'says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 housing models for a self-determined living in the age.
'But what kind of housing you choose is always an individual decision, 'she explains.
There was no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the old age pension in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you will also be united in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives to be considered.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
When you're old, everyone's got their ticks and shit.
'For me, such a condo would be nothing, 'she means with a wink of eyes.
Not like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At old age, you just need your retreat rooms too, 'says Ries.
However, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior community can still work.
But this had to be different than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest, 'she believes.
With this opinion, at least in the capital of the country, it is not alone.
"Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as they can," is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital.
Your service advises people around the topic 'getting older'.
Therefore, especially the elderly would often take on inconvenience and restrictions only in order to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Foundation's product test.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends to all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate conversion of their home or their home, first of all to inform themselves thoroughly and not to entrust the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect will clarify.
But it is not always possible to redesign the existing apartment according to age and thus to make it accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
It is possible to install a stairway inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the door of the apartment, but the much greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more grumbling than in front of the spider at her home door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its position on the former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He was also accused of having passed on unlawfully secret information.
Therefore, he had to face a criminal case in the US, said the spokesperson of the US State Department, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even the recent statements of Snowden would not change that.
The German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had previously called on the United States, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that the statements of a Member of Parliament and not the statements of a German member of the government in the case of Ströbele were the statements of a Member of the European Parliament.
In principle, Edward Snowden is ready to talk to German authorities.
First of all, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee who was wanted by the USA in a non-addressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
The text of the letter is as follows after a translation by Ströbele:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name was Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously a contract or a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my work in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of my government, which led me to act on a moral basis.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent hustle that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high-level officials - including the United States - have considered the revelations to be a public service to a system of universal surveillance that is not accountable to anyone.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming more and more clear, and at the same time the risks taken into account have been clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been shown to be positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of faith and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will adopt this imprecise attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to take an appropriate and legal part in the responsible information of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation has been resolved and thank you for your efforts to respect the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in the garden street to a private person.
The local council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, like to heat up, to look for the garden and to clear the walk.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the bar at 7.30 pm, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammerricher musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first music hock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, said the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book, and on Thursday night she reported that the president's top advisers had "held extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's dwindling hope for re-election would be better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political correspondent of the Times, the book is a thorough reflection of the history of the campaign's and the White House's efforts, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values of the exchange of former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers - including Daley, former head of the campaign Obama, Jim Messina, and the former White House's senior advisor, David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of the efforts to exchange Biden despite their "close, personal relationship," before they finally decided against such a move after the data showed that the candidate Clinton "would not significantly improve the chances of Obama."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to be considered, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigation as "given care," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train would pay off in terms of the ballot boxes.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said he did not believe that the President was "aware of the possible change," the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probation had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama had no knowledge of the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possibly," said Martin.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Has e-mail been technically implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to the traditional mail?
In the design of the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not pay attention to creating a stable foundation for a sound-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a traditional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni," are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, the Anna email program or browser will send the mail to the mail server of their service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are conventional e-mails being read through the network?
Most emails are read several times by software robots on the way.
In the case of the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another job?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trip, Google can include appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability that unauthorized persons will read an email is very low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal outbreak actions.
Is it possible to protect emails against reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical effort it is also possible to mask the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to see who has communicated with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to an August 2013 investigation by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly private post office subjects.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had last fallen, Google's GMail was able to increase significantly.
Mother in the forest is buried and pension is collected
When his old mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
In order to continue to collect pension and care, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigation.
He first covered up the death of the 89-year-olds and then spent more than a year and a half in the money.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
According to this, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: at that time it was noted that the mother in need of care was no longer required for any medicine.
The referee told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this was a strange thing to the officials, they continued to identify.
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old had finally granted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an obduction did not show any evidence of a capital crime.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the dark - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a bright treat.
The idea came to him after reading a research work on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream is responding to the heat in the mouth and light - the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value increases and the ice shines.
We've been testing it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to put it on the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's delicious for that.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in itself impossible because of the light break caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish made by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball-Verbandsliga after six days of playing.
From now on, the team of Ingo Ehlers will be at the Derby in the morning against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope that we will finally have our head free," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
At last, with the exception of the long-term injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete cadres at his disposal.
Daverden, too, is like us on tempo.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
However, first and foremost, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left anything but a certain impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite, because in the Derby, everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to go back to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
The A-Jugend Joost Windßuss, who is active with a double-game right in the A-Jugend-Bundesliga HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, you should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more of a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute candy from my apartment, and I do not think I will do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep for Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the last cry is the most attractive, inanimating objects.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We disguised our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on their pets' costumes, says the NRF.
It's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we're not pitiful.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce, who go through the neighborhood with the saying "sweet or sour."
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let's not pretend - eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it's haunted.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is in a real prison by the way), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spooks in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, America Haunts says, and that includes the wonderful photos that you're peeing in your pants on, and then you put the friends on Facebook, where you're not going to get rid of them, and then the guy you're looking at leaves a comment like "nice face expression."
But let's get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a Pumpkin Lampire is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we did from the beginning.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front garden, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something pretty out of their 921-kilo pumpkin.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechten: Lifetime forces are in the field of charted body
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmbrechts on the late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire during the night for Friday.
The rescue forces have a charred body out of the house.
In a fire in Helmbrechts, rescue forces found a charred body in a three-family house.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday night it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames already hit out of a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest national church has launched an offensive to promote the Pastor's profession.
The background is a possible lack of priests: The Evangelical-Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030.
For today's young people, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day-to-day process itself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the National Church has commissioned a pastor on a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, less and less young people choose to study theology after the abitur.
Burfien brings this back to the process of deciphering: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession was characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastoral agents.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
There is no doubt that more is being paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This is in line with the young people of today, who are not only concerned with career, but with a meaningful work.
According to the National Church, which includes three-quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theological study start their vicariate.
In the future, it could be difficult to occupy jobs in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland.
Burfien wants to organize, among other things, study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a wide range of training.
You can even become the President of the Federal Republic.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free-call system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support of Bowler-Works-mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the strapazas and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge as well as the option to take part in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire department called to rescue a dog who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock ledge in a quarry
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a small traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her bad location.
Firemen sank off on the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The fire department managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stuck on a 15-metre-high lead in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry of Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby back to the reception and to thank the fire-fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately looked for her missing bitch and published a call for help in social networks when she had escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 14: 15 on Wednesday a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station hastened to the place and was sewed off for the rescue of Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said, "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue - she was like stiff-frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, the technical rescue team's specialist, said, "Ruby was very lucky."
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Watching the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in the arms.
The veterinarian said that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid she would fall, but she stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits The Hard" from 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with the altrocker, and that "he hit me when I was 18."
She added, "It's been a long time, and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added, "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" ended up at number one this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scottish the choice
A new day, a new history of terror to independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrianswalls.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal referred to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but this was not, as expected, in the headlines.
No one has mentioned that the EU Member States often have to face their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what the Scots really want.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in the years that it is already like a fossil: for the first time I have heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipe?
Why trade the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the major post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
All over the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party was able to get almost five million votes for Germany in the September election and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket in which the national economy is forced by the holding of the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters - and German politicians would like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public expenditure - spurred by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current budget and monetary problems.
As a result of the "green" energy directives, which have been adopted by Brussels, a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry is paying double the price of electricity and four times the price of gas in comparison with the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage-fixing in the world does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is coming up, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle for keeping Germany in check and raising Paris to an eye level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has put Europe on its own economic policy, with which the affected French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive by-election, thus referring the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right-hand spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and this is very possible - then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too far future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more of a "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may be holding on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone.
Where's Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I believe that Scotland could go very well in a more relaxed European network, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and keeping our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - and is noteworthy - the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that the Labour Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dir coalition had to be responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose an independence now, only to have a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age-mates, as studies show.
Physical changes do not yet directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows breasts and sham hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz said that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - usually this is not a sign that puberty is now coming up quickly," Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, sham and armpit hair, and body odour, are shown earlier in girls.
However, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarchs (the occurrence of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to reach the menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "premature" if breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
In case of faster progress, tests by an endicronologist may be indicated in order to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay early menstruation and to defend another episode: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their age-mates."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how to handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter got her days when she was ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys come into puberty like girls used to.
Kaplowitz is of the opinion that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which is a link between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age-mates.
There are different explanations for this.
Global, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: Although boys have been growing face and shame hair before, the trend towards a full-scale past puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is common even in babies and small children.
"We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician as they should talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders about the width of the seat
There has been a discussion between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-distance flights, which indicates the tone of a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seating width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class - not always the ones that airlines are most interested in, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus called for a industry standard, which requires a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US archrival Boeing says that this should be the decision of the airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is equipped - in particular whether there are series of nine or ten seats - is crucial for the stated economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" is 406 people with seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transported 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often use advertising in the trade press to spread the technical details.
Now, in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to make the race, Airbus appeals directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed the lenders a picture of three people sitting in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-range flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props," says Airbus sales leader John Leahy.
In the face of changing food habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male average Mexican between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to the data of the US Ministry of Health.
According to US health statistics, the range of the average male medicine in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival is holding on to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increase the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the figures of Airbus to the seating dimensions and says that it is not at the manufacturer's discretion to decide how airlines can balance the air fares with the facility.
The company also explains, according to studies, the experience in the plane depends on more than the seating width.
"It really is a matter of giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains the cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, the issue is more elbow-free, but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can have an impact on sales.
The debate is about a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the discussion about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boing's results depend in part on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased unit costs are still lower than those currently used in 10-seat machines per row.
"Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s say that many passengers have opted for the closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin facilities, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-wide-traveling jet-sellers even carry tape dimensions to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of increasing the adaptability of the cabins and offering wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be puzzled but could be distracted from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the fun of smoking the way out
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human testing, further attempts are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination had taken a "time-out," the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translative Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if he was quite sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they are no longer enjoying it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to put off the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
The former minister of the laboratory party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state's corruption authority.
The former NSW Minister denies that he has changed the rules on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three land in state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without a call for tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is found that Tripodi had known of Obeid's hidden interest in the land after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole had declared on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for the lease contracts.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the Circular Quay companies, which received $2.5 million a year from the Obeids, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken out in favour of public tenders.
However, he refused to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a redesign of the government's lease rules.
One of the telephone records submitted to ICAC in August and September 2007 showed talks between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the issue discussed in these telephone talks the preparation of commercial lease arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," replied Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked Thursday night a target in the Syrian port of Latakia, confirmed a leading government officer to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on rocket supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to "authenticity test"
The government is thinking about a "authenticity test" for foreign workers with 457 visas in the framework of extended measures.
If the test was introduced, it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the laboratory party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers, because they could be considered an insult by the neighbours of Australia.
"Sound statements such as" foreigners should get in the back "and" Australia first set up "are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some in the region were to take an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a discussion includes 12 measures that were once thought of by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, and the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personal to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker probably died of a heart attack after having arrived on the Christmas island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been taken care of since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The UK Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England be implemented as early as the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
The Scottish Minister for Transport, Keith Brown, said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving on with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unambiguously" support the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail line in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British Ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode."
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a lot of work, but do not have any immediate plans to change their rules.
The air navigation service authority, CASA, also stated that the announcement would be looked at, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"At present, the CASA has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft," has been said.
The subject is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions provided by cabin staff.
Virgin has already had talks with the CASA about the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and has said that one is open to change, but these must be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas said that one will remain with the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices must not be used when starting and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies, depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio interference from mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer training.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any level," the FAA announced.
In rare cases in case of poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to shut down the devices during landing.
The group also recommended that, when starting and landing, heavier devices be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments above the seats.
In front of the area derby against Schalke, the BVB-trailers with a light tracetas had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced that it would have serious consequences.
The Ultras reacted with a silence before the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart on Friday - at first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustics that offered to the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Most of them were the guest fans with their songs.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, was at first exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battle calls.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common fire, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the gallery, a large flag with the inscription "Section of Stadion Prohibition" was blazing alone.
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place did short-term cheers burn.
When his team members followed, there were loud singing and whining scarves - but not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
The fact that Stadion spokesman Norbert Dickel once again counted the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klop - did not make for a public mood.
Only five minutes before the riot the Capo climbed his pedestal - and the tension, which until then was almost tangible with hands, unloaded in a loud cry, when diapers asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium as usual.
The last one was the South Tribune as always - and finally here was the loudest place in the stadium again as usual.
And at the latest, when the loud call "Derbysieger stands up" came with a whistle from the South Tribune, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before the station at Schalke 04, some of the BVB-trailers who had been with them had fired light tracers into the audience and into the square - and almost met the goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was rattled late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top of the Dormunder Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from playing a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden this," he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown different ways of punishment - until Tuesday they have now time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke said, the BVB would set a penalty by the end of next week.
"This is going to be a big deal," said Watzke.
One may be curious how the reactions on the South Tribune then fail.
Pawns booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawnshop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, and all my money is in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although every month she deserves 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of South-East Asia - where household debt is increasing - is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, has become the third pawnhouse listed on the Sinapurian stock exchange this week.
The pairing of jewelry is not only a fast way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawns in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
Pawns, however, offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of the creditworthiness or income evidence, which is why loans are faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawns, after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a looser fiscal policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium income are looking for pawns to compensate for the difference in the stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency called Standard & Poor's growing budgetary debt, mainly through rising mortgages, a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, an increase of 60% still in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has just come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing deterioration in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in view of increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
In the past two years, the historical high levels of gold prices have increased the trend towards the pairing of personal objects, as people take the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged objects are gold in the 200 pawns of the city state.
People say to themselves, "The gold price looks good, let's pawn Grand Mother's gold chain and bring it back next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pawn business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders were in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explained that pawns would not only be more favourable than other lenders, but also not directly increased the debt.
"Customers do not borrow items they already own, and the liquid of personal valuables does not increase household debt," she explains.
The pawn-lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
And not all people who use pawnshop are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We have customers from every social shift.
"These include wealthy people who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service uncover Edward Snowden has in principle an interest in helping Germany to enlighten the increasingly explosive NSA scouts.
According to the Green House member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence staff would testify to a German prosecutor's office or to a committee of inquiry.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama."
Rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has set up an emergency rescue package that we believe is addressing the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency assistance for election services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic and grey star treatments, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day-to-day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-home care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic health data collection system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of which the hospital staff concerned have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course."
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state's public health system off the list of care," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these election services will largely make up for the recent cuts.
But the health-policy spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is of the opinion that today's announcement is only a "paving solution."
"We are in a position today because the government of the laboratory has withdrawn 430 million dollars from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government is pulling almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth is putting 300 million in and then pretending to be good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niclux 'adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also more difficult food than necessary.
The action played in France in the 1760s tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another's erotic fascination.
The film never slips off in a lustful or sensational mood - and that is the problem.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, so a monitoring group
Syria had destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and grid gas munitions, said the global chemical weapons surveillance group on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious clashes near one of the sites where the suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, which the Damascus-based organization established in The Hague had set up to destroy all facilities for the production of chemical weapons or to make "inoperable," including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all the chemical weapons of Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, from which experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, as the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory reported.
The activist group, which is following the number of dead over a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, that 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have connections with al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underscores the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed to, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites specified by Damascus.
The inspectors said it was not possible to visit two bodies because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "abandoned and that the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been moved to other mentioned facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw my hat to the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the monitoring organisation in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the main Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and their security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong, a division of Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he said.
Anger over judgment for bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died in 2002 in the Bali bombing, were angry at the verdict of the last of the instigators to be brought to justice, as they considered that Umar Patek should be shot on the ground.
Patek, who was on the run for just under ten years as one of the most sought-after people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
With a suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A claim was also made in a number of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had called for a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, is also called a "demolition man."
The decision has raised painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation of Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front of a firing squad," Corteen said to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made to the ground when on October 12, 2002 a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy was supposed to get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To let him live - no, there's no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be in court.
In January 2011, he was taken up in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided evidence that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reestablishing the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The judgment was given before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have mobile calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, listening to music and watching films, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
The speed with which they would be implemented depends on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the air crew and the rules for the storage of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
At present, passengers have to shut down smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not start them again until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing, passengers must turn it off again and not start it again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start, landing and on the rolling field, said the FAA.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded for the use of Wi-Fi at larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional flight crew, welcomed the changes.
"If the new scheme is safely implemented - and we work closely with the airline in this respect - both sides will benefit," said Glading.
We are, to be honest, tired of having to feel like a guard on this subject.
However, Internet connections to the surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or download of data less than three kilometres were still prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the Scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public, because he refused to shut down the device while the plane was parked on the platform.
And heavier devices like laptops must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at start and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, National Transport Security Experts on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem not only because they could cause potential interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission masts," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to study this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become omnipresent.
Some studies mention that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore the device's shutdown.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers after reports of interference of navigation and communication devices by VHF radio carried by passengers had become known, which at that time represented the latest technology.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they do not care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for a few years when the flight height is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally provide much less radio than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give up minimal radiation when you turn over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the supporters of easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com. com.
In 2011, company staff invited a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not find any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he considered the device to be a real fault, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only a few reports of pilots in favour of a malfunction of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
The committee, however, recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the disconnection of the equipment by the passengers in the event of instrument landing under poor visual conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would now be fully equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rereleased by air rescue service of the North Sea drilling island of rescued bird
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released into nature again.
The water rale was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter, where it was mapped up by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: "This water rale was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the drilling island.
He added, "He couldn't fly any more, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the water rale was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders, who are about the UK's business size, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernise and grow while countries in the EU are stagnating.
They hope that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be favored by the government, rather than the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In question, the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster on certain legal issues, from antitrust to product legislation.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as the companies said that the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone - even 40% of large companies agreed, which are traditionally the most European.
Finally, and this is probably the most said, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course to change the agreement, and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
It is a matter of a lot - a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in power relations back to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, as the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which for companies means a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria was one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the CEO of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be seen from the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other suburban countries is expected to start on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate site of Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the financing opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in Europe.
This is what Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out on the 9th day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The view of the transaction volume is shown by the search for German commercial real estate, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period of the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6% and in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds was at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with sexual crimes against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offences related to children before the charges against the child-ward Jonathan Lord of Caringbah were raised in 2011, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA had stated that "the organisation had never had to do with an incident of sexual abuse of children."
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare said, one of the Commission's assistants, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second one.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as being at the forefront of child safety '.
In fact, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had failed "from me to the bottom" in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the children's safety guidelines.
At the beginning of the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations of the safety of children.
The staff said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior Lord, who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior Lord in the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and very unapproachable for most of the time."
The Managing Director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they would not have reported him.
Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organisation had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to urge the staff to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations were made was made by the director of the children's services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but this had been "overzealous" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organisation in the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on child sexual abuse, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, review, consultation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would use the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided speaking on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as an envoy to the Quartet of Peacekeepers in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the horse-show experts came to Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was coming.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago took his first steps, and his Shetland Pony Toffee leaped loose through the three rounds and took the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate cap at a brisk angle and led the two-year-old taffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which were far above his age.
And Toffee got the best notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then has been practicing with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field and left the square with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time he took part in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, "The whole audience was like electrified, and they all fired and clapped him."
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
The way he started, it won't be long before he's on the "horse of the year" show, and I'm sure he'll cut off well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee for how well they would have done and presented themselves in the performance ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer - and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes have contributed their part to it, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had called for the release on the front page of a reporter who had been charged with defamation, was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on TV that he had taken bribes to fake reports about a state-owned company.
The new express is now subject to "comprehensive recalculation," said the regulatory authority.
The "verification order" was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigation revealed that the Neue Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that they had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter's license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group had been instructed to complete the recalculation of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant authorities at the New Express and to immediately check the New Express's management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the state news station CCTV.
I did it first of all because I was looking for money and glory.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the Neue Express published an apology on the front page and said that it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on TV.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year, in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with its own railway discovered between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized in it, the authorities said.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the Court's records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are under threat of a ten-year-long prison sentence.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which poses the challenge for drug cartels to bring their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
The actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out on the separation of his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and he still loved himself, emphasized the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to the lexics, the veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it is very different from that in a very significant way.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream-cake, ice-cream, or a strong edam, these sludges are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan leaves away all the consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but with closer consideration the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealand has been living vegan, and in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers eco-leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
In the first place, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maxima of the vegans, which covers the entire consumption behaviour.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered whole new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually, vegan does not represent a renunciation, no asceticism, but it is an enrichment." The assumption that with the food conversion, the choice of options is reduced, Proctor rather returns to the power of habit.
And this is exactly the kind of conditioning that made some of the more well-meant attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And say, "There are no certain tastes to be found in the animal."
It is often the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in another way," the vegan explains.
For a barbecue, for example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste quite a lot.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but this is not just to reduce to animal food," said Proctor.
He had not suffered any health damage until eating disorders, a further widespread assumption.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take foreign cholesterol and I have an increased amount of vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegan.
"My blood levels are good, I get checked a lot," Proctor says.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"As animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the amount of vitamin B12 is high in the meat you buy in the freezer," says Proctor.
There was also the possibility for vegans to use the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
It was not necessary for Proctor to go far away for food procurement.
After all, basic food is everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on the ground.
I just buy something special every once in a while.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but this is what is known as" ordinary "finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knobs you can achieve good, if not in part better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake, Proctor could also make his parents-in-law wonder.
The vegan gives a new spice to the family.
This has a dynamic, when you cook together, it has a new importance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was also being skeptical.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions one must act as a vegan with a sense of fingertip.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want to be enclaved.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as thought - and the vegan does not seem as limited in everyday life as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many doer shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he evades on pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are starting to get ready for it.
"When I started to feed vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealand can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware."
"If there are enough requests, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the combune in Mannheim or the café bird-free.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes are, on the other hand, exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products could be a little difficult at the beginning.
In particular, when one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in peanuts as a source of colour, one quickly seems to leave the courage with respect to ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
It is not only for this reason that Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganisimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried in food as well as cleaning agents.
"You gradually develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to" It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble, "Proctor knows.
The veganism, it is an important moral finger show that hits the consciousness.
Maybe he doesn't quite manage to put away his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
The stock market operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in breath.
The trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other 11 US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns in the stock exchange operator.
It was only on Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for one hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two breakdowns in one week alone.
At first, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent a lot of erroneous purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total share trade in the US came to a halt due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
In addition, in the past year, Facebook's IPO had provided for attention.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of sales and sales orders, later the SEC established the market surveillance and thwarted the company to a record fine of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radler moves 63-year-olds
The accident had occurred, according to the police, when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night, around 10: 00 p.m., was on the left road from the station to the market place with a women's bike.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on the way from a restaurant, the cyclist was not able to slow down in time, according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and pulled a 15-centimeter-long round of place on the head.
A rescue car team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police order Assange to issue a extradition order
The British police today handed over a extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and applied for asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "call to face up" to ask him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply, he would be in danger of being arrested.
Assange is threatened with extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence, after his possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to the extradition at the beginning of the month.
As he feared that Stockholm would deliver it to the US, he had taken refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "sent a 40-year-old man an invitation to stand at a police station at a time we chose," said a speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange is afraid that he will be delivered to the United States from Sweden and charged with possible spying charges after having published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver who was rusted between the legs with 210 km / h and hot drink, receives £1,000 penalty
A driver was charged a penalty of £1,000 because he had been driving up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie confessed guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention.

Howie was also sentenced to pay a cost of £90 and a victim supplement of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally recalculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of the Chancellor of the Treasury, George Osborne, who had imposed a 7% stamp tax in the 2012 budget on apartments that cost over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
The revenue from the Stamp Tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in 2012 / 13 amounted to £708 million, is already in excess of the revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said, "After the increases in the tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to say that high-quality real estate is too low-taxed, despite the effects of the outdated public tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained in terms of buying real estate in London, or preventing owners from selling," he added.
First-class real estate - the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price - in the wealthy London south-west belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London had a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the south-west part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as a Savills investigation.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog's tail-weaving is associated with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tail waved more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans it is well known that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side swinging of their species, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged legs and analysed the behaviour.
We'll probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said, "We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a true version of nature or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw an otherwise expressive dog move the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the weaving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail was mainly left (again from the point of view of the dog who wanders), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, in which movements they should be worried and when not.
He said, "If you have different encounters with other dogs, and if you have a wobble with a tail in one direction rather than a friendly behavior, and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and the right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team of the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was said: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog if their" tail "wanders to the left and not to the right instead of getting restless - just the other way around than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could be due to the fact that in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he said.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined - and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
But since their behavior can be simply recorded, it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow because of the disease Alex Turner
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved a performance to Glasgow after her lead singer has been diagnosed with larynx.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play at the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be moved.
The band's announcement came after she had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with larynx, which is why he can't occur."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on November 20, and the show was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
On 22 February, Pope Francis was first appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer take part in the election of the Pope - that is the case for a group of 120 "eligible cardinals."
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, which was also known as the Consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably have fallen by February.
He said that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as he needs, so that the number of cardinals who have the right to vote will return to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
The Consistory next year was important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, said Valero.
There is a certain number of European and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding possibilities for the reform of the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it was "possible" for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position - this is all very new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places were typically called cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises - so we don't know who he was calling."
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat-back
General Motors is calling back almost 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks built in 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat-back, according to a communication from the US regulatory authority on vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for setting the front seat back.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
"When the vehicle is hit from behind, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so that there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The reclaimed models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The supply of GM trucks began in June and is the main model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative effect on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperate cry of an Obama elector
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made a commendable effort, which had been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book right now.
It's a book I thought would cheer me up during the deceptive second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient's writing and go to bed in the evening, the book will take me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take the breath of talking.
The election became a landslide victory and news speakers held to show the historical importance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had a 82% vote.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening as if you're being ripped out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad warning of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first gave my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the party-political blockade tactics have turned too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after I have defended the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have reached the end of my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are allowed to be heard or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is being punished that reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that states that the White House's efforts to restate the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon government."
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that the government's work could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
In the middle of Romney, he was a confusing and unfinished alternative, and he seemed unable to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope that we had heard of for so long.
But with the fall in Obama's approval values to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become all the more severe through this book.
It gives me the longing for the many promises that have disintegrated into the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to take a serious loss to Clinton in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his staff that they had to come back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We have to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether or not the CO2 and mining taxes will be cut or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she is on holiday," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission, with 53 votes in favour, officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process to make it faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you enter, enter the data into a computer, immediately choose and then have the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can radiate the results if you don't like them?
It's incredible to use pencils these days.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy was an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously."
A public office was about the public service.
"We do not seek any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community in a critical time," he said.
RBS suspended two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, such as two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global administrative investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly increasing.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the world's largest financial market, where US $5.3 billion are changing owners every day.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal around the Libor interbank business is causing.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from the authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation reported that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a previous dealer to the British supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now expected to have been on leave from his current position as European head of the Forex Spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was suspended this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
The Instant Message Group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that it was investigating the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put the dealers in a riot in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said it was almost impossible to manipulate the large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading dealer noted that, despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks "can affect the market even with very low ticket prices."
The message came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she had quit a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he had caused a loss of just under six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and cooperated with the competent authorities.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is contained," said Credit Suisse.
The building fence is painted on the Bechtle property
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss Meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle-Land on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned and extended the footpath, it says in a press release.
The planned cover of the disintegration house in the back of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the area is threatening to slip off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message with the message "We are for it."
However, this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins."
With this she wanted to point to the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the huge project fail one day.
In the discussion with many passers-by before the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city's project will be better for many, although few have the same questions as the BI.
But they start to resign, because the city is continuing to delay these answers, it is said from the BI.
As can be heard, the public statements of the mayor also have an impact.
In the summer of May, the local council had said that he was afraid of going out for the thermal bath if the population were to vote against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow.
Some, therefore, seem almost scared, others feel that they are "a blunt attempt to blackmail the population," the press release of the BI continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the help.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: No Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is a dangerous tendency at the moment that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of Swallow King," he took the two offensive swirlers into protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3: 0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese became an alleged act of action - which, of course, was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A huge misdecision," said Ragnick, who called referee Harkam "completely overwhelmed."
In addition, Harkam would have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German countryman: "I would have behaved in every single situation the same as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the charmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," said the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the success, Ragnick agreed to a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he said.
There's not much to be done.
In particular, the way the team plays is impressive.
I want it to go on like this.
There will hardly be any cadre changes during the winter transfer period.
There's no great reason to change anything.
"Except for a player who wants to leave the club," Ragnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional within the framework of the State's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts took the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the requirement of the Health Act that state states should either extend the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise all state subsidies for Medicaid would be removed is not unconstitutional.
The action against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place to light itself with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian town have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low solar level, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley, is usually in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic 45-metre-high reflectors, a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" Mayor Steinar Bergsland warmed at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some of the people of the valley pulled out the sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety.
So far, in the winter, the sun-hungry had to drive a cable car to a nearby summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million kroner project (about 615 000 euros).
A similar construction has been in the Italian alpine village of Viganella for several years.
Post is barely empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not yet have noticed that the red points for the Sunday emptying are still at different letter boxes of the core city and the districts, but you can read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you can quickly find out that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP says.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Strasse 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Strasse 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is emptied on Sunday is not answered in the answer to the request of the FDP.
The social and youth political spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to look up here.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service, especially in the case of the appointment post.
"In spite of the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, this undertaking is a radical and unreasonable one."
Thomas Bittner, Liberal Group and City Union Chairman, supports his group's colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that here the empties are changed or even deleted."
The post office is a few miles away from the public.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuchloste and Rosengarten have to be emptied on Sundays again," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
It was also true for the core city, especially not mobile citizens, that a letter box with Sunday emptying could also have to be reached on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning to talk to the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the mail did not communicate with Lampertheim.
In Hofheim, however, there was also a Sunday emptying of his knowledge.
After all, your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking fees should rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
This morning the magistrate of the city advises on a presentation of the transport agent Stefan Majer (Green).
As a result, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not intended to increase prices, but to reduce the time interval between parking clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December the city council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea."
The parking possibility immediately before the business was "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers."
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue."
Public transport is also more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions override hosts
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to take part in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Elders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
But soon it became clear that they could not keep up with the rapid actions of the Freudenstädter, even due to age.
With the hard and placed surcharges the patrons were very difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the middle of the network and were not in the position of the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstädter in all matters.
In the light of this repressive and game-determining performance, the third sentence was then slightly ludicrous and merciless to the 3: 0 final (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent in the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which could clearly prevail in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points, especially in the case of ballast-taking; even in the case of passports, the precision was sometimes poor and in some critical game scenes, the overzeal prevented the look for possible point gains.
In this very well-balanced meeting, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Day of care at the small English cottage
A group of dedicated participants met at the small Englishhütte in Ibach for the fifth day of care in the follow-up to the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley in the area of the hut should be cut out on that day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to the Emperor, described this area as the brilliance of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for beautiful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set an example in nature itself.
At the same time, the tourism aspect could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Protection of the Government of Freiburg following the welcome by the Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the long-term vision is to maintain the now strongly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Some species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free links to the maintenance of the species.
Tribukait said that she would not fail to break a spear for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure does not only fit in seamlessly in this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various comments, the department leaders Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the forest tug is ready to be called.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The aim was to have a clear view at the point of view.
Löffingen: Head still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baar town of Löffingen, with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, child, youth and elderly policy, as well as its own city works can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet been registered.
As the only candidate to succeed the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for the age, the 46-year-old bank businessman and business manager Dieter Köppler from Löffingen has so far been established.
The deadline for applications is Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which has thousands of previous Nortel patents, on Thursday imposed an avalanche of claims for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was oversold by Nortel at the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concerned technology that conforms search terms to relevant advertising on the Internet, according to the complaint, which thus hit the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being oversold by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library on patents.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patent in the auction, Google has violated and continues to do so," says the complaint.
Rockstar claims a high level of damages from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt sworn first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be sworn in, and thus the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months before.
With his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, who had its seat on the Nile and had an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who had been strongly targeted since its foundation 84 years ago as a forbidden organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guards the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential prelude of the Mubarak period, traffic was only stopped for a short time so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to finish the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he took the oath of office.
He later went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel, which played the national anthem, to which he listened in honour.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the largest auditorium of the University with chors of "The Army and the People are One Hand."
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a high-rise of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi took a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers which the military council had taken over from the head of state who had been out of office.
But by taking the official oath before the court, and not before Parliament as usual, he has bowed to the will of the military, which points out that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek ensures two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday night it is called "Pump this party," and tomorrow Saturday evening we will continue with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers fell from ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell off a ladder and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor at the outside facade of a guest house.
When he got on the ladder, which was lured to the roof, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the state hospital in Salzburg with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6."
Rapist in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the offender was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died of the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused horror throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but he denied to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially come from several offenders, but released two suspects because the evidence was not enough against them.
The prosecution also stressed during the proceedings that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, rape is already almost part of the daily life: there are about 64 000 sexual violence ads every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has much more population than South Africa (50 million).
The police and women's associations in South Africa, however, estimate the dark number of sexual violence 10-25 times.
Jumbo visits the black forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7-star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pigeons, Turbomast is not a good condition.
So can ham you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Uli explains the operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham," as Jumbo announces the black forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening at fast bites seen in Waldshut
"This is where I am being worked with huge quantities," the TV-makers, black forests, are astonished as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat, color: Uli explains what the quality is about.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV with a level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited to see you guys do what happens to Roberto Blanco," said Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the disassembly of the clubs continues to be manual work.
For: Black forest ham is traditionally found without bone in the shelf.
The secret of the chew is the mixture of spices and salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo optically of a "submarine."
The trick: Tannenzweige here in the smoke make for the special taste of the black forest chow.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
"It's really good," says the TV star.
This will allow all those involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were a part of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record income from travelers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now assumes an adjusted annual profit before taxes of between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current targets are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre gained eight percent in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year, and some of them are on a good track towards record annual income before interest and taxes," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our strongest sources of results.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which was a slightly weaker market for business travel.
It was also well-done for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less on this.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, and a profit for the third year in a row is expected for the whole year.
The shares of Flight Centre increased by 3 cents yesterday to $38,20.
Schools are encouraged to focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The test also includes "unseen texts" in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisor, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new funding system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that "there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and more stringent."
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools - 116 hours per year or three hours per school year - than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule of hours, it is said from coalition circles that the comprehensive mathematics examination - combined with a stronger weight of the subject in rankings - will probably encourage schools to take more hours.
The curriculum will pay more attention to "problems of the right life," including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colour rashes will be presented at the roundabout performance show in the Bürgerhaus this weekend.
The evaluations were already made on Thursday
The local club W514 is once again hosting this large exhibition.
The breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prizewinners made the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
The visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3: 30 pm, which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a Tombola with a stately material price and to a delicious cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To hell with hell - theological considerations on today's handling of the last things."
= = References = = = = External links = =
The Ecumenical Conference Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant communities of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Gruppenamt Bodensee.
In the forum, Johanna Rahner wants to examine the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had put it on those images of heaven and hell "which still shape our ideas," the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of perfection is rather characterized by a certain embarrassment or even a lack of speech.
"The greater hope has been driven out by the religious criticism of Christians," says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation signs seem to have lost us."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death."
The question is related to the desire "that dreams of everything being good in the end."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Wilhelms in Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleine Heuberg confirm their commitment to the faith during the Confirmation
In two services, 101 15 and 16-year-old young people of the pastoral unit Am Kleine Heuberg have been protected.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the sacrament of the Firmship, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of many members of the community, the Firmlings had prepared for the great feast day.
In various projects they met various tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the Youth Day in Lower Power.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastically participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round course over the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee tells us.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 km and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous Jedermann cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of the German Championships.
These two were able to move away from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.

With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare, who made it to the top of the winning staircase.
In number two and three, Anne Adel came from Lake Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to more than 70 years in the oldest starters.
In the main race there were even more absolute top athletes at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to get away from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professional of the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl was a 12-hour world champion with a team mate.
This year he became the European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls his own two German championship titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 meters of altitude, an eyelash hit final came in the finish in front of the three-lake hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Only one second behind it, the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann were the third in the overall classification.
In the women's race, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
In the second place, Areane Blersch from Bünwangen secured himself from Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance in remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people

Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013."
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to be the "CNN Hero of the Year."
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and went to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then there was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma to affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years with his father in crowded hospitals and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5: 00 in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is for a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most of the comrades could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of the country's health expenditure are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which is travelling on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people forced himself into small buses and with the cordless medical equipment on the roof, drive over unfixed terrain into the villages that need help.
It's not always going smoothly.
They had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.
But when they arrive, they will be received like heroes: a feast, a singing and a dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bwelle - with its wide smile and its boundless energy - is happy to be present at the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will start the examination of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village - and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and the disinfectant equipment is fed by the group's generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It's a strenuous pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group - a mixture of Cambodian doctors and foreign medical students - carried out 700 free operations last year, and knows that with its work it creates a huge difference for the people it helps.
One man said that the free operation of a colon that he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he financed 60% of his non-profit activities, said Bwelle; the rest came from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and works voluntarily in Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations where we help to dab blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring with them often donated medical material.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, the transport and the instruction.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise that he has given to his father gives him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent master of the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea," is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier, the acting art.
No one can blame the old man Santiago for fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man who the fishing boy Manolo is talking about.
If Santiago is tired of life, bent on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his strength of will.
Janson is on stage on long distances as a solo actor.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene into the light: the cabin of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her beautiful voice the feeling of Cuba's life.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
A drainage channel from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne on a length of about 120 metres.
If you visit Cologne, you will not pass the cathedral.
The two towers rise to the sky and make it the second-highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers are aware that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourisme directly at the Dom.
The tour starts unspectacular: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and so the remains of the old city walls only stopped what was not too big.
Most of the users of the car park now also run past the Roman remains and only turn off their car.
But those who look more closely, discover in the park deck D2 an archaeological site separated by metal bars.
There are about five meters high ruins of hand-made stones.
"The remains of the Roman city wall, built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the light of day, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15-metre deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately hardly perceived.
The next station of the tour is the Preitorium, and here the participants get back down into the depth.
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
What CAA means is a visitor.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agripinensium, "which means in good German as" City of Roman Law and City of Agripineser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult. "
And the preitorium is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer canal, which is preserved here on about 120 meters long.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
There's a surprise for Schulze.
After he has taken the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washing.
In the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe is part of an archaeological zone in the town hall square, for which the construction work is to begin shortly.
However, a few years will pass before the completion.
leg almost chopped off: reedition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is rerolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous assault and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the start.
They were said to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the Bandidos.
In June 2009, the prosecution accused them of stabbing and hitting three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have been part of the competing group of Hells Angel.
One is said to have been a high-level member from Berlin.
Apparently, it was preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about field fights and a power demonstration.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first case in early 2012.
A courtman said at the time that it was not possible to prove that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had been wearing masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof lifted the judgment after the revision of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for re-trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open court for another offence.
At the start, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the operations on the night of the day.
As a witness, the then-investigating Commissioner was invited.
The focus was on phone calls from the defendants and other people who had been listening to the police.
It is difficult that in court, Rocker almost always adhere to a law of her own - and not testify.
The same applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last proceedings.
The process is scheduled for 11 further days of negotiations.
The Discard Society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the passenger and back seat the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or champagne may be responsible for that!
What's closer than getting chilly to the next drive-in to have a little something?
I admit, I like to be with you when you get to fast food at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers are noticeable.
Because what must be missing from you that with a steady regularity you throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
In particular, on the weekends, discarded paper bags are located on street edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It's not just that the paper is spilling the landscape.
Bags have also already covered up traffic facilities such as control planks and have caused accidents.
But it doesn't think about it, it probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
When you are on the road more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know how a back-bench can look like after the night: clothes, bottles and other garbage are coming.
There would be no more or less a few bags - as opposed to the road where no one wants to trample on the remains of others' food.
I already see the day when the city and the community are getting too stupid to move away - and the fast food chains have to demand for their bags of pledge.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
After serious criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday on his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received a letter of notice from their insurer, the Republicans have accused the President of deceiving the American public in the last few days.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than expected.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was little surprising that the five percent of the population who have made an insurance policy had to look at a different tariff, as their contract did not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans very directly: they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing in front of the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an imposed Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken up after a dispute with the Republican Member Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to take part in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive a state-funded insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wanted to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air force base
An American government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, said on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air-force base in the Syrian Latakia one day before.
The aim was "missiles and related equipment," which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot at the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis held responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Neva-type defense missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles were seen, according to Channel 2 having a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads of up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official, saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports."
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah earlier, partly successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" to which a military response would follow.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, states that the US espionage has "gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated a softening of the US's defensive attitude towards its monitoring programmes by saying that in certain cases the espionage had "gone unreasonably far."
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for the fact that they had been switched to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the NSA's espionage activities.
The leaked information has led the US government to a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a video-broadcast speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that have actually been done by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was still due to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to the 11 September."
He was the first high-level member of the US government to admit that the US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone too far."
The President is determined to make it clear and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its monitoring.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is committed to killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happened?
We have actually prevented aircraft falls, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have experienced in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US in the anti-terror efforts, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats of no longer participating in anti-terror organisations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board with a view to our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and is the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their annoyance about the NSA programmes.
The media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service this week said that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides.
In all this turmoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the mission of the Congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the type of spy programmes they have been using for years.
"While we can change our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," Murphy said.
In the meantime, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is blaming for a mission by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he's only been able to do it individually.
"We will decide on his commitment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeeper with six hits.
Because the Mainzer already have to renounce the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket because she had wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after she had told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later on, however, a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed that she had made up the story.
Until the court trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phuket, instead of a adult woman prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has turned to the State Department in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
The whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very worried, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is free for a deposit of 50,000 baht.
In the meantime, she is in the holiday resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its affected tourist image, and therefore it will be acquitted.
