Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo for 26 hours, Norway, to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he will receive the diploma and the medal and a check of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The White House's head will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the North-West metropolis and will be busy all the time.
He first visited the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five members of the Committee who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The couple of presidents then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit then reached its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He is the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be talking about the Afghanistan war when the prize is taken over.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He increased the war effort a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which no one forgets from his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme then provides for a banquet with the President and his wife, in which the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the price.
He led, for example, that he had the feeling that he did not deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all those who want the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was for him "an invitation to action."
Protectors of nature are accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the civil society "Natursgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for blackmail.
In several cases, in the past year, he filed appeals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals, he demanded money from the investors in his favour, said the Leitmeritz police spokesperson, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz nature conservation community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison, and he's under threat of a prison sentence of up to three years.
The Sortier waste containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find the Sortier dumpster again on a step and step.
And in Brno?
There you have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I do not want to say that the separation of waste in Brno would not work at all.
However, it seems to me that the Council of Ministers is insufficiently concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we, as citizens, are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics here in the sorting containers, but mainly because of the number of waste tons for such waste.
Have they tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket at any time in the center?
It's just art, it takes time and strong nerves in front of everything.
The only place I have found by chance so far is the Moravian Square opposite the Risen Gans.
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed to us by his colleagues, but that is far too little for me.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is not a honey licking in other parts.
Therefore, whole rows of my friends do not want to sort the waste at all.
For laziness.
It is too far to them to waste cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles myself after the party.
But on the Konicova street I have seen no colour waste cans in sight.
I was lucky to be in the right place when I was driving a tram.
The garbage almost went over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was also able to confirm my adoption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has removed the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the left-wing party, despite the government's view, gave farmers and officials more money, there is no longer any money in the budget for pensions, health and building savings.
But not for the state debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in the government in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists made the increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, old age pensions or health benefits in addition. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future," says Janota.
Of the loans, more and more interest is paid, and one must pay back the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the state cash is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state-owned enterprise are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those who have now been given more money by the Left Party: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for their children.
For the pensions or the sickness benefit, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people don't have to be afraid, they get that money.
But at the price that the state is even more in debt - the next year, not only will the state treasury be missing 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase ever faster and, together with this, the costs and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
In the next year, five billion will be missing for the expansion of the motorways and railways because of the cash-flow in favour of some electoral groups.
These are mainly the parts of the competition that can no longer be redesigned and possibly reduced.
At the most, which is not free.
This means a delay or a cessation of thirty large buildings, and Europe's money-creation is also at risk, the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, warns.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money in a salomonic way - it attacks the CEZ share dividends, in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from them the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ spent 18 billion on the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay for the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7% of GDP under EU rules.
But this is not the end of the carnival of the upheavals.
Almost three billion have been cut in the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and for crimes or for the costs of court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can manage without this money is not certain.
It's just gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister then has to save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing for the already launched two-million-dollar project "State Bank," which is intended to allow on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case there would be sanctions, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It's enough to just press one key, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
The American company VMware wants to present this opportunity, which focuses on the development of the virtual software for the computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on your phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti suggested by the company VMware in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will be in 2012.
The virtualization of the smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
The company VMware is now working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are due to come to the customer within 2012.
Snowy on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneelose slopes do not only sorgenn the giant mountain residents.
The missing snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud," the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jadura, led.
Those who want the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to their ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer saving and in which the quality of the stay comes second, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think that for a while they will try to sell them, but then they too will have to give in and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, estimated Jandura.
Free beds at all winter dates always also offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year's Day in Giant Mountains, but there are less free places here.
The first fourteen days in February are also well placed and the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
On the other hand, and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou are able to be occupied.
We're about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Day and at Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied by the central parking lot in Janske Lazne, 80% for the New Year's Eve stays.
At the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, on the other hand, half of the beds are still available for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year of January, for which we are currently already occupied by about 60 percent.
A little weaker now is February, but the moment the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly increasing, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a larger gift of snow.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to precipitation, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that a warming will come again, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Replay is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost funny, with what student strife Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, is repeating his predecessor's strategy on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off on the copy paper from the Busch-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the expression "as in Iraq" in the text itself several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward path," without waning.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush idea - to send fresh troop quotas to Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war - as a "irresponsible and disastrous decision in its conclusions."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which is based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible and very successful in that respect, that we are no longer talking at all in the news about Iraq.
The reputation of Bush was not improved, because objectively he left a much more grateful starting situation to his successor than was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military have again asked him to increase the troop quota, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite the subordination habits, strongly criticised the wounding shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated on the general for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has expressed his commitment to another 5,000, even if he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
Most of the problems with the whole Obama strategy are his intention to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the war in the brotherhood of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured and its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their mind every day.
The political institutions, even if they have been formally established correctly, remain only premonitions behind which the patriarchal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the incomprehensiveness of the conditions that further complicate the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
The construction of a "capable state" which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation is also very unrealistic.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy alienated by its popularism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the verge of the explosion.
In believing that the little soldiers who have broken into the war cry about the "early return" here create a miracle can only be a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date of the withdrawal of troops is completely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is coming to an end.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters the way in which the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu-Kusch-Pfalz-Vorland.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians are not effective, the United States is faced with a very serious question as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period when America is going to Obama for the victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But each solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only comfort patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there will be three years to the presidential election, and so there will be enough time for him to reach another strategy if it is to be a total failure.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive a prize in cash this year.
This is what the company has announced, which is responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of the money, but they can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the event of excessive risk.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the efforts to link the Wall Street Premieboni with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made herself the target of criticism, after she had set aside almost $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters agency, the total amount of the premium bonuses during this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure today shown.
The high premium in the banking sector has become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the start of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, the UK reported that it intends to impose a one-time tax on the bankers' bonuses, which exceed £25,000.
Similar steps are also being prepared by France.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm, from the hands of the King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, took over this year's Nobel Prize in the technical categories and for literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, Herta Müller, among them was the German writer of Romanian descent.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosone.
The prize for chemistry was awarded by Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the education of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson have received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman was awarded a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have taken this prize for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and a certificate of the purchase of the money prize.
This is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he has recognised the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the top of the country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, while respecting his policy, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday morning, President Vaclav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government, because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for next year as it was released by the Members' Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the subjects of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, and this also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law now being signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, the left-party proposals on money-making were voted on and the money for public officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers increased.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that it is covering up the budget deficit.
The left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other, have therefore created a sharp domestic political dispute, which is why the question mark on the further work of the Fischer-Beamtenkabinett, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidated the package of austerity measures imposed by the fishing government in the autumn, which, according to their understanding, should end the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but does not have to sign it, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem," which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no longer a good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which could build on a wider consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, stated that the budget was terrible and that the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS position president, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil servant cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
In the editorial, Premier Fischer described similar words as "strong pronouncements."
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was terrible, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, which exceeds 200 billion kroner.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" of the world shows a lot of the country, whose struggle and victories despite some reviews, that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story is about sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman in his life history.
Freeman said that he was asked by the nine-year-old Mandela to present him in the Eastwood film.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama of the "Million Dollar Baby" boxing area, has already been the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which at the end has become a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Allmighty," but only rarely someone who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten," and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak as he
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela united his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to reach agreement on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still have a racial and economic divide after Apartheid.
He believes that he can agree on his people through sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players, who are one of the outsiders worldwide.
After all, the South African team is up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked on it for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The greatest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said, if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that if I shake your hand, I'll take over your energy, it's being transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you're feeling, he said.
It's important for me to be another person.
In the film "François Pienaar," Matt Damon is the captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have outweighed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the character of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the paper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarised his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good story, very well-performed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a rocket
There was a special light effect on Norway of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only yesterday admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was not successful again and the rocket, known as the "Bulava" type, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the nightmare of Russian generality and of the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at the Rocket Test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
In most cases, bulava has not been started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one already writes about "Bulava" as over a "rocket that does not fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights up
This already 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage to the missile occur.
The engine probably exploded at the third level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donsky, who was driving under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch of the submarines.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object was actually the damaged "bulava."
In addition, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has this time kept away from it and claims that it is not possible to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two steps of the missile were not lost and the accident was only affected by the third stage.
In the previous cases the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without error, the management of the Ministry of Defence only considers six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost 50% success therefore fills generality with optimism and is still claimed that the "bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov again presents himself at the age of 51 in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow in the trouble, and probably already in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who has completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will concern only one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, who performed fellow players Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice area, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Gordie Howe, with fifty-one years, played a whole season for Hartford and was able to make 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two gold medals, seven world championships and he also won in Canada Cup and in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also made his NHL debut, where he won the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the trade unions. All overtime will be lifted
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime.
The union announced the willingness to strike on Monday because of often arranged overtime.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be working, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay for the overtime supplement or they can take a discount on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek added.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will be paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided with immediate effect yesterday afternoon on the lifting of all overtime for December, said Vaněk.
The employees of the car factory had until last week been forced to work two more overtime hours almost every day after the eight-hour shift.
As of the signing of the agreement, the willingness of the trade unions to strike will be withdrawn.
Further negotiations between the management of the car factory and the trade unions will be held on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be ready to lift the striker's willingness.
The situation at the car factory was sharpened last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for continuous overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management held that the employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unionists also called for in their Monday-day strike call that the employees who had interrupted production on the previous Wednesday should not be subject to any sanctions.
In the field of overtime, the trade unions call for a minimum of overtime work.
In addition, they are calling for the payment of 5000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The production of the series was started at the company in November last year.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with 'stowed' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as much as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can continue to live and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your dose is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus proliferation also results in the development of resistance viruses that are no longer effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to how to deal with the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances known as metalocarborans are active on the protein responsible for the proliferation of HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new 'improved' compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metal-carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two versatile cages, which consist of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal-atom, in this case cobalt.
Tasty and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature infection virus particles.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the virus's proliferation in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease has been tested in the reagent glass, including their persistent (resistant) variants produced by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as for the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants, against which the used medicinal products are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical design, makes the Metalocarborans an interesting link for further research on the development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The fight over budget. ODS started on fishermen, who resists himself
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "cruel" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, in his opinion, should consider its further existence.
The ODS 'statement was described by the Prime Minister as "strong speeches."
It's supposed to be time for the analysis.
The vice-president of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the civil servant cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit or whether he is going to remain in office with the help of the left of Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas has pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, but with left-party amendments of more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for public officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that it is covering up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic was to run with a backlog of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has responded to the government's wish, because the changed budget is only a less bad version of the budget forecast.
Disappointment and senseless
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has talked about his disappointment and a sense of senseless, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to withdraw in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Premier for Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budget's negotiations.
To what extent fishermen are in favour of the further fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had made the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions, or the new laws on services.
Topolanek: The ODS-nominated ministers were not wrong
This is the matter of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy function who are confessing to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide not to fight the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-hand majority that is currently in Parliament."
Then he is supposed to be unable to expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this is going to be the case, I will deal with it, the Minister for Defence, appointed by the civil Democrats, Martin Bartak, said to the journalists in Parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister would explicitly ask the Members of the Citizens' Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not find ourselves as orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party president in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevik of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railways), fewer trains will be used for about the same fare.
The Czech railway will end or limit from 13 December some less-loaded fast and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared with today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer travel rates will not be changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, and the railway uses the pendolino-type trains for this line.
The fast train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections will be reduced from Prague to Letohrad.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but an increase can be expected in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis line are also lifted and to a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis line is reduced.
One of the major changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, and at the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk / Jesenik will run at a time distance of two hours.
With the pendolino, passengers can no longer go to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million increase
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railway will receive a total of four billion kroner in the next year to pay for the so-called liquidity loss. The local trains will provide the districts with a total of eight billion kroner in the next year, and the state will shoot three billion kroner.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local and fast trains, the railway has resigned a ten-year contract, so far the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railway is praising the system, and perhaps that is why it has not been able to increase the price of the large majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made for one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap Internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card the price CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the car, so far it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine millitante arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary students and their teachers.
This is what the agency AFP has mentioned, which originally only informed over 65 abducted people.
All 17 children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 million people were said to have used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostage.
According to the agency AFP, the millionaires belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that called for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was related to the election to the Governor's office, were 30 journalists.
The governor of the South Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, were arrested for suspected participation in the massacre, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday the peace negotiations with the Philippine government have resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be in the American cinema "Invictus: the Unbeaten," which includes part of the life history of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had been reportedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The side-actor of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the film's start of the film, the reactions of critics and the public are also made loud.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup are culmination in South Africa, but at the same time, the media are shaking the world's public with frightening news about the increasing racial hatred and the discrimination of the people on the part of the black-ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are always positive, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
According to his own words, Morgan Freeman is still proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person several times, so that I can receive his energy, as they say, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing we can use this film to get to the personality of Mandela and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin, who is freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, portrays the South African human rights advocate within his first presidential election period.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman is trying to bring together two racial groups and, for years and days, each other, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also playing his role in the South African National Rugby Dress at the World Cup, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested great ovations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may be able to bring people together again into a single people, led the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving, that will only be seen.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical, as in recent interview for LN the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching system near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem district fire department, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened.
The fire department originally wanted to burn the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is erased with a mixture of water - foam and special oils.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer short circuit.
No one was injured, the Havarie did not risk the security operation of the management system according to the firm speaker, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million kroner, the damage will only be measured after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened in the company of Ceps, and mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted in the middle of the spokesperson of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the Trafosstation did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is active in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the control system, the power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and developed 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, which transfer the electrical energy into the distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura is in charge of slander against three CSSD leaders.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today on trial for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The action is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional train transport in some districts.
All regions, however, have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders are attacking us and saying that we are taking out the raisins, and we have only made the offer above the extent to which it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive as the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend us.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journalist.
At the same time, he claimed that he had evidence from all the districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the prosecution to be a continuation of the media show of Jancura, which serves him as a free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that this issue will also make it clear that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public in the case of regional one-way transport and using lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura already reported last week that he had invested several million kroner in advertising, which will point to the negative step of the districts.
He told the radio journalist that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year's Eve.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on the initiative of regional rail transport with the Czech railway and had not issued a tender for the order in a high of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
He was also a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura.
The only threat was if we did not give up the fact that we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, said today to the radio journalist Jancura.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Inventing against pneumococci changes the living from January.
The first is to be free and voluntary for the families.
But the vote is already taking place that the compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The pharmaceutical company already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that the health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of the vaccine.
Those who have already started the vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay for the revaccination themselves.
The first dose must be given between the third and fifth months of the child's life.
A quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci last year.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In general, the experts estimate that the health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner a year on the doses.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all the children's vaccinations.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause central ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections have led to the death of up to 28 children up to 10 years of age in hospitals per year.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
As of January, these are to be paid by the insurance companies and be voluntary.
For example, the head of the Nahlas Civil Association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in doing at least that.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure for pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The president of the specialist society of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnoerova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, one could think about reducing the number of revaccination "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination has been launched as a voluntary one," says Cabrenonova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of the parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first area vaccination paid by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, cautions Cabrneonova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, involves a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be bought by the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them on the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance companies could "take the money out of the health insurance."
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
It's not gonna be easy, says Cabrnoonova.
US artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken into his vehicle with a trailer at the invitation of 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta and another man had used a excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police declaration, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "to enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior denied any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the previous report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "left" an opportunity to show that he meant it seriously by reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor was also under fire to target workers with low and medium income.
His main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap on public pay for 2011.
Social security funds
The trade unions have protested that low-wage earners are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of imminent "problems."
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic recovery.
The increase limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year will affect about 10 million workers.
SETTLEMENT OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORTS
Social security increase by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy's shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small companies rejected
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of government pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £190, while a person with £10,000 per year will be richer by £110.
Ministers said their target of the deficit-cut by 2013 was "difficult decisions," but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be paid by the 5% of the top-earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and expenditure stops outlined would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big figures. They will bring us the deficit-cut and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth - which will influence the level of new debt and the speed of the deficit reduction - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to decline by 4.75% this year - much more than the fall by 3.5%, which was predicted in April - while the debt would be at £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the planned debt of £789 billion over the next six years is untenable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan, as they will pay back and "cynical" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything about what they were going to do," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do so, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be kept from future cuts, unlike the Conservatives' proposals, which see the deficit capping coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and spending stops is used to cover next year's expenditure, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand."
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the notices - such as the above-mentioned inflation adjustment for some disability pensions in the next April - the Chancellor of the Treasury would be exposed to the accusation of the start of the vote, as the money could simply be brought back next year.
Labour is insisting on providing extra assistance when people need it most and on re-examining the situation in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only be put into effect in the medium term.
The well-known Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Chancellor of the Treasury would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his head Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to the audit company Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow pre-budget report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "Arrest of US Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens for the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandshab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it was being investigated to see if these were the same men who were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be of Pakistani origin, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schwich said the agency was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had been interested in the house before and that no charges were filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that "the US must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuses" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report in detail "patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
The official authorities said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the greatest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, said our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protest against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty informed.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to examine the post-election riots and the government's reactions to them, but so Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark into a competition track in Bristol.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that are glittering below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Awards were awarded for the best pieces of art or tricks on the slope.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow is left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a ban on building minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most secularized societies in Europe - and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book in admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely-argued study of a question that the country has shared and occupied over a decade and a half and its effects are still to be seen today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and cooler spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it, "Islamic Free Spaces."
He is a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or a city hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it allowed for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, to be a good Muslim and, on the other, to be a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen asked about are mostly in disagreement with their Salafi counterparts - supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, which is related to Saudi Arabia - who today show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questioned the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of the Church and the state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a more severe treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular republicism.
He is more aware of "the tightening of the value screws" than of a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolate view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts with alarming speed and takes with it life that can not survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Travelling in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the lake, who only fought with the gun flask of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears that were caught as they swam behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have a millionth of the habitat of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became very green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motorsleigh-driving inuit use powerful storm rifles to bring their prey down.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist," offers a clear and disturbing description of the Arctic science and a palpable insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries had the first chance to see the confusion of the package ice.
In the Cold War, undersea boats measured the shifting rate during the sinking.
A useful addition is satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still a lot is achieved by unscared people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater saltwater sales that are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice once passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... this could be us"
Marinefanterists were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington's wreaths
De'Angello Robinson was on a bus for seven hours to put a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marinefanterists who took the trip of Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they took.
In a few months, from wherever we're always being brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, the owner of the funeral wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who take this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreath's Across America (wreaths all over America), which has also extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the graves in the Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, in the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she had taken the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back something to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to help civilians support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as their goal, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organizers said.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held their hands while they carried the fresh pine branches to the grey tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some were crying open, others were praying and families and friends were holding on to each other in the icy air.
Some read out the names carved in stone, while others turned down to small black-and-white cards, which had been put in the wet mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son's grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the burial site of Marine Franconist David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been in a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the US government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the State Department on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternative Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US International Development Authority and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US interest representation in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the accusation of "danger."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, are at risk of being arrested.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy is important for the United States to provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only since this year allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone, they are used to send text messages, because a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press officer of the US interest representation in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information on the arrest.
The arrest and the detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the issue of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba, entitled "New Castro, like Cuba," a reference to the appointment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country who replaced the sick brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives uncover a plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope this case could help to uncover a large-scale network of terrorist recruits who search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after finding them, because one of them had made comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page of YouTube.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed of the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - who continue to be in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - highlights the crucial role of the recruits in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has made it a matter of extreme urgency to place human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruits of the organization act as a doorman who does not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subject to a special test by A Qaeda, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the top-level analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the USA, said that in recent years, terrorist groups have also become much more careful about who they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to bring someone into these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate "action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and asked the negotiators of the Bella Congress Centre of the city to take more bold action in the field of climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates were more likely to be about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, even though a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-supported climate negotiations, thousands of activists were wandering through the city with banners in English, saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says enough."
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travels to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, make her aware of the heart-breaking problems that the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - to give the word and appeal to the world leaders to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way around it anymore.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, in which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, and added that they started as a flare, but then were followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest does not seem to have reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that they are disturbing the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show persistent race air
The math performance certificates were welcome news for the public schools in Washington, D.C. last week.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the schools of the country that produce the highest performance, the evidence shows that the four and eight-graders have made faster progress over the past two years than the cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent range of performance between African-American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average number of white four-graders from Washington, D.C. has increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but their African-American counterparts have only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-graders remained basically the same, it fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
And even though the number of points that children of both groups have reached has increased over this period, the difference with now 58 points has not been reduced.
Some of the district's educational supporters expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already high-performance children.
This suggests that we have increased the overall rating by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equal education in Washington D.C..
I do not jump up and down for a range of two or three points, said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the test points is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we do not spend almost the time and energy we would have to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson-Read-System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and middle school, which have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their same-age classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and life-long experiences from the kindergarten to the sixth class, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to give the best measures to the students who are below the level of emergency, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is studying urban test results.
The conventional cure is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could create political consequences that are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the urban areas so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to close the service gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, in order to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to about 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year for 185 days a year, which he considered to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a vision for the future
The bus reaches Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick-stone-bonnet and the emerald-green lawn.
Graciela's parents have hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-graders of the group who explore Gettysburg, where the class costs $38,690 per year, was more of an awesome visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the Führer announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thinking, when she was told the low professor-to-student relationship of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th to visit the children on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: the question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the USA who do not end high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand there are hundreds of thousands of people who receive college education that is necessary to get into the middle class.
In fact, one of the five of these "second generation" of Hispano-Americans completes college - which is a remarkable achievement, since many of their immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the USA without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's labour force.
Those who study high-performance children say they often have a natural affinity for school and a driving force for success within them.
Many of them also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But guidance programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find a way through the system, then at some point in time a single measure will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a support network from pre-school to high school.
The federal program that Graciela's college tour had funded is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a gear up - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue to run until they have completed high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% went to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil closes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil concluded with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies give the way to Asian and European, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still highlighted by massive coordinated bombardments on Tuesday, and the political instability of the US military's withdrawal probably prevented American oil companies from becoming more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have had close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its partners and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The companies selected for the bid were given bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, which the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US rocket attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda operation planner was killed this week, said representatives of the US against terrorism reported on Friday.
This would be the second fatal attack on a high-level terrorist organisation this autumn, if it were confirmed.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities, were killed by a number of missiles that met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said a government representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by phone.
Local residents suspected of being one of the militants ran to the place and quickly took in everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two US anti-terrorism representatives led to indefinite evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of the Al Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy all over the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the US air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If one takes its central role as given, it also included the planning of attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and put them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American government representative said that Somali had quickly ascended into the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second government representative, but this in no way reduces the risk he presented to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who was killed since September when a similar attack on Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area, and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of the CIA drones' attacks has since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website held by a non-profit organization, decreased from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while at the same time brutally killing suspected informants, reported the site.
Leading UN Envoy in Kabul will resign
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, which would end a stormy term of office, shrouded by claims of widespread corruption in the UN-supported Afghan presidential election.
Eides is taken away when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the army increase, but he also expressed his concern that the US military withdrawal schedule, which is due to begin in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of the Afghan security forces and by sending the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The military force increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign, but only fulfilled an agreement reached in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO-
President. - The next item is the report (Doc.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has, according to UN representatives, started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-based Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eides' position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, charged him in September with favoring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "have certainly caused damage to the mission because there is already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also called for the UN leadership to allow its successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries who are donating to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in able people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I have only been able to hire one person.
This is disastrous and must not go on like this.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not take part in talks about his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day trip through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good choices, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my mind is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, the unpredictability of war."
The Obama government is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average sirano.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected by nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer from the sanctions."
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the European leaders in warning that Iran must expect "credible" consequences if its nuclear programme does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to limit its nuclear programme and would renounce a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has urged this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided about whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran simply left the international community in relation to some of the proposals that it had already agreed at the beginning of October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those once called Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton "oppressive sanctions."
In a New York opinion, the Iranian representation to the United Nations condemned what it called "unsubstantiated and unsubstantiated claims" on Thursday by some security council members on the Iranian air activities and said that they were willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in US plans to reduce the American forces' strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A Change in the Course in the Ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was direct and final: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a head of staff with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has brought about two generations of notorious, disgraced single children, who are lovingly called "little emperors," a population crisis in the country is emerging.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UNO
This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-old and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of the registered population of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning mission, said that couples of childbearing age must have babies to "help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and alleviate the labour shortages of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial provision that the ruling Communist Party has introduced to this day.
Married couples who are in breach of this policy must expect huge fines - up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions - and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had sex-elective abortions, resulting in an unnatural high ratio between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing's Institute of Population Research, said that government representatives have recently even discussed more radical changes, for example, to allow couples to have two children with a partner being a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters who taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for the authorisation.
The city administration has sent out city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that there is an upswing in the applications of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai community of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was also legally allowed.
But, like many Chinese, they have only a small health and life insurance policy of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West wrongly rate one-child policy as a human rights issue, Yang said, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yeah, we're being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wanted a child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want to. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it unblatantly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it turns to be successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of the 20-39 year-olds today grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese Capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, poses huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the room question -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you have to have a resume for the best pre-school."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to have achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group designs emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference - which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations - once again focused on Friday on the publication of a document that will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to bear the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has identified both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a UN working group specifically for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that policy-makers would support.
The process is given great flexibility, said John Coequyt, leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has put together a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the UN's leading climate change representative, Yvo de Boer, called "the big deal."
It shows the ground plan of a possible agreement where the industrial nations would together reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its commitment to provide 3.6 billion US dollars a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
The Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had determined last week.
The US Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that call for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by the industrialised countries.
This train announced that the Obama government has a tougher line with China than the Bush government representative, not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies standing up and taking action, Stern, who also complained that the text would not go far enough, would ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his statement one hour after the statement of the Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or that it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake has been broken down both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is about saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting to bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved more aggressively to bring the countries with a very high greenhouse gas levy to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominance, said Ulate, who is also a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change reported that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty in the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is head of the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "puts political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues had to be resolved before the government leaders arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jaimam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, escaped their aircraft and raced through the Bella Center's corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to set off claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer extent of the meeting -- 13,000 people go to and from the Congress Centre every day, gitar-playing activists are holding night shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think betray and sell, and draft contracts are passed on by hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all important ministers are now here and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km / h fast train redefines the Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5: 13, a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train ride that is a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach the London St. Pancras 225 km / h on its lightning ride from Ashfort, Kent, and will travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then go on board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
It hopes that the new UK service will eventually link to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and will connect the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced and the change from plane to car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the streets.
In theory, the three great parties believe in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds required to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could still be a brake on the British high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will, according to the Times, present the report to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will give him a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which is to connect London with the West Midlands, will pass by urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial, with a margin of five metres.
In the open area the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters of the final distance.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped line that would lead a single high-speed line to the West Midlands.
The line would be divided in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway insider.
After the completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the line, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel the London-Birmingham line in 49 minutes, compared to today's one hour.
The designs would allow trains to drive at a speed of 400 km / h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned to allow 400-metre long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would mean, in turn, that a terminal station in London would be necessary, where 20,000 passengers per hour could be made.
In view of the territorial restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be developed to accommodate the high-speed network.
Bahno experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that this plan should be continued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a crucial point in order to ensure a change from plane to rail, a measure of the rail revolution.
Tax payers pay for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of orangery of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative House member, has charged the taxpayer with thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he was building in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained about the need for house members to live "from lean rations," has raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak-wood specialist shop to his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest rate, a sum of hundreds of pounds a month.
The members of the House of Commons approved the applications at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the richest house members, has a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control post of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he built a winter garden called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
The Committee on Standards and Privileges did not ask Duncan to comment on the increased use of money during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage agreements.
The Committee acquitted him of the breach of the rules last month following an examination of its expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred security for a mortgage of £271,406 (EUR 300,000) from his London house to his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of Parliament.
This week, documents published show that Duncan was reimbursed by March of last year about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase was used to finance the borrowing of £75,000 (€85,000).
The normal strenuous RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that this May Duncan continued to claim its right to £1,250 (EUR 1,400) per month.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him in the film, when he said, after the spending scandal, that members of the parliament would live "from lean rations."
"In essence, if you work for the state, you have to live by lean rations and how to treat S * * * * * * e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I have made a claim to a small part of it, in terms of what is to be.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don't. "
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May for spending when it became clear that he had called for thousands of pounds for his garden before he had settled with the Fees Office that this could "be regarded as an excessive claim."
An activist, as a protest in Duncan's lawn, dug a hole in the form of a pound sign after he had become aware that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and then by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about evading and swinging or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is fully transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer. "
Come all you faithful to admire Brighton's beach cottage Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond," an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1 and visitors were allowed to look at the latest cottage every day from 17: 30 to 18: 30 with free mulled wine and traditional mint pies, pastries filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships," "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël," where the house decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary priest of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize inspiring celebrations.
The idea of the beach cottage Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality. "
Strong mobilization for the climate in Copenhagen and in the world.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police have carried out several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which was to lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the increasing global mobilization for the climate is contributing to the fact that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place a short time after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had broken window windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest policemen have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to you, were arrested in eastern France, in April, mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs," these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has been strongly criticised for the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction," and has stressed that about a hundred of you "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in seat position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators have arrived with buses and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice."
Today we are going on the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological guilt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
European Commissioner José Bové, the form of the globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are in particular danger of warming, has given the start for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
There were hundreds of people in Manila, mostly students who marched in red and hated bandanas in which you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong, or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, there were marches of a few hundred demonstrators to demand a strong approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the 350 network have gathered a few hundred people, in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
In Geneva, some people have gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "prank."
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as self-employed, Tbilisi denounced the "prank."
About 131,000 people were called to take part in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist area that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5: 00 GMT.
The turnout was about 58% a few hours before the local election, according to the Abkhazian election commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the one hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, his press officer, Manana Manjgaladze, has explained.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia that is legally occupied by Russia.
After it had separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, an 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to choose a place in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch is to be seen at the side of the Russian President and the President of the Council, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is in the east of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to the support of Moscow, in particular as regards the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, replied and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract of the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have arrested about 700 people, on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until 18 December receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to enter.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of protesters, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to take in discs, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-unrest police have immediately circled in and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and made clear that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs," these extremely violent groups of splinter who have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were temporarily arrested, a police officer suffered an injury on the chin by a paving stone. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of order were circling in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by train or with their own vehicle from German major cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were European.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, and Africans.
In the morning, almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen after the call of the Friends of the Earth to a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice."
"Today we go on the road to demand that the ecological debt be paid back to the people of the South," said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say to ourselves: we still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that seal, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalisation movement has come closer to environmental protection organisations.
The French MEP of the European Parliament and the critic of globalisation, José Bové, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, have made in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for the solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the "network of 350" demonstrations, especially in Paris, Marseille to the south, Lille to the north, Bordeaux to the west and Lyon to the east.
In Geneva, several people gathered.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are reinforced by the school reform of the Lycéen.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche," the national education minister Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycéen, even if they are not compulsory in the terminals (12th year of school).
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," Mr Chatel confirms.
For the Minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but, in general, a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific," he continued. "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceas."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) are critical of the state project of the abolition of compulsory teaching in history and geography in the Terminale S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticised this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminals programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of education for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which they considered to be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they were subject to a technical aptitude test at the beginning of the year in Master 2 (M2) and an approval examination at the end of the year in which their teaching skills were tested.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year in front of the students as a teacher in the internship.
He also said, "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you can reach more hours before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The Minister finally said that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in the education of the people."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to abolish the school card "by 2012."
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normal Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist said, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each turn to the audience for 15 minutes with film-made contributions.
One would like to do something to reach people and to make them feel like they want to know more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organizers of this day, on the verge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the bassist school.
"Among the experts, about 20 participants were selected, even after their charisma," he explains.
"It is possible to talk about climate warming for hours, but the core objectives can be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who only spoke freely in front of about 50 people with the help of films.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed, in the hope that the listeners can be seen from the fact that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos made by these conferences will be available online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months.
Late payment: angry prison guards, planned actions
The trade unions of the prison officers called on Friday for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budget reasons were paid before the Christmas holidays.
The second union of prison officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the staff who have no service to demonstrate and block on Tuesday morning in front of the prison to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to."
The third union of prison officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons," on which the non-payment of overtime, night supplements, and the Sunday and holiday supplements in December will be a "shameful and unacceptable" market.
The first union of prison officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP / UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The management of the Penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice have said that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them were in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the trade unions of the prison officers, which guarantees that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and to modernise it," the Minister of Justice says in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prison office to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has been caused by a lack of assessment of overtime, is not repeated in the future," said Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore lower, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP / UNSA, for whom the "budgetary constraints" must be met.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces to boycott "all meetings and convocation" up to new instructions.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours of October in December are still not paid, and this also applies to their overtime," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich the staff's money is more than inappropriate," said the CGT-union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UEFA, Jean-François Forget, states.
Obama thinks he's giving Christmas more and more gifts than he's getting himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has announced to the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he is getting himself.
On a special broadcast, which was broadcast on Sunday evening over the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog is of course also getting a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she teases the president.
"So please," he shuddered her and pointed to the first lady's bead chain, "and who gave it to you?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an unforced atmosphere with the well-known TV presenter, whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about the gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-course bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the President.
"Only much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her doll's house.
"I didn't know how to order the furniture in a house, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperates, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people around him the situation is "under control," although RTL confirms that the singer was put into the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was again operated in the hospital of Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, after the American doctors had found "damage due to the operation of a tape disc incident" which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, so his production company in Paris, which added that these damage would have required a new operation.
The singer's production company, however, wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and said that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, only after 48 hours had a little more certainty on the condition of the patient when he opened his eyes, added RTL.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources," that after his first operation in Paris, "no" dränage "was laid.
The rocker had been operated in the international hospital of Parc Monceau for a tape disc incident.
The procedure planned for several days was carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments to RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was sent to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was of the opinion to RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley." However, he assured himself that it was "not necessary to worry" to make the rock musician, as he was "a good fighter."
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, that's not going to happen," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "responded well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained."
Mr Camus also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had not felt any special concern.
However, the concern for the health of the singer had become ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had fallen on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colon cancer surgery," which resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not missed that the singer on stage had a lot of effort to move.
It was only in mid-November that the surrounding persons had to deny a new entry to the hospital.
Euro-2009 / Short track: First place for Bousquet about its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, took on Thursday an international title about his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while one had expected a true record flood.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the gentlemen.
Pity for Bousquet, who wanted to reach the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in swimming, 50m-free-style, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 seconds. In a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater things and in the present case I said that if the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition.
This time the use of the combination has not paid off for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3: 32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3: 34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
"I didn't give it all this time.
I knew I could not win a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job. "
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA: Zola's grave plate estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman grave plate, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the 3rd century after Christ and was always rated with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysus are represented in a sophitic architectural decor, surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still in progress, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most of it so far," says Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
During the search of the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola," which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart."
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras in the direction of Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the president, Manuel Zelaya, to the country, who had fallen, to be no longer compatible, after the coup government had rejected this line as unacceptable.
After a telephone call with President Zelaya that night, it seems that there is a disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the Immigration Authority, the aircraft provided by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelaya, had returned to its place of origin.
The coup government wanted to require M. Zelaya to "abhor" and ask him for political asylum abroad.
However, the president, who was dismayed, refused to do so, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcome, President-in-Office of the Council.
The coup regime "has suffered a further failure by trying to move me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to thank you," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis, which has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and like ten years, here I have my guitar, added the president, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with a few chords.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for guidance to us, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the Putsch Government, had explained to the HRN of Honduran Radio.
I do not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesu channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, he would only be the president of the people of Afghanistan.
On Wednesday, the rumors of a departure from the country, M. Zelaya, had mobilized the members of the president who had moved to the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, and the military there had increased his service.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the people's survey he organised to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he had returned surprisingly on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves these, he is imprisoned for high treason, to which he is accused by the judiciary, the coup government says.
The coup President, Roberto Micheletti, has managed to organise a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
In the course of the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argeninia and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had massively voted against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upswing, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high level, the US trade balance figures showing a recovery of the US shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67% and the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the closing of the market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 was written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from different sectors, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial ruled.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is only focusing on "half-full glasses," so she mocked.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit in October fell by 7.6% to 32.9 billion dollars in September.
In contrast, the analysts had expected an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the case of goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, Christopher Cornell commented on the company research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment in the United States has increased in the last week against all expectations and has now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average of new job seekers over the last four weeks had "fallen to the bottom of the year," stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The obligation market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared with 3.432% on Tuesday night, and the profitability of the bonds to 30 years to 4.492% on the 4.408% on the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of guerrillas in power whistle out "ladies in white"
On Thursday, a few hundreds of partisans, standing in the Cuban power, took the wives of political prisoners who came together in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day, and also thwarted another rally, which led to a good dozen dissidents being temporarily arrested.
In order to get the forty "ladies in Weiss," wives or close political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP confirmed that they were on the open street of the government's partisans under Raul Castro, just when they were on the march to the center of the city to demand the liberation of the political prisoners.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!," the road belongs to the revolutionaries!, "" "There are Fidel and Raul!" the authorized partisans skandered against the dissidents with a raised fist.
The latter were escorted by the civists who had appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "ladies in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the eve of which there were neither injuries nor arrests.
In the Havanner district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also opened up to the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, confirmed an AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents who have been outsourced by the partisans of the government to enter civil vehicles under the use of force.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "ladies in Weiss" have organized an unapproved march for the purpose of the "request for the release of all political prisoners," the number of which, according to the dissidents list, has about 200 people, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda is a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of whom 53 are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" at the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
One of the rarity in itself is that Cuban television received a report on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "control-revolutionary."
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of the disapproval of rights and freedoms, in particular of freedom of expression.
Mad kills eighty-year-old with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A lunatic, armed with two knives, killed an eight-year-old on Friday against late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first data of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, police data according to the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, has, according to a person in charge of the police syndicate Alliance in the hospital, killed the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the '30s, intervened and got hurt.
The first two victims were sent to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life because, according to police sources, he was apparently affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and, according to a police source, she is said to have been hospitalized in the "shock state."
The armed man, who, according to the police, seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, was immediately on the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two other passersby, apparently by chance: a three-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of both heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he had crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a member of the syndicate Alliance of the area of Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passersby, including young people, are said to have tried to tame the madman, according to the witness reports of the AFP.
I saw a guy in the '30s with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They couldn't make it because the guy was well-built, reported Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
On the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of number 61, two city police, including their superior, have tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife marks, so police information.
The event has taken place in one of the main corridors of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by came to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first-aid position and noticed a rattling wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about three-year-old, was injured by cut wounds.
State police forces have finally arrested the man who did not carry any ID documents.
The prosecution of Nanterre has ordered the district police department of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The maniac was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out being transferred to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers had to take him to the police station in Clichy where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overarousal" like "all the spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the process."
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for a new stop to the prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski, for the repeated time on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), has called for the prosecution of his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer of the director of the "pianist," has denounced in front of three judges of the Appeals Court in the second district of California serious procedural errors at the time of the negotiations in 1977.
I am now calling for a penalty, Mr. Hummel said, before he added that the behaviour of the judge, Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "let it run down your back."
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who has now died, had discussed with a public prosecutor before he was given his term of office, who should have told him that Roman Polanski had earned a breeding house -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and designed" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and sought), especially by the inquestion prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary film.
If the Court of Justice refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel will require the conduct of a process which would allow him to submit the evidence of his argument.
The indictment, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained at first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the facts put to the defendant cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, before the release of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He has not travelled to the United States since that time.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had said that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
In this matter, would you like to spread the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who are a way out of the way?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thus despises his authority."
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to announce their decision - even pointed out that "there are other escape alternatives."
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the termination of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also once again demanded the lifting of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any rebirth of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending any extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise in the dollar and closes without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a course in a market that was torn between better indicators than in the US and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq has delivered 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is pretty quiet," Mace Blick Silver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think that this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "contributed to the improvement of the market view to the soundness of the recovery of the economy," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarised.
In the US, sales in the retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, which is already two months in a row and far more than expected.
In addition, US consumers' confidence has improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared with 67.4 in the previous month, according to the Michigan University index.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level against the euro for two months, "pushing down the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost a little bit of ground.
The obligation market has fallen.
The return on the 10-year-old Treasury bond increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, compared with 3.482% on the 30-year-old bond to 4.497% on 4.492% of the previous day.
Miss World's election again in South Africa
After a month of tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates to the title of Miss World on Saturday will cross the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already taken their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was just extraordinary.
I have seen many things and have had a lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with great enthusiasm.
This competition is held for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 pm (3 pm Central European Time).
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, stressed Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with female candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes."
After a month of gala, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, and to imitate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywoodstars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but this is not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country, and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is highlighted with music and dance.
The female candidates defile in traditional costumes and not to be forgotten in the swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and a responsible for the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with an inexorable heart and pride, assures Julia Morley, President of the Miss World.
The women candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, but this time it cost by bike and local cuisine.
But the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was very extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (south-west) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never approach.
I will certainly return to the World Cup 2010, promised with enthusiasm Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, told David Hallyday to the press when he got out of the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 1: 00 local time (21: 00 CET).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go "quickly" to the hospital of Cedars-Sinaï, where Johnny Hallyday was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up after an operation on a tape disc incident on November 26.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles in order to ease his strong pain and to be able to do his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma, in which he was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up after a tape-disc operation on November 26.
The singer had to undergo another operation on the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the disease caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event in the French high school of Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of the orthopaedic and traumatological surgery department at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer had a heavy burden on the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique Internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely indignant, Mr. Camus said.
I've heard of the possibility of a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "travelled far too fast and with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles."
I made a personal phone call with this doctor who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I myself have already had two tape disc operations, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer would have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything."
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist's environment.
He had been operating the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain bleed.
He is, however, also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has been sentenced several times for failing operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medical Chamber, called him "a man without scruples," who has to answer "regularly" to the board board and "anything but recommended."
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He said that the intervention had been "perfect" and that the post-operative investigations had been "normal."
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been encountered since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) party alliance becomes strong and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to no longer use its seal
The party alliance, which is being monitored by François Bayrou's MoDem party, on Friday responded strongly to a takeover attempt by the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the president of the Nouveau Centre Party, Hervé Morin, and asked him to use it on no document, under the threat of a judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he felt that François Bayrou was not worthy of defending this political heritage after he had given his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, also wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday in front of the National Council of the NC.
In order to strengthen his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC), who is entitled to the property of the UDF brand, as he was the first to apply for this brand at the "Institut national de la propriété industriale" in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF Party Association, under the supervision of François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they did not let themselves be taken away and set a time limit for the Minister and the Member, under the threat of a judicial persecution, to no longer use this seal and to transfer the property rights of the brand to her.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF-Siegelzu +, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party MoDem and the senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogan + of today's UDF + printed on their political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF's office and called on the party NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (its) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal beneficiaries."
If you refuse to do so, we will take action against you in order to give respect to the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave them in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the party "UMP."
The party Nouveau centre, according to the signatories, has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a department to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "he was not a member of the UDF for three years at the time he applied for the brand name" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and deceptive way from the lack of the deposit of the UDF acronym to carry out this for himself.
In addition, you will be aware that this recklessness is on the best way to turn into a crime, and the strategy of the NC is ironic: "It seems more dignified to us in politics and in life to make a name for ourselves rather than trying to get out of anonymity by taking a name, in a deceptive way, on which one has no legal rights."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
The Nanterre Court of Justice decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighties to get some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his start photos, will have to answer on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weakness in court, a crime that is punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that, in fact, there will be a process in this affair worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are tearing up and at the same time have the reins of the Cosmetics Empire L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially not under the conditions provided during the investigation by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010, in which you will make it clear whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will be subject to these investigations.
I will talk to her, said the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, who has to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal case against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accused him of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years in order to make a total of EUR 1 billion in bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considered a long-standing friend.
Although the Court would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
The lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt has called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she disgraces the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to your lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Could you please tell my daughter that I have written to Banier for 15 years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since she was married. "
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office once again considers that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardianship judge has in recent days rejected her request to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place, "said the DA's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the proceedings for the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers have taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of the strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best as it was previously designed on consumer products by the technicians in the plant.
By placing customers in the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose preferences of the customers again regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon that affects the employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R & D, which is even more decisive, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) calls for "a proactive approach and a forward-looking view of all the parties involved"; it claims from the employees a commitment to which the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
This is why we are calling for an operational revolution that would be to place the employees at the centre of the company's concerns on an equal footing with the customers.
The very benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its wage-earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that, in the face of a new situation, the whole structure, after a lot of detours, is finally about to do what it's always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most managers have a very simplified idea of human behavior.
From the large engineering schools their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They take over the old behaviorist theory through intellectual comfort, which has recently been reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and unknowingly spread across research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "lever" (sic) for the commitment of employees, a current Le Figaro.for Ipsos' published survey strengthens the leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is not suitable for the present world.
Identify and measure the mobility factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for the wage-earners, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of implementing part of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given Doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers to achieve their life objectives through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobility factors, companies' managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings Obama's praise from the right
On Friday, American rights welcomed the speech given by Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo and was pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked the award to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the President's speech, the example of the former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the US Today daily newspaper, and added that she herself raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way to explain his decision nine days ago, to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, this speech was quite historical, said Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway."
The previous Member, who is considered by some to be a possible candidate for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and could not give a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has "made a very American speech."
In addition to the fact that he is a "cosmopolite," as "he always does," he "spoke like an American president," when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much for their protection," Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, high-bearing and uninspiring."
On the left-hand side of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of the judiciary, you can easily justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains praising at the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was given early on to Obama, described the speech itself as "monumental work" for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a timetable for the management of international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California daily is delighted.
The New York Times believe that Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and called his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Remote drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that guarantees the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that would end the strike order and the threat of severe supply shortages at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement that was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early on Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours went by from the beginning of the meeting at 11: 00 to the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed at 6: 00.
The conflict "would have done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus increases from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"This is not very much, but we start first," said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now being instructed not to block the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some opposites who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement," although it was "difficult to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is €170 per month for the low and €100 to 120 for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and for the total budget for road transport to be maintained in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow the issue of 13 months' salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the fall in the taxes on employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 draft law on adjusted finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies connected to this organisation and then, in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour, to apply to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time," assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to digest the goose-eaters on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra laments.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "threatens to make a big grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector over the next 12 months."
Line RER A: Disorders this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The incidents on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Greater Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), which will keep the strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10: 00 and 20: 00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for use and only one of four trains was ready for use outside the central line.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the passengers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big business with traffic."
The RER A line passes through the Paris conurbation from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the villages of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains operated on schedule at the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human wreath on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adapted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) had been far less overrun than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29) said that he had "got up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to the passengers by staff and staff, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left through Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results which the associations had considered to be "poor" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-standing wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged by the fact that the RATP itself put its wage supplement proposals in brackets and stressed that "the top of the lead is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting on "comprehensive working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again it was the top of the lead, which so far rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after a pre-announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations call for a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 Euro, of which 30 Euro are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of passengers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, have a gross wage of between €2,200 and €2,700 and a wage supplement of €600 to €650 for shift services, as well as for Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party; a decision followed immediately by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have lasted for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to hold the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including the president Ahmet Türk and the parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political process for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity that Türk and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders said before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet like non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court interferes with the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and to propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to seal the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-outbreak of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
The order forces used tear gas grenades and water launchers when the demonstrators began to throw molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the judgment, Türk assumed that the decision of the court "will deepen the despair even further."
"Turkey cannot clarify this question (Kurdish, address the editorial staff) on the basis of a party's ban," he said to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems, "said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously get ready for a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK committed itself to an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days ago, one of the most brutal attacks in the past few months.
The snow break can come
A really tight winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
But so that his employees can learn to test and control the entire vehicle technology.
This weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be this far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are available to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is based on a detailed plan.
As soon as it is snowing in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-lines are being run with large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire-fighting routes, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradient, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at 3: 00 in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres should be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better held.
This is why the FES starts at 3: 00 at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts."
It will be difficult when it snows at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the scattered vehicles."
Only after that, if it is no longer snowing, will it be the turn of the supply and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, white Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES 'foot people are on their way, and the danger points and transitions are cleared up as a priority.
The FES could not take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which will keep an eye on the bridges from 22: 00 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As there are on this fast smoothing, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, the police will also call the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, report Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was in a dry zone of the Pangaea supercontinent at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as new species.
In the course of the excavation, they brought together the remains of five individuals.
Found confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "Dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the present teaching opinion, the dinosaurs first showed up about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the assignment of these original dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the lizards split into their three main development lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds, which were known as the "long-legged" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithichia (bird-basin-sauri), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At the head of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also own the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and light-building bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
As a result, the three lines of development split up early and spread from South America over all parts of the world, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangaa.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not very closely related theropods.
The three cannot come from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be a distorted picture, because in South America, a great many primitive Dino fossils have just been preserved, while on other continents there is little to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare side line of the reptile stem to the dominant farmers of the Middle Ages, is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the air-hauliers and with numerous other lizards.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border from the Trias to the Jura died out.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteor impact of a group of animals, which had also developed in the Trias and has since been in a dark state, has helped to flourish: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California, are the professors of the University of Toronto.
Lecturers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, as well as universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and teachers in the education strike last week because walls and works of art had been embellished.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command."
The eviction was an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the disbelief and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau had withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the occupants had not supported the damage, they say.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi and the German Trade Union Confederation are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessens Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the Unipresident and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the Union.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Land Day.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, according to the CDU-member Peter Beuth.
The opposition groups in the SPD, the Green and the Left saw this differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they had been cleared.
The left has tabled a motion which calls on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality is considered a "Russian Silicon Valley," with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 km from the center of Moscow.
Important research and production facilities for microelectronics and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science site Riedberg - with the institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation."
The Moscow Vice-Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, and the planning officer Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It's a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ are made possible to take a foot in the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist city of plans for arms research."
Selenograd (literally "Grünstadt") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stutzgarter Brachklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the project's supporters, it is simply a question of "the new heart of Europe."
S21 is much more than the deep-down of a station, more than a monstrous construction project that will overthrow the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital for a decade into a careless building site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headlines with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then considered to be traffic-related fossils of the 19th century, which seemed to be brake blocks of modern rail traffic, since it once took a great deal of time to restretch locomotives from the back to the front.
Take it, hold it, go on, go on, go on.
And that is why the railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located about half a line of the trans-European rail-magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe."
S21 is now actually being addressed, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and the Bavarian big city it is almost priceless to implement the deep.
However, headstations no longer have an entry and exit problem since there are modern turning trains with engines and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21, together with the ICE new line to Ulm, is now being addressed.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not the state group are borne.
The project can still be justified to some extent by urban planning.
It creates new city space, which - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger transport, to which - typical 80's - huge growth was attributed.
At that time, there was not yet the competition of the low-cost aircraft.
Modern transport policy must, however, first of all be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy increases.
It is even more serious that S21 is indirectly also doing many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros will be spent in the Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long line through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on the track in the slow motion.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rheintal line becomes a bottle for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government is examining judgment on the airport
The state government left open in the Wiesbaden Land Day whether it would go in review against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban on night flights.
The CDU / FDP coalition had commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH judgment examined legally, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On those days, the VGH in Kassel had written a statement that the country had to reregulate the night-to-day ban in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt airport.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided by the state government, is not compatible with the legal protection of the public against night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is going to be revised against the judgment.
The opposition criticised this postponement and called on the government representatives to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this was to be regarded as "breaking words."
It is very hard to keep your word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in allusion to the FDP election slogan "We keep the word."
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to get to their night flights with "right-wing and trickery."
An accurate legal examination takes time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legal decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition was, his group's statements on the ban on night flights had never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-stricken US large banks are shutting off their government bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund in a total of 45 billion dollars (over 30 billion euros) to a single blow.
The Citigroup also plans to return state aid, according to a report by the US station CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions on the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of management bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America was worried about convertible bonds of a good $19 billion of fresh money from investors.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled by, among other things, part sales.
On Wednesday evening, head of bank Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer: The money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house was at the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market to exempt itself from its liabilities to the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, reported CNBC by calling on circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Fast choice
It all went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the body wanted to vote on the staff.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the station for this - officially, in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role in not further damaging the ZDF's director Markus Schäger if this proposal is not to be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 Gremium members.
The result of the vote has not yet been established at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, Schäger had failed in the Board of Directors.
Only seven members voted in favour of Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's choice was a sharp defeat for the tenants, but one expected.
The Union majority in the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in office.
The Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief.
In the argument that under Brender the news of the ZDF had lost its ratings, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until just before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
In the last few years, even 35 state-law activists had been involved in the debate, who considered the action of the cook to be unconstitutional.
It didn't use anything.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
= = = ZDF = = = In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, and in 1983 to ZDF.
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the chief editor; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "morning magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens, after the election of Brender, who was still elected as a journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday, announced a constitutional action.
Koch's opposition to the Board of Directors, the Rheinland-Pfalzian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF Treaty so that the staff proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the board with a wise move - by strongly criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both tenants without loss of face for the position of the editor-in-chief and the board of directors without being suspected of having a party member.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is in any case attributed to the left-wing liberal.
Study is dismayed
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the country's ministers of culture finally set in on Thursday: at a meeting of the Ministers of Education and University Rectors' Conference, both sides agreed to improve the conditions of study at Bachelor and Master's.
The students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of testing: in principle, each study module should only complete a single test.
In addition, the work burden of students will be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable measure" will be ensured.
In addition, policy-makers and universities want to simplify the recognition of audit services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no different country rules.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, cult ministers and university rectors have had the winged word of better student ability in their mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in part dramatically: "Each module usually closes with only one test," it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially reregulate the admission of study programmes.
The "significant reduction in the audit burden," said the Accreditation Council President Reinhold Grimm, was intended to stop "a misdevelopment that significantly affected the ability to study."
In addition, the "ability to study" in the future should be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
In this context, it is important to note that, in the case of a number of other countries, the number of students in the European Union has increased by more than 10% in the case of the United Kingdom.
This is the first time that the European Union has been able to take action in this area.
The students would have "the right to have room for manoeuvre that would allow and promote their own initiative."
The rules should apply to the approval of new courses, but also to the review of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all programmes to be reviewed.
It is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies in the country, which are under the authority of the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture "urged" the countries to influence the agencies in such a way that the fabric is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and technical colleges have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz pledged additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
The main aim of the money is to set up tutors' programmes and to strengthen study advice and audit and foreign offices.
Land and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to bring an amendment of the law on higher education to Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The design of the study will be more flexible, and the recognition of evidence of performance at other universities will be ensured and access to the master will be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all the country's programmes will be checked for their ability to study.
The government and the opposition had again argued on Thursday about the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso higher education groups called for the design of education policy to be no longer "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, students as affected should now also "share a word."
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermand: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the cult ministers with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Education and Science Union (GEW) did not go far enough in general: it demands a legal claim that allows each graduate with a Bachelor's degree to have access to a further master's course.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that the current generation of Bachelor students will have enough master's places with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to recruit much more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their views on free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Incoming in Germany and coming out is almost no control... "is the starting line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he, in disturbing language, addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a teacher in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literature awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetic Lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a considerable exonlitarian appearance last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror of their securitates."
Söllner was, in some cases, insecure and repudiated a statement in which he admitted his cooperation as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Securitate, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In 1989, Söllner and some of the present members received the German Language Prize.
The recruitment attempts would have started with a slight start, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "so someone who has not fought against intimidation of the Securitate enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary approach to the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of the German authors from Romania, is being shaken by a case that shows the abyss and the abyss of a political system based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say according to previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner by the literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He "cut him out" in all the difficult points he had at that time, said Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not quite surprising.
Germany had been a comfortable reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July, after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The affected, one may suspect, will be speculated and in some cases have probably also known which clear name was hidden behind the names Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the fact that the stasi files are now being viewed in a more procedural way, the handling of the assets of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic education has been pursued and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Processing of Securitate Files (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler Authority, was established only in 1999, but the issue of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller made an interview in which a former Securitate head from Temesvar spoke abruptly about the winner.
She's got a psychosis, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the case of Söllner, as is so often the case in the context of hidden guilt, is based on inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was hurt? The gentle response of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need for knowledge rather than by the guilt-allocation and shame.
It is more than a footnote to the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Satisfaction supplement Champions League
It seemed as if an adret-dressed outside service had just come from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sports product manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, went into a given C-class a quarter after midnight.
The man with the distinctive bald was chauffeur because of the city he was still a stranger to.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with luck.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow's work goes on.
Or let's go.
In the words of the only three days previously committed Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final," that is, in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is due on Sunday.
In Mainz, it is then necessary to repeat the royal class performance in the daily league.
And to turn off the weaknesses that have been revealed again after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), Schäsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
draw
The eighth final of the Champions League (16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / 9 / 10 / 16 / 17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the full-fledged presence of the Babbel successor was thus maintained.
Not only with the supposed salvation charm, who had in the short time self-confidence, commitment and the joy of playing to the unsafe professionals in Stuttgart.
I went to the players and told them that they should remember their strengths, and I stopped them to be more courageous, Soul Clumper Gross explained the simple-sounding recipe for success, which, however, had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has kindled a certain magic, admitted Babbel-proponent Jens Lehmann, "If a new impulse comes in football, things happen sometimes that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a few weeks of injury, became the best player on the square, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way in which the new superior worked: "He is a man who takes through and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel, it had obviously been a good thing.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns the sports board Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs above all consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful not to overestimate the victory against a less-favoured and completely overburdened defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen the evil awakening had come at 0: 4, gave Khedira to remember.
And the head of the sports board, Horst Heldt, warned that although one season target was reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory for three months, Heldt was not happy to celebrate, was due to the events of the weekend, which in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game, was revived.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt met with the hard criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown the board's leadership weakness and decided to change training on pressure from puberting fans.
The fact that his day off had been cancelled after games, Lehmann also regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and misfortune.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt remarked and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work by the team of the team of the trained, the playful and militarily strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
WM-Fight in the heavyweight
Hitchy duel in Bern: repeatedly provocated challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds the Ukrainian defended his heavy weight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the box world champion in the heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after the version of the association WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously in the night of Saturday in Bern after points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian was the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the K.O. everyone was expecting.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, he had to give himself twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-metre-tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
However, the 11-centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, has repeatedly disbanded the beating of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not achieve his dangerous rights.
In total, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over it.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of 12 laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided some vortex before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "ugly zombie," who "can't do anything right."
When he was weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of time, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "took back his" WBC belt, which he had previously left without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the USA.
I only got one shot in this fight and am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA's belt, however, is worn by the British David Haye, who was able to dethrone the two-13-metre-tall Nikolai Waluyev in November.
In the summer, Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko, which was planned for September.
It is said that his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembleystadion.
Kunduz case
Front attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called defence minister Guttenberg a liar for false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to recent findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has assumed a conscious deception.
The Minister had said "knowingly the intruth" to the deadly bombing on two tank trains of September, said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news show "Tageschau."
It's called a country-by-country, he lied.
The order to kill had been given in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday it was announced that the attack was not only about the destruction of the abducted trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the Nato investigation report, the US air attack requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein had been killed or injured by up to 142 people.
On Saturday, the Green, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Federal Chancellery, the Federal Armed Forces and the Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, asked Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künnast.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office had not had any influence on the concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry on the background of the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the information provided by the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have informed correctly and fully about the background of the tanker attack.
It was officially said that they had denied the existence of the Nato reports and denied the Minister's sensitive details.
The two top officials, however, reported that they had even referred to several reports by the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is now said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung."
He had not received an answer so far, it is said.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Committee of Inquiry, which is to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear in a vigilant state.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and in the drug rush that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's all right.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves to the wildest ideas and imagination.
However, in the modern Western world, those who experience sad conditions, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted, at least as a special.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the case of the mentally ill or in the case of the drug.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, to paint pictures or to write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blurred.
Sadly changed state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Even if triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystical Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychosis and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of the neural messenger material of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection of delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and medical practitioners since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of a dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of misconduct with dream states," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, sensations of such a kind."
It's autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic book.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he hovering on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devils with blood-red, distorted fratten, tendering.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain on the whole body.
Loud, evil voices roam from walls and radio.
He can't stand them any more, the voices that are insulting and insulting him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, knocks them to a noose and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He's getting on a speaker and he's gonna lay the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The noose is disappearing.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in the drum-fur-breaking choir, "go to the clinic and be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one is two years ago, the first one is almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is shizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis I have experienced the worst fear and deep despair, he says.
The Trugpictures are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population is suffering from schizophrenia at least once in the life of schizophrenia, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common post-depression disease.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inside and the outside world, they are in an overdeveloped state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice hearing is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Also optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The person concerned is no longer able to separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the General Psychiatry Clinic in Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning for it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot make them active.
Schizophrenes therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible for them, the trugpictures are cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
To have experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, is in principle preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain is beating capriols, researchers are still facing a mystery.
Exceptional conditions can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in the case of those affected.
We suspect that the neural maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But there remains a mystery about how the disturbance of the neural system comes about, which, in addition, does not manifest itself for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the cause of a psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says the Lübeck Psychology Professor Erich Kasten.
It is often only a question of the position whether tru-images are felt to be pleasant or unpleasant.
For ten years, Kastel has been collecting reports of hallucinations and truders, and last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head."
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of amazing many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain is hallucinating healthy people.
Hallucinations, according to the box, are made up of memory contents that are normally held back.
They occur when brain areas where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the attraction, stress, love, or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents said that they had experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the high school.
A normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the pictures and the voices.
In the break it may happen that a sloppy boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it answers him, the students look at it as a surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
You think the shy girl is a spun day dream, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other trugpictures are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are mostly frightening
Often the trugpictures are also a load.
When she is in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher is presenting a new student in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations for all the others.
At night, the apparitions are mostly frightening.
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which is too rare and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees are the fratten or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her about it, they'd think they were crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from stimuli, he is highly likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kachel.
I guess the brain is then under-occupied, and it's even taking care of its entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called Dad since she could think was not her physical father.
As in visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish between trugpictures and reality. "Every experience," says Kachel, "is in the brain," the reality is in the brain, and the reality is in the brain.
Hallucinations are also pictures that the brain creates, that's why they seem so real. "
Also night-long dream images value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenic, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their trugpictures as unreal.
Kastel therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Boundary state between dream and hallucination
In our too consciousness-centered world, imaginary experience is, unfortunately, pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, suffering disease, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumically changed consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the living person considers real and which he cannot, in retrospect, distinguish from the state of wax.
The oneiroid state of consciousness is created in extreme traumatic or disease-related situations, for example in polyradikulitis patients who are fully aware of motor paralysis.
When a human being is threatened with self-loss and world loss, for example by continuous, complete immobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
It's kind of a state of a border between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of sensuality and sensuality in an in itself unbearable situation, which allows us human beings to be able to design, not to go down in a nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Wahrkapel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness is travelling for days after a heart valve operation with a heart transplant, while his body is sentenced to non-movement in the intensive care centre.
Claussen dips into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles who produce narcotics from blood.
It is taken by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in the salt snow of the Alps and hitting a Korean mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are very clear to me after years and in minor details.
More clear and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience is breaking the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, Oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of the outer reality are also in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist sums up box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.
The snow break can come
Burda
Children should take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new publishing director Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term Hubert Burda wants to put his company in the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old to the SPIEGEL.
We have taken care of the details.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only then asked.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This will kill the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the Board of Directors from January and have appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Management of Burda since 1999.
At first he was in charge of technology.
Later on, the treasury sector added responsibility for the company's assets and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also for direct marketing, foreign countries, pressure and finance.
This is the first time that a family member is not at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who was 42 today, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100% of the family, said Burda.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not safe before the end: "This always affected families who were infected by a capital search that had completely speculated and thought that they could thus become a big player.
My strategy never was.
He had never had "world power dreams," says Burda.
I do not see myself as the political precursor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Full beauty
Everything you wish for in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has been doing, which has recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m ² in the mall in Callao, Madrid, where everything is about personal care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide for a dehair with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that has more than 130 different types of tea due to its tea house.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your legs with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m ², which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for the hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to perform your training sessions properly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm up and stretching) will be enough to train the body muscles.
And then, after you have trained your body, you want to stop by the hairdresser's salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments for the recovery of the hair splendour, the gloss and the health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10: 00 a.m. to 10: 00 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer, so it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their gowns into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are a few proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. You can only guess from that.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE office."
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the road map for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to sum up opinions and measures in the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa is taking part in the promotion of the electric car.
The company is involved in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies the Spanish car industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace."
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures the government has taken to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would now have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government said that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to boost demand, in reference to the 2000 plan, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the number of registrations that "increased by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
Madrid is the first edition of the International Classic Motor Fair, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental sportsmanship
Mazda wants to prove that sportsmanship is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, christened to the name i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is only available for the 2.0 petrol engine at the moment.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out because of its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" for the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can find that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomics and good hold.
The game of the steering wheel is also excellent.
When looking at the unit, which is made up of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is in the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civic.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of the German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive comfortably outside by car.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-gear connection.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out through its fineness, its soft sound, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the gear and its low consumption, even if Mazda's diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The main feature of the series is the RVM, which thus removes the dead angle, but also the control elements for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive internal mirrors, on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, as well as the chrome-plated 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes the Premium package, which for an additional 1,500 euros contains the following: in addition to other elements, especially the learning bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loaders.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative of this model is its somewhat high price, which lies between 21.770 Euro for the Luxury and 23.270 Euro for the Sportive model.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving fun every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine," the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as elegant as ever, chose a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is above all limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without a possibility to see certain attachments or to surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of glory when it chose Time as one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea in itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has launched two new devices: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free data service, in contrast to the Peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits, however, as its American counterpart, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euro per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to renounce all the data in order to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the border or when you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good pair of glasses to read all the small print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that is right.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon even though it does not have a Wifi / WLAN) can offer this type of tariff means that telephone providers have to slowly, but safely rethink and start to consider different ways of using their network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and the prices include downloading books and further requests on the Internet.
No vetrag and no hook.
This is an internet-enabled device and one pays only once, in the case of the purchase, and not month by month.
And that is exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a way of buying with life-long internet access, as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and coat of this color and re-chose the same color to accompany him at his, without a doubt, second-most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric, and she was wearing something big-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It is even so far as it seemed at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a dress of lace and in Oslo a velvet made of patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with half-high heels and for the second time, though an attractive model, but golden.
The hair was different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, and the previous one was wearing the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market as being limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they do.
Those of them who do no other job outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed contract of employment, become more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, are postponing the establishment of a family and maternity and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the 35-49 age group with a fixed job receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the date of the move together, a figure which increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have moved together and the first child have only realized much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, though less than the calendar in terms of the willingness to receive a conception, "explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they have only primary or higher education, became mother for the first time, on average, at 25.1 or 32.1.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with a master's degree get married before their first permanent job and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly the other way around and first seek a permanent job and get married and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his all-envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also tell the well-known advertising "Because you are worth it."
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël," one of the most elegant actors on an international level, will thus become another famous sign as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
The last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy ') and Matthew Fox (actor of Evangeline in" Lost ").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They all appeared on this occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the thirty x-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and terrifying genre (short biography, life and work), but rather is looking for an anxiety to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on terror or enlightenment.
Except that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt, without having found any words for it: joy in contrast to the unhealing fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegory Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between fainting and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humour, without any sense, like the knife blades that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was drawn by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, to the extent that the emotions in whose flesh, due to adultery, united with the pleasure of repentance, were a spiritual privilege, which was to come to heaven on the detour of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 800th peaks in world literature, one must climb up on the north wall, on the wall on which the best mountaineers try again and again. "
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny chick.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were born of a certain size. "
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy cry that was proclaimed by a bridge from that person from Munich, so that his echo could be held in his literary way until the night of the 20th century. This was what he did on a journey in which he fled from himself and, with a speech of violence, begged the afterlife of the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power to finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are engraved by Spencer: 'sleep after the effort, / after the thunderstorm of the port, / the rest after the war, / after a good life you will find a favor in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII spied on her between the Azaleas or the birds sang in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness. "
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to get Joyce in Baroja?
What was Benet's intention if he didn't bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this pedestal? "
Mad aggression
My 70-year-old mother went for a walk last week through our district in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixed one that we took from the shelter and that weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they missed him two feet and hurt him hard.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpful animal is to be, of course, carried out on the leash.
In addition, there is the suffocation that a woman who went for a walk was given when she wanted to bring these people to justice because of the incident, she was even afraid for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older man, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a usually quiet neighborhood at 5: 00 in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this is going to do anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the very beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people to find a cheap attack on a helpless animal, an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
The aim of this initiative is to draw attention to the importance of the use of the helmet, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "includes far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure with each day" and further confirmed that it also contributes with other actions of a educational and informative nature to getting closer to this objective every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will in a first phase distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because it is always committed to the development of ever safer products as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles.
The sale of small-scale trucks is increasing again
After almost two years, the car market for small vans finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase ever after 22 consecutive months, with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac and the Ganvam Association of Automakers.
However, these good figures are only to be enjoyed with great caution at the moment, as the reference data used for comparison in November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of sales, with a decrease of 60% on the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all the vehicles that make up the retail market: passenger cars, pick-ups, small vans, small vans and lighter small trucks / chassis.
Furthermore, the same thunderclouds in the sky are still the most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the large part of the sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
For example, these restrictions, which are the result of the credit institutions' turned-down money-tap, must include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E has helped little.
This plan, however, is not only for private individuals, but also for the self-employed and small enterprises, have a right to buy a small van of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 output not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us that it is essential for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks and, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The association of car dealers is prophesying a similar year for 2010 to the one that just passed, for which it is expected to have a sales failure of 19% (in the case of passenger cars and off-road cars).
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock braking system and as is now the case with the stability control ESP, the emergency braking systems must be a compulsory release in European cars.
In fact, they are already required for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, and for the remaining vehicles a waiting period was fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measures adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent a lot of road accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake manoeuvre, which the system recognizes by the driver's braking strength on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even get to the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not stopped with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car passes during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents that damage pedestrians could be avoided every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistance.
There would be even fewer accidents - one is expected to prevent one in four accidents with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
The vehicle is then equipped with a system that recognizes obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, and at the same time it already has a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if it is necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors is moving the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the party concerned to give its agreement on each of the points of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skype sports car, who has a back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever greater support.
If any of these buyers were to have an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and, after all, managed to make it 80 kilos easier, with it now only 1,275 kilos on the scale.
In order to create such a thing, they first renounced the automatic flap-up roof, which was replaced by a window-wall roof with manual drive, so that one saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3, another 15 "disappear"; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; in addition, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kilos; by the installation of sporty bacquet seats, another 12 and with the light 19-inch rims again.
Then the CDR-30 audio system had again reached six kilos less and the missing kilos by the exchange of the door handles by handles made of fabric.
Although it is also available with the double-coupling transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a 6-standard hand-driven vehicle, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain routes, which were really very curvy.
In his driving behaviour, you can only give him the note impeccable.
The reduction of its weight, however, has in no way led to the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not had such a small and light model, which gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming his muscles at a low course in the required time, until we give him the orders to ride, to slow down, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again...
He does everything he's told. The car does everything we tell him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and it can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration is unimaginable brutal, whether from standing out or from re-accelerating.
The suspension is strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the road, on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car was able to master the potholes.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and that, although we found some of these curves of ice in the morning and rolling-stock in the morning.
In conclusion, it is an ultra-rich car, a car with which you have an unspeakable driving fun, as otherwise it is rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster S.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl '
The singer, a business friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Cosmeticline Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same colossal rigidity as her pockets of Chanel.
A lot more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," she's a "Bag Girl."
The Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboratory, despite the many failed players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complex foot-ball field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the big appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of work and teamwork, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated three times contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blue red, who sat at the top of the display board from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team already came out of the perimeter from Vitoria, one could already imagine that they had come to the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava chose an inside game of Barac and the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to be the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" evaluation of splinter had already shown that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
However, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game was not decided yet and the Makkabaeans wanted to remind the Vitorians that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eizson and Pnini contributed significantly to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything but dead, had to prepare a few plays with meeting security to get back air and with one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the display panel showed a reassuring distance of (54-67), which the host could embellish at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavesen were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earnestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eizson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and even though splinter was placed off the ground because of Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended well and even though the Israelis were still catching up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in group B of the Euroliga to him, and this was in a game marked by the failure of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first-quarter performance, the Andalucians were allowed to begin to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts at 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of his unicaja, even though the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortanitis managed to show the display panel in their favour in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which, due to an action, the two Americans were almost in a fight between Beverley and Williams and both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to get warm and his superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-made mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left a clear mark on the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian foreman Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, was superior and even managed to balance the difference of the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn brought the leadership within the group into a swing.
Unicaja tried to get over the many failures and the removal of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to the lead and the three-fold of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came again for 66-57.
However, it was actually impossible, because as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, the Olympiacos was not to be slowed.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give himself up and have to take the lead at Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook because of your profile?
Facebook users can now experience their salary due to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn because of their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. The users can enter a form in Facebook in which their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
After a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average felt "bad paid," explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has on its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a French 33,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros that a Spanish deserves.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with EUR 11,592 per year net; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14,725 and the work of a worker with EUR 15,667.
The most sought-after places on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, a half-day job and a social worker.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya to stay in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President who has been deprived of office must leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest, if his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of the country, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, as his mandate is running out that day and he has to find a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the date set: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," said Zelaya on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, because of Zelaya's refusal to recognise the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you.
After the most tempting days of the past spring, when the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned in the markets, which is in no way surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to pay the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to allow liquidity to be left free at interest rates that are around zero so that banks can buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost over and, without questioning their heterodoxic liquidity policy, they are starting to spread some sand into the transmission, as the BCE has already set out with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
Therefore, investors are doubting the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterogeneous measures and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in the business bonuses are increasing again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to state private risks and public debt is rising again.
It is now time to return to quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred destination for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area in terms of Germany.
Spain has hardly been affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision down on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy, for what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects that the limitation of credit led to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to have decided a new day of thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirates in order to restore the power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was already foreseen earlier.
A government that is not in the state's debt, elections and a new government that is in the same line.
In Italy, Prodi made it to Berlusconi and Sócrats in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from the non-payment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus to allow a euro member country to no longer meet its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens on the need for external measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, facing an episode of normalisation of the risk premiums, after some leaking to too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same speed as the European business bonuses.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and Spanish increased, this would be a special Spanish risk.
This is a farce from Standard & Poor's. While the indicators that have been drawn up here force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this does not promise a long life, despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "caution in driving" is required.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday in the Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy for Spain's energy supply will be discussed over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain must invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another EUR 60 billion from that date until 2030, subject to the requirement that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would be up to 95 billion, not 60 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international allies.
The question will change from 2020 and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more are needed, of course, under the condition of other "support energies."
Galán, who is of the opinion that the draft for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything against this law on how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, we are clearly in this direction, despite some" individual "measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
If it is what it is, Galán believes that the decisions on investment, even if they are long-term, should be taken now, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be set up to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at ground airports, the Swiss Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, on which no figures have yet been published, is set for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation yesterday to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to study energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants the construction completed at the end of 2014.
After the administration decided to work together with the public-private (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
Expected of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to $1.7 billion (€1.047 billion) of Australian dollars, with three consortia competing in the last phase, mainly with European construction companies.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues group, is fighting the team of Acciona.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, made up of the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises huge construction and privatisation, but it has a hurdle to overcome, because it is only through the purchase of a local construction company that you get access.
A strategy that has been followed by the mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be followed by the Spanish building giants.
Even ACS has access to this market only through its 30% stake in high-level, owner of the above-mentioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is of the highest importance in this geographical area for the industry, in which it is already well known as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry because of its activities.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to get access to the construction and infrastructure sectors.
The underground toll line, which is supported by the City of Brisbane's Infrastructure Office and is called the Northern Link (North Supply), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Towong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 km through tunnels. This is the largest measure to reduce congestion on the streets of Brisbane.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award of the contract for summer 2010 and for the start of the construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is already to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland is participating in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is ready for high-level business.
Australia continues to give considerable orders to high-level, which signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday.
The ACS sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre-optic cables through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast Internet connection for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and high-level has received 129 million.
In the UK, in Manchester, it is also competing with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 km long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the contract for the construction of the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) of over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine is increasing its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction work is planned to begin in early 2010 and its implementation will take more than 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services to the agency Sra. Rushmore for the next two years over a sum of about three million euros per year, the railway company informed.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented just to this competition, of which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty of over 63 million for France Télécom for the failure of the competition.
The French regulatory authority for competition has imposed a penalty of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has collected more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 on the grounds of the disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the competition authority believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore returned.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet to increase the income from transactions that do not result from the telephone connection.
In principle, this web page of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 for these victories to be made available to other countries, such as Spain.
The game in the Champions League has been in Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has been a source of revenue for the football clubs since its creation in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, which will give them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a source of fame. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992 / 1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has made the most money through its participation and the only one, next to the AC Milan, who won the trophy three times.
The current Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the fifth.
The list is based on Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams, who also received the most money by participating in the previous Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to take money through the champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, in contrast to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, which is chaired by Michel Platini, expects a revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (among them the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million thanks to their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 Euro) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that came to the eighth final each receive three million; the four that came to the quarter final, 3.3 million.
The last four will get 4 million each.
The winner deserves 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed revenue.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is given in proportion to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated places.
The master of last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% of the fourth.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's issue.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group, yesterday, leaked details of the purchase offer of shares, with which it intends to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, paid for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year as a result of this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa assesses the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 Euro reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz group will give the shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, even though Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had made contact with the Authority.
With a conclusion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos would be 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to stay on the verge of possible purchase offers and the judicial querels of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision to become the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the responsibility of the group's chairman.
This is all but free of polemics because the company is involved in a court battle because of the suspicion of a diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the loan of the Salazar, the former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) yesterday appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.

New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of weather and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are carried to the workshops where an expert has to assess the damage and the cost of the repair.
No single accident is the same and the calculation of the costs of the parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and hours of work, can take up to two or three hours.
But it is a matter of minutes with the support of the latest informatics tools.
This is why almost 100% of the evaluators use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs shall collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process them afterwards and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audtex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for assessment and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the sales manager of Audtex, it works with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is becoming more and more large, up to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorization have been on the market than in the whole of the fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the business will start to work.
It is a difficult task, because every single one of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image is created from each model, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure is in progress.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audtex has complete information in 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the road, it is over 99%.
For the purpose of the documentation work and the production of databases, Audtex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specialises in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audtex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the number or residual value of a car, depending on the country.
The only company that is informed about a guide that is about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audtex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In the review of the products that Audtex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the type of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for the assessment of accidents for the evaluators.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid according to the intended use, i.e. for each opinion.
It will be most expensive for customers who rarely use it for a maximum of ten times a month, namely EUR 5.75 per month.
In contrast, any insurance company that makes thousands of opinions is negotiating the price with Audtex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, one can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt, only using the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the specialist market on the Internet, which can be used to provide vehicles that have been declared to be total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or in obtaining information on the differences by brand and model.
For example, it can be used to study how many models of a particular car brand had to be in the workshop due to a breakdown or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for evaluators and provides in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT-Führer for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased over the last three years at 20% per year and in 2008 sales were 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
On the other hand, Audtex was founded in 1966 in Germany and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of their business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the Solera group (Audtex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Auction of car accidents on the Internet
In October last year, the group Solera Autoonline bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of car and motor vehicles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase next year to the remaining 15%.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added, with the possibility of getting access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrap shops and car dealers who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 are in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website today has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis numbers have been unregistered may no longer be used on the road, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, the cars with historical value may be re-registered even if they have been unregistered after difficult public authorities.
Estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audtex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model will appear and then the required spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the hours of work, extra prices or discounts, and after that he can print the estimate and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented approach does not include an estimated working time.
The use costs for this tool are 350 Euro per year, an amount that the customer can pay without any further delay.
The company Audtex is currently working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that automechanics have long been waiting for, for example, because you can select a door with it and then completely turn the picture around to look at the inside.
