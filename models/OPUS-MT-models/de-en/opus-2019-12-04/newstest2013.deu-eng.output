A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republicans' leaders justify their policies with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by affirming that election fraud in the US is less frequent than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republicans' lawyers have, by the way, recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the US.
In contrast to Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that have made the procedure for registration or the first step more difficult.
This phenomenon has become more important after the November 2010 elections, where 675 new Republican representatives have been registered in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo card and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a electorate on the day of the election, and give citizens the right to vote for which a court act is in place.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state asked the voters to show a photo card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutional nature of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, they have promoted draft laws in 34 states that force voters to show a photo card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million persons entitled to vote, do not have a photo card issued by a government authority in their country.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such an ID in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to get the required ID.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the necessary photo ID.
This is much more than that.
The students who are considered to be voters who give their votes more for democratic candidates are not allowed in several countries to use their photo card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations to choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require the voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes.
It is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters who prefer democratic parties.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators in eight states have promoted laws that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to help those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the electoral registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections have helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who have voted in advance were Afro-Americans, although they represent only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the white people, who represented 76% of the voters, represented only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The US Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the display of a photo card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear objective of influencing the results in the countries that are the key to 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have passed these laws are 171 out of the 270 votes required by the Electoral Board to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the US.
Prostate cancer past identification: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PPE test has sometimes faulty results, with false negative or also false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the men who have already been undecided to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies carried out in the USA, there were many disruptions between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in a 12-year follow-up, the probability of metastases formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really be made aware of the extent to which his cancer is at risk by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term and in these cases it is more likely to be actively monitored.
Today, there is no treatment for many men who have seen cancer, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and are offered treatment when the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should and who should not be treated are determined with increasing accuracy.
That's why I still recommend carrying out the test.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not he should be performed.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of becoming ill at it.
It is estimated that 30% of the cancer could be prevented if all were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian cancer society.
However, about 10% of the cancer is expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several of them remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It is a major damage to human health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the speaker André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the cigarette has been abandoned, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, grimma, mast, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against flu cancer throughout life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of a cancer of the flu or of the mast.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
But your studies are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian cancer society, the studies of vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found that there was a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed more of an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs-Boson Analyses
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs-Boson has caused some concern last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted, but has not yet been observed empirically, by the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that this is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be fully sure of it.
Let us still assume that this is actually the Higgs, as there seems to be a low risk of being wrong, and let us look at what it is.
There is an inevitable law in this world that causes two objects to not be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli principle of exclusion, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state," with this "state" largely consisting of some of their properties.
From this point on, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and are kind to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a bad band of anarchists, to whom nothing is holy - in any case not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the website The Particle Adventure, are divided into two groups from the Berkeley laboratories (which is by the way absolutely amazing): the mesons that we are not going to treat here and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature are spreading and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be stressed here, however, that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" right at this place, in about like a pebble stone that was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this boson is shown.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be feared by a very large rock.
This is why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep on the fridge by itself.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon by the way) do not have a mass.
What can all these research be "good" for now, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they are used to check the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists to examine all the differences between the observations and the forecasts of the SM.
There are, by the way, numerous physicists who are hopeful that such differences will be found, as the least difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (again up!).
However, such differences have not yet been found at CERN.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no research.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - already told us that the laser was in the beginning rather than a "laboratory play."
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and has presented it with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With her Committee on Dying in Dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which consumed him, had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said, half-hearted, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease is doing its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped with the food.
He is even able to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man is peeing standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
To return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"This depends on the ability of the person to take a step back," he notes.
In the opinion of several people who work in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these steps.
The patients who are introduced to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who take care of them will no longer be taken care of with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation."
But the disease really made me meet my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says, before she accepts that she is being put on a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days she still expects a last visit of her son, who comes from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home you can offer a group of volunteers and help with the food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care on a population of 11,700.
That is very little, considering that one day we will all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given a mouth care with brandy or pepsi as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike," reports caretaker Nathalie Savard.
There's no day at the Victor-Gadbois home like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well supported by his pillows, while he is attacked in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been filled with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois' home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to a care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in the health care of Quebecs that makes it possible for several doctors specialized in palliative care to look forward to the adoption of a law on the regulation of death aid and assisted suicide with concern.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent people of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quabec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all have the right to high-quality palliative care before being accepted to go to death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with a lot of pain without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients will only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologues treat their patients, despite worst forecasts, until the last day.
The chances of Hélène Richard's survival were already minimal when she stopped a hard chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she was sorry that I was giving up the fight, she said.
But she told me I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the care staff for not accepting this wish after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care company of the home palliative care of the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, the doctors often use the terminal sedation, which is to put the patient to sleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be more and more likely to use this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same sentence, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me down," but "I want my pain to be alleviated."
The implementation of this report was possible on the basis of a Canadian Health Research Institute's Journalism Scholarship.
Real estate scandals large scale in Quebec
The officials of the road building office, the companies of the main construction industry, the money procurers of political parties and the specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are involved.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer Quabec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has been disintegrated since the drastic measures have been taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, a member of Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was revealed by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of the disloyalty of the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only unwillingly agreed.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he says, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them were curbing their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it will be able to "show the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making a great effort with its troops to the government's auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Force," which since 2009 has led to the fact that the "Canalization Cartel" of Montreal is more restrained in the artificial inflation of the contracts...
In the last few weeks, she has made a series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against local leaders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having received several bribes in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Street Building Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were specifically charged.
The latter has raised concern by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the maintenance of public contracts.
He himself paid for several years 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary related to the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand everywhere in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals who were in power at that time.
He also confessed that he had organised illegal funding for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years' time he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewer-making contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they could be lubricated by artificially inflating the bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, one of the organizers of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overseeing a shadow budget that filled his funds with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to hit the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she was opposed to the sale of a community property, which was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to building contractors in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
The investigation that is being carried out in the end says that it "draws a thread that makes it possible to understand the functioning of the system under the control of ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we need an investigation unit for Montreal only, as well as an oversight to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, points out that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of the "leaders who are in the picture of the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
On the basis of a 70% share of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he wept: "I was told that this was only a weak clash of reality."
The government of Quebecs proposes to limit the donations to parties to 100 dollars, which according to him would not change the situation: "As long as election campaign expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
It recommends a complete revision of the system of public procurement and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; we can rebuild the House on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws, by taking the courage to get to the ground."
If this story is damaging the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who are laughing to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on her side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I do not break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne I have always made progress gradually.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals of this summer are used to performing games of very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to have a forehead and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Mackelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti is giving all the technicians respect.
There is currently no comparable person in the Ligue 1 and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he's gonna win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has put in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of the top rider.
We're in an ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto so that we can play the back-play of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a great European association, Paris has to win a title and make a long-term name for itself.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG provides itself with the means to ensure that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really important for us to take this title off.
We were close in the last season.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry the victory away.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We totally accept that.
But if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that we can be accused of, it is certainly a little frustrating.
You're wondering what else people are expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team is building up over time.
In the Champions League we have proven strength.
Look at Manchester City, an association that has not managed to qualify for the eighth final since two seasons, and which has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to be a 15-point lead for the game break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "booted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's all the better to talk about a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from making a little play.
I saw things there that made me stronger.
Today I am able to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus."
We have learned our lesson from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we have to show good practice.
What opinion do you have on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and encourages to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the tie imposed in Spain on 16 October (1: 1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.

The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin, created by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but can be converted into dollars, euro, etc.) and a protocol for the safe exchange, such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin had reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell five months later to 2 dollars before recovering to about 10 dollars today (the rates are listed on the website bitcoin charts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "credits" used to move forward in a video game that can be won or bought by games (and sometimes exchanged back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin all network nodes are at the same time depositors of the accounting book, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
The content of the file also makes it possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts' accounting book spread throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a disassembly of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked."
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
When this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for fraud twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided to a hundredth of a million, which leaves a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The weak point used does not concern the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced a payment that is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analysed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are out of circulation.
In November a "mega-sales" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," is Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
The Paytunia system is a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the dealers and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are reconsidered in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time to get Bitcoin through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, by the way, in its report provides for a reassessment of the various risks now considered to be high in the event of the success of this currency.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take over its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers by seeing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and the wounded.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Uzbekistan and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the western countries become more discrete.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoy, overflown by helicopters, have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban interference in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overtaken by the war due to the struggles of the various rebellious groups.
Their power was then seen as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business-makers by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They have discredited themselves, and most of them have not been involved in the fighting themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who have been able to make use of the American funds: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people are fed up with the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be given jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is seen everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militia in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralised state with strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular at the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, since the 1950s and long before, his country has been dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country that was based on 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan has immense resources.
This will increase the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to get over it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Ayak, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent.
The withdrawal of the French combat forces was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' gymnasia, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable work and measures in dozens of mountain villages for the rehabilitation of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which a large number of local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, well, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase agricultural land.
Which souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, which are often more than 2000 metres above sea level.
The message received dozens of written requests from small-scale agricultural projects by the municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their wish, the continuation of less, well-controlled and directly related civil aid in their favour would be necessary.
A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever in relation to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it unlimited authority, it has decided to put everything on one card.
To the surprise of everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this Assembly two additional months to complete his work.
Egypt has now been based on a provisional text, which has been amended several times for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal confusion.
This new initiative has only provided for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step right with his feet."
His supporters are assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period, which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians by section.
It is also a way for the President to find his public and democratic legitimacy again, while the protest is raging throughout the country.
After affirming in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
In the case of the Egyptian people, with this use of an overhasty vote, an ultimatum is given: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power of authority," the latter should probably end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 most of the Islamist members of this constitutional assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not responded to the request.
They have turned away just before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, as they believe that they have not been able to make their views known.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles have been adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the commuting clock of the constitutional assembly was not exactly going.
The text, which was adopted last night, is made up of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules," which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Objection" is the answer to the liberals who only consider this a propaganda strike.
They say that the Constitution is being Islamised by other articles.
They are particularly concerned with Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular as regards the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pimier, this is worrying because "the people who are asked to give an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy. "
The concerns of the liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the present one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system, "says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admitted, however, that "there may be a ambiguity in relation to Article 220, since the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, An. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In line with the request of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have called for.
The latter also share their concerns about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The situation of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the world's navel and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and an unspoiled nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Bow before the holy places
Visit the river Jordan where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus did his wonders: the conversion of water into wine at a wedding party, the walking on the water, the stalling of the sea storm and the fishing.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here commit the way of suffering or the way of the cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on the mountain Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the grave of Jesus are located.
This is the Christian view of the world's navel, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is located in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the Cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the clavings, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave a note of wishes there, which then come into being.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the Masada Fortress form the remains of the secret hiding place of enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in the year 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins of their own power.
All the others bring an airtrack to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters above sea level is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an old legend, pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old Qumranmanuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Judean Desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops there.
The entrance is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most gripping section is the monument for the children, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars are sparing.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died will be heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three most important recreational areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, delfinariums and oceanariums.
In the Red Sea, the water temperature is not below 21 ° C and the air is warm up to 23 ° C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea, with a location of 417 meters below sea level, is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-swimmers on the surface without any problems.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sole) and healing sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of strained nerves.
Touch the secrets of antiquity
These secrets are in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city the famous sea road, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, was run.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he had a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets, which are named after the signs of the zodiac.
Fortuna is to be found in the legend of all those who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at the photo gallery.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman era, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed today.
Watch list for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is rather not taken in euro, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekel (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekel).
In the city you are mostly by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast-track and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the subtown with the upper city.
In fact, it's an underground funicular.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays in Israel.
From Friday evening to Saturday's sunset, markets and shops are closed and public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, sea products, fish without scales and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice of different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), as well as fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-nourished cats that walk through the streets in a comfortable and uneasy way.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
On average, tickets for museums cost 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and those looking for a rest came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa waiver on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MEPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates.
Every year, 13 million host workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families that remain in their home country.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which every labour migrant must take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, over time, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become a duty for all host workers in the future.
It is necessary to put not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
The exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
This law also excludes persons who received their certificates and diplomas before the USSR was destroyed in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the examination posts will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities and more than 160 appropriate centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press several times asked the following question: what is the point of the whole thing?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the host workers?
In particular, I would like to say that it is a question of reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelew, head of the Federal Migration Authority's Representation in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before their departure.
Only organised recruitment will 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems with migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical advice.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who, under the pretext of help, put him in a dark, narrow barrack, where he will stay with dozens of his same months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home country, the One is promised to you, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be taken off and will not receive the promised pay," confirmed the head of the labour migration office of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't be shy, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to make their money in Russia admit that they are not only not able to master the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school stuff.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect in relation to the law.
The test must be carried out only by migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access prohibited for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that most of our documents are fake and we are not registered, and this will result in cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajike Umed Huschkadamov to journalists.
"Just don't be afraid of costs for false papers"
The day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants could be falsified.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for nothing: any migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be easily bought, is both public officials and civil rights activists agree.
For the moment, the public authorities can only promise that they will have time for a basic language course, which will fall through the test the first time.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered places in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
The share of legal weapons in crime is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to strengthen the arms law for private arms owners.
In doing so, the authorities respond to recent events: injured in shooting at weddings and seven dead in the amocle of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in public and increase the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the president of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovaya, and promised that the amendments to the arms law will be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws."
An open letter was published on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless smears."
The percentage of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Vasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of the registered weapons were committed in 2012 over the course of six months, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were reported for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from using the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors in Moscow, you can find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, there are illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
There were often explosions in many military camps.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition and that is why the expert reports that the weapons are being smeared under the black market, for example in Moscow.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes artisanal, as well as a mafia that organises the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service of State Statistics, criminal literature and publicly available data on arms portals.
According to the investigators, most of the illegal weapons come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
The report says that half of all weapons in the black market are there because of "the guilt of those responsible for their work with weapons."
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% come from arms production theft, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of an arms store, who does not want to be called a name, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been out of date.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the supplies in an arms camp.
A weapon, for example a TT gun, is bought through an ensign.
The gun is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police are of course aware of everything and therefore, if it cannot comply with the plan for the detection of crimes, they regularly carry out control purchases from dealers offering illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"As in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers are most often found through acquaintances with each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone came to my attention and suggested to come to the station "Behovaya," where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only found there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and date a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who has the daughter lost a tooth."
I can even come to some of the songs about a friend I trust.
He's also giving me the pussies because he knows I don't give him a shit.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemas have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "all kinds of things" were shown.
"I felt like a luxury store," the military member remembers.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try it all.
As a potential customer, I am not just buying, but I am going to the forest with the seller, and there we set a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons are offered "for different purposes."
There is no need for any papers, nor is there any personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," it says in the ad on the website "buy a gun or a gun."
There users give up your orders and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Ivan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently switched on countless fake web pages, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the net for the service.
People come like hungry fish when they feed, and then they land in Siberia, and they are allowed to make coal.
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following: The website is normally registered abroad and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through a vending machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the gun's hiding place," reported the press officer of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that at the end you can go out empty and get behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service has recently switched on countless fake web pages, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the net for the service.
"People come like hungry fish when they feed and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to make coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US Dollars
In the case of the purchase of illegal firearms, experts have shown that it is expected to have prices of between 100 and 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military arms camps by mid-range guards.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences throughout Russia decreased by 7% over the period January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail detected in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the USA, fast-food- and supermarket-workers strike
One in four US young people at some point sit behind the cash register of Mc Donald's
In the past few days, there have been massive protests against low wages in Walmart's and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
As yet, no one can predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised in a trade union way.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the US, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to a crowd of hands.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, spread branches of the chain, the target group of which are people of low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheap because the employees are paid badly.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the "Black Friday" protests called for wage increases and expressed their anger at the fact that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who deserves 9.5 US dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than they are now donating for pay.
If Walmart completely transferred the wage increases to the customers, each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be an additional expenditure of only 12.39 dollars per year for them compared to today.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that there have been protests in only nine states and that they did not bring any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in its store from 8: 00 in the evening on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total, the Walmart cash banks carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
The company's spokesperson, Dan Fogelman, in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post, claimed that "less than five" Walmart employees had completed the work and that the protest was only "another PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart branches (which are not welcome in this advanced city and therefore not yet existing), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company is selling billions of portions, and yet you are not being granted sick days, and you are not being paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At present, according to federal and New York legislation, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually increased, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive city deserves less than them.
How it's possible to get along with so little money in New York, I don't understand.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all US young people were behind the bar after school at McDonald's, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw in it the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I have always met people who complain that they can get along with this pay and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 in the morning in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
The US law forbids the management of companies to stand in the way of this goal and to warn or dismiss trade union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
The creation of trade unions in the fast food sector is difficult, however, for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high level of staff turnover.
Unsatisfied
There were strong protests that day, too, in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and yet you are not being given sick days, and you are not being paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast food staff together so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New York deserves!."
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on the ground, of whom not all are employed by the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be slightly overlisted so far"
The subject of the extended reality, which is popular with the followers of modern technologies, is usually perceived in recent times by the lens of a special glasses.
At first, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
In a conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear, however, that the glasses for the company's scientists were only a transit station.
It irritates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please give a brief description of the research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, most of humanity has remained in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user but also its environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform all the people in the world about their actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular niche.
For example, in the area of the control of objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and scarce, instead of with exiting gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But all in all, the future belongs to mixed types of control, for example, gestures and language.
- How so?
- We would ask you, for example, to give you this can?
They say it and they point it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot do at the time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors, which will make it possible to take a closer look at people's reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It is necessary to take into account not only the resolution along the X and the Y, but also the Z-axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
In our laboratory in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed a device like this, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera attachments to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that in terms of the application of the technology of the extended reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the way, but I think this is the most amazing version would be a "changing" extended reality where we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and it is their strength (private people can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality by glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no perceptible reaction!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that the extended reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactical perception.
An interesting method is the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She's doing great pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something hand-solid, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located, creates a feeling, which is at the moment still as weak as when someone was blowing over the hand-bales.
There are also tapes for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to overlist the brain?
Make it think that it can feel what it should feel when it's seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to fight with for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain is only moderately overlisted, and we still have many years ahead of us.
This is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: we are only at the beginning on many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avant-garde," which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the selected list, high-level representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene already landed, whose successes go beyond the city's borders and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is familiar with Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bearded man who is once seen at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at vernissage.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are shown, they attract great crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburger social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the Petersburger Avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, he conjures his fellow citizens a smile in the face and gives them a good mood.
Recently he took a shooting organ and became a Petersburg shooting organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artistic life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in town?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image counselors and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the Graunorm is causing aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the cultural palace of Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters came to an end then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewshina," which was the result of "Pushkinskaya 10," and then it was the end.
I am attracted to the theatre, to the fashion, to the music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all this was united in your art clinic... it was important to me to be at the centre of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the St. Petersburg Bohemian until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga."
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to the play-back, wore tight jerseys and was also one of them today's famous composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have its origin in the art clinic.
That's where our staff and regular guests went.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something.
In the year 2000 there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of our City."
I won in the category "Artist of the Year," and I was at the top of the list.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today's time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the timeliness and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition entitled "The Russian Museum as Clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and it's afraid to be like this.
In a clown, it's all covering up and losing its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone takes care of the clothes and is oriented to the outside and not to the inside of the human being.
But maybe you can't give a man your hand, but you should spit in the face.
The deception disappears through the dress-up.
We recently saw you in the role of the city's organ player, a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of the cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemian people loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But to the performances of Stas Mikhailov come several thousand!
- There are abandoned women coming to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I have painted such pictures, which were even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov with a collector.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It is said: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say, "Servants of culture."
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different for the real Tzars, because the Tzars might not understand much about culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are now good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have some who could be experts, but they are being blocked by the way, because more high-level experts are needed to properly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters therefore have to find other museums.
- What about Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
It's hard to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, because we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's a lot less for us.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with strawberry people on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least live in hypothetically.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at a high level or in the orbit of Venus, in other words in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Experiments with plants have already been carried out half a century before.
The fourth generation of the peas grown in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It was followed by the production of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to explore the effect of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
A normal chick is developing.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find a stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and begin to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a fixed underground, the chicks were overtaken wildly.
Ten hours later, the neonates' instincts were completely blunt off.
The chicks didn't respond to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chicks hatch and then set it up because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev notes for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only the same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion."
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatelites, but once again it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats got young.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
In contrast to animals, man could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: is it going to survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female Cosmonautin, Valentina Tereshkova, bore a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also Cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Sketlana Sawizkaya, who was in orbit twice and even worked outside the space vehicle, bore a son.
But there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights to orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolab in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of suspension, the Cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyander were to bear witness to the fact that life on the land was coming out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly for about 9 months in the fruit water, and that it can then become more easily used to water.
In principle, this is logical, as from birth until the first swimming only two weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenova.
So while for a newborn child the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman does not get without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are rapidly retreating and thus also the ability to push the child out decreases.
All right, let's do this through birth-opening tools.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to push the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the Earth's attraction, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in the orbit like an adult for training in a stress suit.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to give birth to a disabled person, a completely unadapted person," says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
But at some point it becomes a reality when the people of the earthquake in their spaceships break into a distant planet that becomes the home for their descendants born in space.
NKthe-Chef: Control of the black system fails due to the fault of the policy
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in the context of public contracts, but falls back on its application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontroní úřad, NKů), Miloslav Kala, says this.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result seems to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he refers to Prime Minister Petr Nečas's attitude to the so-called "black system."
The Prime Minister has recently said that the ODS would not be harassing the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the government president to come and the control office whose duty is to control compliance with the law," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies' Control Committee, you discussed a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was it about?
This is a parallel test, which we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a matter of the European legislative system which determines how public procurement is to be handled, and that is what national legislation is based on, and finally, there is the real practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have been able to see very interesting differences. In general, the laws of us may even be something "more stringent and perfect," but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep laying down new and more precise rules, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results for you from this project?
In particular, such joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and to reduce and eradicate thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of threshold values for contracts does not guarantee that we will also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we are only burdening the system with excessive "paperwork," and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to use the system than if the thresholds were higher.
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NKτ here, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college, which is only formed slightly differently, but in principle both authorities work in a similar way.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, that is to say, that there are these offices in the individual Länder - in this the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which is our state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the national accounting offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, in some respects, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the examiners are better there?
I am sure not, but as I said, I do not like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything to do with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the importance for your authority of the revision of the procurement law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an impact on our tests.
As our controls take place retrospectively, we have to expect a certain delay.
So far, we have had more impact in the preparation phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of inefficiency" and have examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here, of course, the changes will have an impact as the thresholds, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, including:
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system being burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be respected.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are already accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the procurement law is equivalent to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But is it then useful to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
Let us say first of all, which is not the way forward.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not be a problem for entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the President of the Government to come and to hinder the control office whose duty is to control compliance with the law.
He can say, "We change the law and we allow it," but he can't say that we're pretending to be nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the tenderer with the best offer is excluded only due to formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we are missing.
On the streets there is some ice-cream, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic, there is some snow and ice smoothness.
However, the roads are mainly well-accessible, and sometimes there is a need for increased caution.
Karlovy bath
In the district of Karlovy the streets were well accessible this morning, with some snow and ice-cream.
The temperatures decreased to -5 to -10 ° C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes there is only a thin snow ceiling.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the crest of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to Nebel.
The R6 motorway and the first-class road routes in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes long and smooth.
All second and third-class road routes, including mountain roads, can also be used.
On these roads, however, there are some of the snow-rusted or out-of-the-line snow-rust.
There is therefore a need for increased attention, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some of the streets of East Bohemia there is danger of ice-cream, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes an extended snow layer on the streets, the road and motorway directorate is informed on its website.
The street championships warn drivers of ice-cream, which can occur especially in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
It can be found in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
An extended snow layer is located on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is today mostly sunny or cheerful and it remains largely low-rainfall-free.
The temperatures are between -3 and + 1 ° C, a weak wind is blowing.
Pilsen district
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now well accessible, but local attention is needed and the driving is to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it was snowing before and the temperatures then fell, ice-cream can occur on the streets.
In addition, local fog is expected, but the view will improve during the day.
This information is from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but the road championships recommend increased attention between the 80. and the 131. km.
The first road-class roads are mainly dry but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice-cream can occur in part.
The second and third-class road paths are moist, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections is also valid.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the area of the Bohemian Forest.
Olomouc District
Today, we have to expect a snowbag for drivers who are heading towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of stray vehicles, Schneematsch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
The road championships were forced to use the night snow, and in the district of Šumperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the trams are usually fully accessible.
"In the district of Šumperk still snow remains in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect to have a snowbreak in the direction of Jeseník, "said an employee of the road administration Šumperk today to the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník County also had to get out at night, according to their information the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers have to be careful in the forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In North Bohemia, the street championships report several poorly accessible sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice-cream, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district Ústí n.K. is closed according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain in lower locations below zero, so that snow and ice will be kept on the streets. However, there are no problems reported from the deep plains, especially south-east of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic problems have been reported so far.
In particular, ice-cream is reported from the area of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this during the night - during the day rain and melting snow, during the night cloudless sky and frost.
The main lines and the road I / 13 on the border of the districts of Ústí n. L. and Liberec report poor traffic conditions.
The lock of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches that were pressed from the snow elast to the road.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy on our concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports we people like to start on.
With our band The Tap Tap we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a country-wide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which is forecast for December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will be held at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 9: 00.
The end of the concerts is to be about the time that the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally of me, then we developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we would not only like to collect enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we would also like to think together with the public about the state in which we once hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key holders against the end of the world, with which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap also recorded the so-called hymn against the end of the world with the title "The end of the world" together with other performers.
Already today the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and that the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung at the same time by all the performers on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live by Czech television in a direct connection.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, in which we have been working for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supported by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be created, to which we will then move in with this project.
There are several groups and performers at each concert.
What criteria did you choose them for?
We wanted to put together a program that would address all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, there are Chinaski, support of Lesbians, illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to be in the Czech House in New York, and I would like to be personally - if we are in the United States - to be able to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips in a logistical and organisational way?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. Furthermore, of course, we have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of how it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we do with us, we were just in Russia witnessing that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for disabled people. It is still unusual there when someone is in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even a matter of course there that you let a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're after...
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation is still dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with serious disabilities to move independently in public space, to go to the museum, to use toilets, etc.
But it is not very common for a larger group of disabled people to be actively involved in the social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a maintainer at the Jedlička Institute, where I met a lot of young people who were interested in getting involved in something intense.
And since I am a musician and play saxophone, among other things, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
And over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, used to say, something has come out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if one does something and does not see it outside, one's performance in a certain sense does not exist.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning, I have felt the potential that things can be addressed differently.
In show business, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is considered with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the viewer has most of the time is, of course, pity; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we must regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only progress for themselves, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you can hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you cannot compromise in many things and you must also call for a certain discipline.
I think, however, that is quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have rehearsal twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm of many quickly disappears.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them have been present since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Just one: Láďa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Find the day before the forecast end of the world, Thursday, 20 / 12 / 2012 at 21: 00
The venues are: Inchaba-Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected to each other by live-circuit and a common interpretation of the hymn "Weltverdend is coming out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide the funds for the provision of a multi-functional educational centre for the disabled to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The entrance fee is CZK 400, children up to 12 years of age free of charge, tickets are available on advance sale at Bohemiticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the Space Agency at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the European Space Agency's member countries, the second member of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the following years took part in several ESA projects.
The path of Poland to space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos were concerned with space, with which they did not always have an understanding.
I would like to remind you of the presentation by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics."
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Entrance to the Cosmonautics."
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognised contribution to the development of space was, among other things, appreciated by the name of one of the craters on the ground side of the moon after him.
As early as 1925, a railway-Draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project were unfortunately not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the dragons.
The information on this is from the contemporary press only.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research was carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents that the research had advanced to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 the technical press of the design of a photo-electric hunting dragon by Ing. Rohzoński showed up, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda poweitrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects were concerned with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Other articles on space were published in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problem, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space society.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be expected that the exploration of space would have a future.
As early as its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA made an effort to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), was Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the highly successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first started on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not entirely 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 in the Błędów desert, flight tests began with the two-stage RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a height of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high-speed winches.
In 1962, however, the further development was stopped.
The first RM-type missile was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height for all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed in the aviation institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit work.
This decision created a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, full movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
The large differences in the value of labour (wages) result in price margins.
This term is a state in which the manufacturer tries to compete in economic competition by importing cheap goods by "underselling" the competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or to buy it at a low price, or to give up their business, and the result is high unemployment in countries with a comparable high labour cost.
As private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus to replace the social and economic damage they cause.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force one's own population to accept the dictate of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic constraints on long-term unemployment and, on the other, by the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food outlets for poor people for some years now, who are no longer able to feed through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU-South countries will undoubtedly be the same as those in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in their social level, or to pay for a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
The question is, of course, where does this capital come from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty is migrated from one country to another; or capital is left out of it, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy and that the planning economy leads to the economic disaster.
Private capital is very close to its position that the state must not intervene in the economy in a direct way.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent lobby, which is omnipresent in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual recognition, of legislation in which virtually everything is trivial, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a Ministry of State, in the absence of finance, is responsible for the drafting of draft laws by private legal companies, which are closely linked to industry.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions say, but from strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
It is clear that the liberal democracies are now quickly in a situation as described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has been in disintegration for a long time, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against bribe, by unlegal embezzling of benefits or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew unobtrusively, and the people went to the election with already bought voices... "" People with character did not apply for office, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decline... "" The only medicine in this difficult situation was really to speak of being a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected... "Appian thought of Pompey, but the strong man was then Caesar, who replaced democracy for the long time by the sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as well as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is, by its very nature, not in a position to recognize and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who do not in the least seek deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state, the fall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already taking place.
In particular, the fact that today's elites are in complete ignorance of the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are already witnesses today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and newer history.
The abolition of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the public's influence on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
... "that nothing is born of violence, or could ever be born," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is:... "so that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want a war, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schniper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians a terrorist; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel a terrorist.
I do not want to write here about who in these ever-recurring waves of killing guilty and who is victims; in the end, the present-day inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence itself.
It is my aim to open the eyes of the readers behind the scenes, the view of whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot of land in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and come out of my own understanding of who or which group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always those personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not been created within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one especially stands out, which one could call the head of the octopus (I do not know if there is anyone else above them, but I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
There is not much written about them.
I understand.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s in order to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the consolidation of their power, the increase of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are fighting or preparing for wars (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi, only four left, with Russia in the meantime under the control of its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to face this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue own (i.e. state) banknotes during the Civil War and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the Member of Parliament Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The global power of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859-1871 to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was intended to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, and the second war was intended to break the colonial rule of Britain in particular, and the third war was intended to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would provide their amenities and their luxury and would not use so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the pre-war) and ultimately lead to the adoption of absolute power.
The method used by the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top is to trigger a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see FED's foundation, so that crises such as those which they caused in 1907 do not repeat).
After the murder of the Habsburg heir Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they succeeded in triggering the First World War, and destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economic unsubstantiated surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the opening of the Second World War, the bankers had a latent conflict situation created by politics, by using gigantic war repairs to Germany; they created the condition of poor masses, so that they only had to subdue the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who called the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take on the function of a fifth column, and also took on the role of a fifth column, in order to ignite the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was now getting rid of the chain on which the international bankers had held it, or whether everything was going according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the land for the Second World War was prepared by the war repairs against Germany, the proclamation of the State of Israel is the creation of a focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people, like in the Second World War, will be the victims of the first line of battle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just remember how strongly people divide into Israel's followers and opponents).
Who is the guilty one and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are only voting for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal-to-international-banker, who is doing all it can to start a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership of the Shanghai Organization of Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could soon be a global conflict, which could be destroyed by Iran's control of the only 2-mile-wide road of Hormus, which is running over 20% of the world's oil supplies.
In what light the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-round crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its idea, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth in order to subdue this being to total control.
"And it is that the little ones and the big ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the mark, the name of the animal, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! He who has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-four. "
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they called for the delivery of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronage of his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the call of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to release the hostages made everything worse.
The diplomats who were captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home created a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the US a small partial victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff were able to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by the Exfiltration expert, Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in professional journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie," that is, the story of a successful humour-piece, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the levels of mood change in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the looser passages from Hollywood, which come ironic and slightly overpointed.
And then there are the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the Crimean No Children's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film, which does not play in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the entry sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet it still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film stick on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
But with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality a little - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a telephone call in America, or even the persecution on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much of action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film is thus losing some of the pull force. It is a film that you can track with some interest, while gouging the design and the retro-style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70's.
However, it is difficult for him to arouse enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive in a certain way and as a proof of how excessive the ideas of the omnipotent and all-knowing secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the inflation of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls a survey every year on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to hold the competition "Absurmost regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"This was the idea that the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% women's rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
For example, the European Court of Justice's judgment on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women is among the nominees.
In the meantime, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively less risk to insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
One of the controversial EU regulations is the binding incorporation of bioethanol into fuels which, as a result, is naturally harmful, and the ban on reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount of this risk, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also gained from the actual ban on the use of the term "butter spread 'or the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that trade and industry lobby, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly."
The European Commission has defended itself in the argument that it only harmonises the different national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be indicated on sale that children under eight years of age must not blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU called for an American study, which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of children's suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market flows.
Curious ideas are also available at home
It is also relatively absurd to have a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated the above-mentioned absurdities as well as the EU regulation on the level of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The survey's organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having the sea, or the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, of course, were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU, "said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state camps were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, according to Palas, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic to the extent that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered funding for applications for funding to the municipalities, in particular the funds for the setting up of grants to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations in the Member States are easily targeted at criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition, in the opinion of some experts.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing at all in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced in the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this country also cause the fact that, similar to other Member States in Brussels, the Czech Republic has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the national area (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename the name "Tuzemák."
The name rum may only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmachchen now also the Karlovy-Bader Zunback, Carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer rolls can grow.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how do you get the idea of running for the President's office?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything in our country were to work without any problems, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic being looted for 20 years, the way thieves run free, while people are being increased in taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I am over 40, independent and non-partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then you got on your way to the castle.
Don't you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself that I will take up the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later on, I have specified this and said that I will be running for the President's office if I am elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that as a people, we are in the pub and in front of the TV, but we are putting down anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media who want to rob you of the honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
I was said, for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The battle for the castle has taken place with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive statements of assets of over 20 million crowns.
You need to change laws for that.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How are you going to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have been working to ensure that the guide remains a free trade, and this has been achieved.
The problem is the petty-spiritual policy - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party-less person, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without a drawer and a party dogma.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather on the right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It's important to me that we move on.
It is not for me whether one belongs to the left or to the right; I want to connect people.
I am always in public support of any good approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
It can be called populism because of me, but all the proposals I have been talking about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you have only a few words.
And you can't get far in the long term with that in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to people for long enough, will you be able to enforce, for example, material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally impose material and criminal liability on politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the speakers would have to say, if necessary, why they refuse.
A strong personality who points to maladministration can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it does not work, I will return to the private sector in six years' time.
That sounds a little like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I cannot reach anything on my own; that is why I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they would like to run for the Senate as well.
I have, for example, spoken to Radim Jančura, who, however, refused because of overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud of trading light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of the voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who have gone mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of the mayors and district captains.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I have not yet thought about this, because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, nor have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only CZK 20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, what would you look like?
My private assets are estimated at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million, and then I have a few million in the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a children's dream - I always liked James Bond as he was driving in the car, being galant to women and fighting against evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program is not very interested.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my senator's salary.
But I could not live from the senator's salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son the English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your money?
Didn't you say you were going back to these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially retreated my activities.
For example, in the spring, my deputy will become the managing director of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would completely cease my activities.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday issue of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - with the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built library - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says, "Yes, it is beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's going into one of those old-style libraries on a voluntary basis today, is it?
Spijkenisse, a city in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitants of the municipality have the lowest education rate in the whole Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid fact, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build the seven fictional bridges presented on the euro as a pretty-pained steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library must be here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of the daring bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the thing with a common serenity and appeared in 2003 for the competition hearing anno with five books under the arm and a grin on the face.
And while the jury was still in the dark, looking around and twitching with the armpits, the naughty Maas stacked his fine-for-the-size carpenters into a pyramid and ended his actionfully supported speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is it, my proposal for the library of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is covered.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small town town, which so far had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to think of a dairy factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public culture in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Book's dorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain, but the true joy of space and reading opens up when the topography climbs on foot.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lights clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You're already looking for parking bench, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"The bookshelves usually stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have turned the classic room configuration upside down and the reading area was flouted from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the library is well used: offices, internet library, chess club, environmental centre and house technology centre are located in the middle.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are once wall-covering, once brooding, once boot-railing.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even tiled architects and civil engineers shake their heads whether the unknown building material is.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so one day, in a Friesland farm, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in the Netherlands, in greenhouses and in fields, a multimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two seasons, then it is ripe for the waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is discoloured into a dark, homogeneous, load-able material that smells a bit of new car and a bit of sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre long hike, the literary café is not only rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and topped ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the library mountain is under a glass crash, the sun itself on sunny days only seems short into the interior.
The wide wooden glands, which are located across the glass facade, serve as a shading and intercept a large part of the solar radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest will be done by fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptical from the IT industry, already dared the way into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg a spy "long overdue soul."
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his own personal collection.
The aim is to fill the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - which is not yet fully equipped.
The concept has come to an end.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decorating.
With this, MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline that is called in the trade jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a point of departure for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the reception of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first signalled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is turning its foreign policy into a German foreign policy, away from a policy that, as it were, was managed by the US.
It is also difficult to see that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still working on their role, but they are on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an impact on the attitude of the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to push the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
It definitely matters.
But I wouldn't want to put too much weight on it either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not believe that this was as dramatic a break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly been in favour of a veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government has a lot of understanding of the European position in secret.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so bright about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a broader line, and instead they have to drive things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, even because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still difficult to lead?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti-German feelings become free.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be receptive to a wide range of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European policy is steadily decreasing, but at the moment the EU is filling this vacuum, who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and make it much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is where a name is officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it has been protected for as long as the actual namesake does not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in security violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
A few additional letters are already enough for the imitators to register their brands.
So from Gucci you just get Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny entered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the Beijing Trade Mark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that also used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injured intellectual property is known.
In the large cities there are several-story department stores that sell almost exclusively forgeries.
But Pattloch's cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he is against the fact that Chinese companies are officially given the right of the Trademark Office to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
It means women fishing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is watered down, the sole position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the process costs of the sectors concerned go into the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
But the deletion of dubious entries in the brand register is hard to reach and go into the money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court dismissed actions because after the long duration of the name in question had become "market reality."
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiator money because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are allowed to use an emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was closed, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there had been bottlenecks in 2010 due to insufficient staff and room equipment.
In the past year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the process to normality."
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 objections are still waiting for the office to be completed.
It costs a lot to deal with
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new notifications all over the world for the tenth time in a row, the Authority informs.
This was also true for the existence of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, a fee of 1.8 billion yuan had been paid.
This means that every registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euro.
It costs a number of times, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
The Germans were able to achieve that their illegal production of imitated car parts was lifted.
But the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the brand Freudenberg.
One had failed to do so, because in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark office also rejected the Munich opposition.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the party to the trial continues to fight today.
You have to watch out for hell
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, and the company's archive had to look through even one hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement in vain.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even going back to Europe.
That is, when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long been abandoned by the Group, yet it has been able to stop the registration.
"You have to watch the hell out," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, but rather the foreigners should "register everything that is worth protecting in China, too," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was in the last act of his brand drama, then you would have to pay the other side royalties for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir is rehearsing Imbongi - and in Swaziland, Aidsfaisen is happy about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometres.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's lippers are looking for the bar on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - Alt, Bass, Tenor and Sopran - slowly swell, beguile and follow each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his supple wild gestures.
It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV infected worldwide, which is estimated by Unaids, the United Nations programme for the control of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in the south of Africa.
= = References = = = = External links = =
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidsfaisen in the village of Esitjeni, the Association Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euro per month you can sponsor.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means a story teller on Zulu or also a lobster.
The bantu language can speak fluently in this room no one can, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this strange soft language and is taking them back to where they originally come from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8 733 km of the crow from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they have been killed by the HI virus.
In Esitjeni there is little evidence of all Swaziland's disease: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying at the middle of the thirty is not a rarity.
During a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school degree, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to give him a warm meal a day.
But a year later the choir founded the club "Voices for Africa," which since then almost professionally takes care of the Aids orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhoea).
Common viral STI are HIV, human pappilomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scratches are among the parasitic STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and Tripper are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (fungus), trippers and human pappilomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low - yet: around 20 percent of the new HIV infections are in this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common in adolescents than in other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human pappilomavirus are common in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to notification.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
There were about 2700 cases in 2011.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases may cause genital ulcers, urination, discharge, abdominal pain, and bubbles or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because in some cases, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular studies, especially in the case of frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STI can be cured and late sequences can be avoided.
A lot of things come together through the sponsorship, donations and, not least, the gages that the choir is singing all over Germany.
"In total, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and strong woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans stay well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
Those who have no one left will come to the shelter at Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cookers who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had a HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because, as obvious as the disease is in the whole country, it is the best to keep it dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
It's actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through the South of Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of weariness, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-confidence, many of which are still familiar at the southern tip of the black continent from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also has already defied some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," the people say there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, the 8733 km of the crow, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal room on the Bergheim Straße, you can see it shining.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice ceiling may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water there, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" magazine.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice ceiling in the permanently in the shadow region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that have been hit on the Mercury.
No one is related to the finding of ice but to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the finds could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are about to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to the earth: small peacocks in infinite widths.
The picture comes from a camera that German researchers from the Max Planck Institute have developed.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who is circling the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: the oldest stars are to be seen as blue points, the pink-colored "newborn" in the star-kreaal are more difficult to identify.
This star-forming region - called by scientists unromantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star image Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has recorded the snitch telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star has thrown out in the death process.
In the huge trifide nebula, 5400 light-years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birth room.
The Plejade cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
The Helix mist looks like a red age on this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His resemblance to an earthly continent gave this mist the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular colour.
In its full beauty, this baby can only be recorded by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these have been created is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace of 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest pictures of the Hubble-Telescope: The Hot tub galaxy
Depending on the colour, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light-years away Trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-divided, three-divided), as dark dusty strips share the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have taken pictures of the precursors of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are racing to each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not have technical abbreviations may call them by their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a section of the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away nebula consists of dust particles, which are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is called the UGC 1810.
In this star ennebel is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new Youngsters.
Also this star cloud, connected to the rosette nebula, is constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only created shortly after the Big Bang when hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lippehry in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been growing - and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope was the largest telescope in the world at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space equally over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the height angle.
Its special feature: the high light-collecting force.
In fact, despite the relatively low diameter of the mirror, this is enough to reach that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Ascibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to the space after alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be composed of 42 meters - and made up of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes were considered the largest in the world on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which next to them still looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is also to be created on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the space telescope Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990 it has already provided pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly those that can be inhabited.
On 2 February 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture the last start preparations are documented at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is being launched on board an Ariane5 missile in 2018.
The primary level of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the big bang.
Scientists assume that the south pole of Mercury also has ice.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
For decades, radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
The scientists now have certainty through the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 - the first one that is around Mercury.
Drink butter daily - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for tracks in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for tracks in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is called wild-romantic.
The small bus is rumbling over the curvature road, past the densely wooded hills, ripping rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian people of the Talyans live, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very long-lived.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town is protesting with too well-balanced architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-lane.
The great wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area documented, the older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child is still born
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented person, who became 122 years old, Müsluom's age seems to be very doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he had another daughter.
So, has Şirali Müslumov calculated his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-age people in Central Asia.
"There are also a striking number of high-age people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation, there is no scientific evidence of age, especially as there were no register of persons.
Fused butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many high-age people live here in the south?
The Arian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is due to the diet.
But that the calorie food of the Talyans should be so healthy that they love meat, bread and, above all, milk products, and many of them drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem to be very plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cenmiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that she tirelessly rolls up and over.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both of whom are long-standing grandparents.
Two young children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you can prepare the guests with tea, which is served in the typical, tree-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in a row and in a link, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde pots, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She only ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven't bought food in the supermarket once.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything got better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the rudder.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, who is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the oar.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old people.
230 Manat (about the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son, who was born long ago, is right: "The old people enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as a base is strongly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For all of them, so far hopelessly disbanded in a contentious opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of the grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, Mohammed Morsi said, almost apologizing, had temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended its powers "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about that are the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
Should the Judicative be dismayed?
In fact, the 234 articles that were whipped by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constitutional Assembly in a night-long, 15-hour parforcer are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the sponge formulation and the legal scope that it entails for a more stringent interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least a new article: in all the matters concerning Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be moved to the country's most important Islamic institution, with great radiance, in all Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the spirit oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the degeneration of the judiciary.
There is a great deal of interpretation in the draft Constitution.
It is also a problem: the civil military court should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, it says in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote their morality and values."
This is so disoriented in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this, another forbade the Prophet Mohammed and his messengers from offending or slander.
But what is an insult, and how it shall be punished, remains unclear.
The words "insulting people" are also said to be forbidden.
Is there a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
The question of interpretation, like so much in the draft that Mursi has to sign and will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum, according to his words "very soon."
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the Charter even before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place candidate for the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said that the draft Constitution belongs to "the waste mountain of history."
Via Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis of trying to "coup against democracy."
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, made it a counter-demonstration, but not in the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile bank in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafists' followers took part in it and called, "The people call for the application of God's law."
They asked of Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, in which everything began, would have waged up civil war-like conditions.
That's obviously not what Mursi's followers wanted to risk.
The Muslim brothers said that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide in the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered to be safe.
"The word human rights does not even happen"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone by February and involved all the social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in the conversation with the "world on Sunday."
Mursi's expansion of power to all three forces in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto overcomes it," laments Saeda.
But without civil society organisations a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who is looking at the ideological campaign of direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A protestor on the Tahrir warns, "You are feeding a monster you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most evil-smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty bad-smelling fish?
You take a selection of over-ripe cheeses.
You place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sports clothes.
And leave them there for a week.
This is how you have to imagine the nasal-deafening smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a trout with salt, which is fermented into water for up to a year, depending on how stinkingly you would like to have your fish.
When the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flow to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very bribery specialty.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as the so-called "Rakfisk-General" also organizes the festival.
People around us eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit drink can displace the smell.
I'll have a few pies.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a quite long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was soaked in air-tight salt water barrels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and - without doubt under the use of alcohol-damped senses - consumed.
Even before one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the USA.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was much richer than Norway not too long ago, flows immigrants.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important - an essential, though strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But in fact everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often make it into the world press, and most people do not seem to mind.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, you only refer to the "incident of July 22."
It is difficult for Norwegians to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries has been the main responsibility for the current wealth of Norway since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the piercing blue eyes.
We are a prudent people, as they say.
Your English is just like most people here impeccable.
We're not very spooky, we don't like boasting.
Norway has been very careful about its oil supply - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years up to the world economic crisis, all the money they did not have was thrown at them, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," she adds with untroubled laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I have enough of Rakfisk.
A moose burger like that is definitely something else.
But in the evening, the stinkfish is on the menu.
The hotel where I am located is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-dressed showmaster surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict mist of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is on the verge of a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, Will Grant of the BBC is analysing the challenges and mixed feelings of his people.
At the moment, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which closed several important road routes to the capital and caused chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will be the president's bindings and will take over the leadership of the nation.
It is a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week to US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before going on an eye-level with the President of the United States, Pena Nieto served as the governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
The inhabitants of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the fractured, bumpy streets that once existed here.
Plackets with its name are also located outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a Congressman for the Pena Nieto party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside of the President's Palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the allegations of the opposition, the new president's lack of substance.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He was an excellent statesman, but above all he was also someone who could listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under highway transfers and in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was deployed to combat the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a stain of brachland near a large landfill.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even surpassed that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for their violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nieto believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of women's murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government had closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete construction, typical of the downfall district, Irinea Buendia is fighting with the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already in use.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied it so far.
The authorities treated me like I was a sister-in-law, a troublemaker, a nungler.
They want you to just accept your judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many formal errors and failures," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the President's Binding on Saturday, he is also taking on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the last six years, and the new President has promised to take particular care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is as he was as Governor," says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
The prosecution claims that Bradley Manning has not complained of abuse
The prosecutor's office contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he has been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence is seeking a rejection of the indictment on the grounds of too hard conditions of detention
The Free US Army is accused of extracting thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor's office tried on Friday to establish that the army-run Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in US history - failed to complain about the alleged abuse in military custody.
In a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents on weekly visits to prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention period in Quantico, Virginia did not have any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to dismiss the charge - Manning had already been punished enough by the hard detention period - Manning had declared that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then released by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled in after their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had been in increased detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional."
The forms, said Fein, did not contain any complaints about abuse, even though the officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they should deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after discussion of the concerns)" No problems, "and that did not necessarily mean that I said nothing at all," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months before.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status for "prevention of injuries."
The military said it assigned this restrictive status - one level under the risk of suicide - to him and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was well and to get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning announced his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for about two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marines Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered the suicide in Kuwait and had become unconscious because of the heat.
Not to be allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was burdensome.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he was trying to keep moving, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that came into his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn't see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Manning.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning about an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning had said that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling during this count.
At the Friday interview, Manning said that he had closed a command from his guard that he should have dropped the ceiling with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was no danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the covenant of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and reduce his level of detention drastically if he is to be sentenced to the military court at his trial, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will claim guilty of lower crimes, while other charges, which are considered too extreme, will be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend, and the public prosecutor is expected to justify the conditions of arrest.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been held in accordance with the rules applicable to all prisoners held under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the illegal publication of secret information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all counts, he is in danger of a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass control, when there was a lot of craziness in me.
Shields referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of where I was supposed to go.
I grew up in Central California and I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian."
Later I chose "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for any shortcuts or hyphen.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to maintain myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I do not get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week, when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason why Mexicans are now as likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He would like to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc, as the European Union has done.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not give any details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership under a pre-held rifle to give them more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So, as soon as a US government official even has a mild criticism of Mexico, we hear complaints - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how the Americans are harassing the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the path of war.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico is in fact the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or a large parent - was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our fidelity is for them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now have lived the American dream, attended good schools and got good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the case with the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't be caught behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who, when she was a child, legally emigrated to the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans do not like them.
While she is a US citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are neither one nor the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to re-establish their links with the Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to step up its ties with Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to choke such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocation, countless buildings were put in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have taken place near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this confusion.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly situation of the plunder could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first sight, optimism, given the current situation, seems far from appropriate.
Even if the truce agreed on November 21 continues, this week's struggles have strengthened the hard-ass on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its group itself had to face great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being dragged into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a reawakening, regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken over for the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Shining Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist half-moon is being formed around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist embossing may stand before the fall of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most populous and most important Arab country by far - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the region's balance in a sustainable way.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome," has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is unshakingly holding on to its position. Many European countries have held Hamas responsible for the latest scale of violence.
Israel has been well done in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockages that go into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal of international law, but are being further developed.
Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party joined an even more militant group in the run-up to the elections on January 22 under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these hideous Palestinians also pampered and left their own state to them?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, would they not fire missiles, just like their colleagues in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab spring could make a line on them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defence budget of Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Mursi is meeting with Barack Obama to achieve a truce could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking bold steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still being deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus in Tel Aviv exploded this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Bloody missions to push Hamas back in the Gaza Strip will increasingly call for their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The right answer is that which is represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel is leaving for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give more influence to outsiders to the implementation of this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop the supply of arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by the exchange of territories and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also help to move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems as if he is also disinclined to participate.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs equal to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with dramatic pictures showing sick body parts and children who are infected with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small writing, is from the coming Saturday.
In this way, Australia is introducing the world's most stringent tobacco packaging regulations.
The Australian government wants to remove young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is starting from studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will not start smoking at 99%.
"One can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that the tobacco companies are trying to apply their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have, for example, shown that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of the multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour the trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian forgers will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette etuis and silicone covers to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago in the Supreme Court of Australia with their challenge to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale operations and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the gap in the popularity of social media lies in exactly the population to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibited them from acting as sports sponsors and forced most traders to no longer interpret cigarettes in shops. Now, tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to apply for their products do not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports on brands written by "ordinary people."
You have to ask yourself the question: is this just a private person who enjoys Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even take a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries is in major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to require photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves to be defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a tilt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box where a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
To be honest, there's only one reason I'd stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill up its shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said all right, that's it, we're closing down," he adds, obviously, blackmailed.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored even once
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane was out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get bored.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight for half a day at the airport is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This will force the brain to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today almost constantly stare at the one or the other screen, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this.
"In fact, boredom has a very long story," he says.
The house walls of Pompey adorns a Latin graffiti over boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to carry out a satisfactory activity but not being able to do so."
Boredom is different from apathy as a result of the fact that the person is not busy but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there was no need to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists of "a disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing."
Boredom can sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two states may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Uncommitted Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attitude" - in German, for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom under the Aspect of Attention," published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science," Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not even hear these sounds.
The people who heard the hardly audible television said they had more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could find no reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When one tries to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you do a single-tone activity - "like the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that tattles and scratches, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hum around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a roaring speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of long-term vulnerability" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys become more boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty strained bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and her parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found out that 32% of the young people in school and doing their homework were bored, while 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentage of boredom has increased or fallen.
He was sure, however, that "young people are perceived as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their daily lives.
So back to my question of origin: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and to fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - that's what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that something else should be done," said Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
But television can cause short-term happiness, but it is a long-term fugitive.
So if you pass an iPad to your bored child, you can get it away from boredom, but it has not learned to talk or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transmits from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should be celebrating boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to feel at ease, even from the point of view of constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be boring more often, but boredom is the painful, inexorable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to shut down and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to get involved once the noise is silent."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the south-east of Colorados for an offence in court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few marijuana dragons and a pipe with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a day of September by car in Lamar near the Kansas border when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug equipment - cavalier crimes, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he one, too?
In the uncertain weeks after the State's decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offences is less dependent on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misconduct that revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 for small-scale ownership, which is allowed by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana-adelicts and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Chief of Police in Aurora, which is east of Denver.
And even regulators in the state of Washington are scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is considered that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of regulation of marijuana, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for own use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the State of Washington's Spiritual Drink Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be resolved during this time - for example, how the state requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the conurbation of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the "Center for Legal Cannabis," a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his employees in Aurora, in which he said that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana names in persons over 21 years of age and that the police would not seek "immediately" criminal evidence of these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban rules for the regulation of the farmers of medical marijuana and would continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in the north of Colorados, district attorney Ken Buck has a stronger view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
At present 119 people have to be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged for other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer displays adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado's voters supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of the government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state have brought to light a profound discord among local officials in view of the great green experiment.
District state lawyers are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the accused for marijuana acts in court and acts on the ground as a spokesperson for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for still not being able to accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national model cases for the legalisation of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also waiting for instructions from the Federal Government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
The advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several high-profile arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama government, believes that, although criminal officials will probably not enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they will probably be reluctant to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Before the election day, some local municipal authorities approved Moratoria for new marijuana business, although it could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this change of law.
We depend on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
There are still many questions to be answered.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only today's university students are being attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought was the world's greatest knowledge stamp, a modern Greek symposion that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had again packed my suitcases and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with the fact that college students had sex in the next room.
The author A N Wilson said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink out of damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, I was running because I was suffering from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason that seemed to be so narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been an important advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was in favour of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, recent reports show that a new generation of moderate right-wing students are suffering similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred for Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them called for the same level of equal rights protection that benefits gay, disabled and ethnic minorities last week.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable because of their political views."
They call for a place in the equality committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was aggravated by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," which was Tories as an eccentric and neonazis.
It was shown, among other things, by the graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who was driving in a Rolls-Royce and protesting with silver-coloured suit and silver-filled walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-designate of the conservative student association of Oxford, says that she has observed a growing opposition to students of the moderate right among JCR members.
"This is a danger to the intellectual discourse and the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of this kind.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted in favour of not giving Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title due to reductions in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even spooked Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, in which new students meet each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even took part with joy.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wooden spaces of the tutor.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I was not prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a pitcher, and pretty hateful.
"Do Thatcher's followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students gifted.
In my eyes, tears were raging.
"I suggest that you take some French lessons in your free time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting in college alone at dinner, when someone was typing on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who imagined himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being stranded.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the first term Tory pretend to be a member of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to change later.
I insisted that I did not agree on all points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A start-up in philosophy, politics and business, who had ironically attended the Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tory have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that lay before me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of respect and isolation.
The only tutor to be openly recognized as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-scale and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he received a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed to be disbelieving.
During his time in the '40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do anything like that, not in my city of the dreamlike towers.
Even my Communist friends have always shown perfect manners.
His wet eyes were clouding.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
My emotional resistance was weakened by my frequent trips to London.
One of my male friends, also Tory's followers, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorium the following week, in which another storytutor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was in secret from shame, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "old fools."
The relief only lasted for a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my butchers gave up.
When they left, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a weeping sloppy dick.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Minister, but is still hiding behind an unearned call for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture," which was opened this week in London, ABC will talk to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian fashion-maker customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of the accommodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture," a great retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture dresses have been put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signor" Garavani, which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on display until 3 March, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be at a disadvantage.
"At least they don't go out on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began their career at the week of the Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of the origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was turned into a glorious and 60-metre-long catwalk, which proposes a roll-out: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti was wearing in "La Notte," or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names like the one of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg radiate.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leaders in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she was wearing a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamt of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s it finally came to this.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honors its name.
"It was a dream that came true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses "with absolute care" because "a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it."
The "King" of Fashion
The big final of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazzze" (as the fashion man called his seamen) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half-metre long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society."
For years with the "Savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as much honor as any of his clients' husbands.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his peace, his well-kept and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their lives by bringing sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this end, he must rise every day down to the ground of his crater, where the gas from the earth is in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kg in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent in the turtle's tempo, while they have to keep the balance and take their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives as it happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The mining workers of Kawah Ijen deserve 5 Eurocent for each kilo of sulphur they're cutting.
At the top, they train the way between the tourists, who take pictures like circus monkeys and run with the tiresome baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mine company has placed a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has taken advantage of the deposits in the volcano and (never better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually wear 70 kg, we get about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely completed, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 Euro) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such a seemingly inhumane effort is, however, the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the mine workers here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for a reason that is as important as the sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduists, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at risk for three years at the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated from the volcano because of the toxic gases.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I will work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-stricken young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrying.
He shares a dirty wooden cottage with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
challenging the shadows, he rises into the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers charge the baskets on the bottom of the crater with sulfur on their shoulders.
Despite its large profits, the mine company has not mechanized the reduction of sulphur in order to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), require of the tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and the human carrying.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human being" protested Madrusin, a staggered, 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since the school was left at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itchy, when the wind suddenly turns and the mineworkers are stuck in the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one is complaining about serious diseases... of course, except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with its 53 years is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat's path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometres away.
"I am not going to retire, I am going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest, with his 30 years, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time goes by, but the poor hold generation on generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as a human lastessel at the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapore people blame the fact that they have no children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child education.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us complete our civil duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising for mint bonbons, but still - or just because of it - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs such as "pushing a" bao "(laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has made the video, keeps the hope that the advertising spot will reach a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their "national duty."
This is just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of reproduction, so we realized that this is a subject we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed-dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as we can to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this issue easily are the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapore people have children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marital and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has enabled people to have much more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities, except to marry and to form a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single persons and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counter the reduction of the population has led to resentments among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely cashed xenophobia is blooming against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are being criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make sure that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the life-style of the single person and that they are afraid of building large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the discussions with the Singapore people working in the financial district will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, so it is pushed away by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women are leading their careers, the stress and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singapore people have the last word when it comes to having children - so much can be done by the government.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any kind of interference."
What's private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and the social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term "something very own" to the personal level and "to the password and the user" when applying it to the social networks.
"I would not announce my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm wasting my time with friends, too.
"I would not share a photo that is not of me, or of someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just upload them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends" he says.
In question, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone saw a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits to not know 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one told him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone is pushing me or asking me to do it, I will just remove it from my user account" he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's experience is not unknown, which is known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He only made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unsympathetic to me or I wanted to wipe one out of him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide the children and young people, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of the social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information, but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's title in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants," formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants they are supposed to teach, while we are still learning," he says.
He explained that this is a complex issue, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what can be disseminated, published or said, and at an age where the maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be picky when it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to be published a photo of you, like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what the others are doing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission first when you tagged photos of parties?
And one more question: do everyone need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online, as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not speak to strangers."
Closure of the Unasu Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasu) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was to be signed theoretically by the seven governors present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasu. Sources in the State and President's Office at the beginning indicated that they would be handed it over after the examination, but then stated that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they said that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the image of the president meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio."
The few information that was circulating among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the Unasu governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was published during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who called for more information.
After that, the President of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "Final Declaration" of the Summit, but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document at the end of the Summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a strong press call, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced before, was not published.
On the official website of the ASSPA you can see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but to a large extent they limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which settled a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago, to listen to the requests of both sides.
"We will follow and implement the judgment on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is, and remains, a country that is in keeping with international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, concluding agreements and submitting to the international courts," adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a hand-pressure in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the IGH was made after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasu since 2011 after the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit in Lima shortly after the midday.
The head of state read the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total investment of $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasu will "take important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
It announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve the territorial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian, which were on the cross-sections of its area from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should provide a better connection with Ecuador, even though it did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will be used for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was stressed at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the beginning of his participation in the regional meeting, that he expected a meeting in Mexico on Saturday with his opponent of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict with respect for an IGH judgment called into question by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will all look at these ways - they are not excluded, and the agreement with Nicaragua also requires talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the take-up of the new President of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the block for the adoption of the 2013 action plan also met in advance, in order to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the president of the regional block.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasu), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "today are practically a country of the country."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that will drive the member states of the Unasu.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, must be achieved; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA), with a view to reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return, we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is based in Washington and financed by the United States," he said as a reference to the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but rather had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that at the time there had been "reasonable assumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his proceedings would not be followed."
He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which he had asked for him to be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish case law allows this through a video conference that could have been carried out through the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk that the health and mental state of Assange would be affected.
"Since he was in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there was a risk that he would take physical and mental damage because he was trapped in a narrow room and could not carry out physical exercises outside.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for asylum granted to Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since June was to grant a free letter to travel to Ecuador and that this would be in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has a number of procedures on various European bodies," he said.
And "if Britain grants this free letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden heard Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or about Skype, as Swedish case law allows and in other cases has been done, the problem is done.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocracy, the evil intention and the lie that disrupt freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and blackmail profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself on the fact that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and also by the bankers or hegemonic and skewer-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in a re-election he would "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasau at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not allow any opportunism and no legally disguised coup d'état" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated in full so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also trusted in the same Court of Justice for a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international authorities if both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he would be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third mandate in a row, he stated that he "sees this possibility with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to take this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to go back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a relapse in the health of President Chávez," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state today took part in the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasu) in Lima, which ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The reason for dying because of AIDS is now too late to recognize
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the results of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb had hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor "tried to weaken" without any apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to find out about it; and this with such commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the hospital who know nothing about their disease and who have already done damage to the virus and have exhausted their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, that is, after the first reported cases, "today's great success means that the survival of a patient taking up treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded since 2008 that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of treatment, and that those who are not drug-dependent would have greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive the HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can in this sense "easily become 75 years old as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be recalled that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report), it is true that 60% of patients in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year there are 187 deaths, but it is assured that there has been universal access to the antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why are people still dying of it?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's what's in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnoses are required, which is why it is necessary to offer massive recognition tests to all those who need it."
This proposal is accepted by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on Aids Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out in a private laboratory, for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was for improvement, I feed well, drive sports and take the drugs.
All his parents know today is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate those who are afraid today in the context of the world's AIDS day.
They should take the test if they are part of the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
There are large holes between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
The distribution of condoms has actually been increased in the places in which it is intended; in the past they have been delivered individually, now they give us packages of a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom, "he said.
The young people are at risk of new infections.
"What do you need it for?" is a common mockery of social workers, guidance staff in schools, in pharmacies and in the health system, which does not want to be exposed to young people, the correspondent assured.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the shop table, but in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote democracy.
They are not to be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González answered the question of whether the Preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is in the fourth place of new and combined AIDS cases, and in the 13th place of HIV.
92% of cases of infection are caused by sexual intercourse, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities, which was reached through a trade course in Mexico, a disastrous precedent is being created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country with payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas results in the Mexican companies being helpless in the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the appeal court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first says that the main proceedings are the trade course dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency procedures for companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute being used as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass that Vitro's branches had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Concourses).
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro at the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, as of 2008, Vitro is responsible for his difficult situation as part of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country a beating.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects to the same court of appeal in order for the vote to take place in plenary, that is, by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare opposition, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, shall be lodged in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Law on Trade Conforms and points out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules on cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-volume carambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance
After several months of failure by the Mexican air transport trade unions against the former owner of Gastón Azcárrraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal case against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of impeding the judiciary.
After that, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the operator in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the bank's IXE trust account on the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
This appropriation is intended to cover the purchase of shares by the Administradora Professional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder in the hotel chain of Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up to this, the Canacintra (the national Chamber of the manufacturing industry) has managed to unite the governors in the south-east in order to resist the monumental establishment, the partly protected areas destroyed and the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government did not comply with a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known as ACTA, the matter has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, even though the Senate had not considered the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In order to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings stock market certificates of over 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four same issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Founding of Competitive
Founded by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, the leading information technology company, a group of companies was established under the name "Competitive," the objective of which is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hentin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world-jumper of the basketball, Héctor "Hentin" Reyes, was connected to the basket sport for more than 60 years and travelled the whole world.
A few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hentin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, be it as a lower-class player, player of the first national league, agent and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"I have spent my life in basketball on many hats, even at the same time as I was President of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when he visited Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and witness them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros' championships since 1967 as a managing director, co-executive or coach.
There were many years of performance, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, "says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong and 2 m large player.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best throwers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
After that came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee, who let us repeat the last move for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as is the one who won the 2004 Summer Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, like when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against each prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armanto Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the bandage?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas," where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family at The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved birth town of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full," Gray said in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he was undergoing a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman was known on television as a nice type in 1965-1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also the actor of two comedies, which were only broadcast for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film works included well-rated roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing-Clan and other figures in their area was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising claim "Who shot at J.R.?," which was intended to create expectation for an episode of emotions where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in competitions.
The series then reached a record of the audience at that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned "Dallas" into the second most-seen entertainment programme since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who had shot the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had made her pregnant and threatened to present her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a hideous businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) appointed.
"I know what to say on J.R. 's tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and outside the screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and remains in our hearts, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their home.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't write anything that I thought could hurt or affect someone in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he worked for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are due and after," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also fought against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course, which studies the "end of the world"
Every week, the students study apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long back counting" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, some called "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict with Israel, the place of which the Christian theoreticians believe the apocalypse begins.
"I did not notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé said this week to the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds me that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" of this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history.
In Temple, the accompanying professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, the students study apocalyptic issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We are analysing why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behaviour.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared with real life.
"I have tried to inform the students what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a member professor of art history and anthropology, have set up a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World."
"We do not take in 2012 so that we can always keep the option of holding the course again in case the world does not go down," said Restall.
Despite the "impending failure," students have to study, create projects and take part in final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance of "continuing to work until the night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no more seats in two hours," said Restall about his high-average course for students who filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect- or religious mentality is actually only a question of comfort or its lack.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing has declared that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less a professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculation.
"People don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course on the "end of the world."
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophical that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after the end of the world came.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they want to go to parties about "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
