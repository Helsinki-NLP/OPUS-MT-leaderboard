DFB-Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that one comes to the discussion, that one also talks to him about why he obviously felt the one or the other as it is laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäer" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite the months of debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case up to a certain point, "said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also given him the reason that Grindel had not defended him against racist enemies during the World Cup.
The DFB-Chef repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal Trainer Joachim Löw and Teammanager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a shame that this conversation has not come about so far."
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartensettlement burned
At 2: 13 p.m. the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angerhöhfweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade pulled out and found the hut in full fire on arrival.
The roof had to be practically removed and fire debris was removed to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery for the shop at noon.
That could be the fire thing.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - as is the case with the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectors in his garden cottage.
Angry mother is fighting: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What did Lindsay Lohan do to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") himself has spread live as she seems to want to take away the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Luckily Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family is running from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She's accusing the adults of doing child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," is Lohan in the video to hear her follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing a slap.
With tears, the actress bursts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What has led Lohan to this action is now completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is intended to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The land "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the strength of 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Head
In the beginning was a tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk caused a disturbance in the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletroautobauer.
The US stock market surveillance sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss is withdrawing from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain the Chairman of the Board.
Congress of the British Conservatives
Slightly guarded - the Tories' Party Day
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The meeting will be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, on the front front of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting over these name-duplications for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future, and this is what the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it will be all right?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing lists of Bolsonaro.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing list of Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" gives itself as an anti-system candidate and is thus in the front of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Diesel gate" treatment takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still in place," said Peter Mertens, the development board of the industry "Automotive Week."
In December 2017, Rupert Stadler, the imprisoned and certified Audi chief, announced that the Taskforce would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested," he said at that time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important stage in the process of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel channel at the Audi-Mutter Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on the future of Stadler on Friday and wants to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the gas fraud has become known.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot is currently head of the company as the head of the company.
Because of the change to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Voice."
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot is counting on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there were already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel is seeking re-election - Lahm is to be elected to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to re-run for office as the DFB President in spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair next year.
"I do my work and I try to do it as well as possible," said Grindel as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on the early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to re-elect, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "want to work on the future project" after the contract for the football-EM 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as a successor to Wolfgang Nielsbach, who has fallen over the summer story affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM-Chief Organizer Philipp Lahm is to be involved in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to be a member of the Bureau in this role and would, of course, be very invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a result of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
At present this office of the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is one without a migration background clearly in society and football and says," the subject is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel.

A scale that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat content.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the swabs.

With 20 points, Rokas Giedraitis was the top-scorer of the dominant Berlin.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 meters), who was required from Ludwigsburg, also showed an attractive performance in front of 9113 spectators in his compulsory-game debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the mandatory debut of coach Ainars Bagatsky with 84: 80 (39: 37) with s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with the guests with the best 24 points.
Würzburg-professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 meters.
Last year's playoff half-finalist MHP giants Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83: 76 (41: 34).
Karim Jallow was the best player in the team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a clear success.

The new player Will Cummings overcame the Oldenburgers with 25 meters.
The Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the beginning of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run of the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver living supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in action - among them also snipers.
The Islamic Association of Ditib is critical because it is considered to be an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, buyouts and terror seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Engage yourself wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival at the night of Sunday in front of some 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and I'm ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also showed up in the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a second of terror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shooting, scared and tried to escape.
A short time ago there was panic, people ran into a mess.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, the organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin, however, calmed people off the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one, had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was cheering and applause from the audience - but for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
The latter, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on stage, was in favour of more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the US Senate's Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, and so had a lot of women in mind.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse to the point of attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations, after two women, who according to their own data have experienced sexual attacks, confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," said Flake at the concert in New York to the audience.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the journalist's throw-out
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended the release of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action had created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he made people protect the man.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is completely independent of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged spy activities or of the support or membership of forbidden parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are in danger of being detained for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
The recent cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey, trials are still being carried out against them.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice already: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for the humid-happy conversations at the counter of the Hamburg port-pub "Schellfisenposten."
Moderator Ina Müller has a lot of beer, some wine or even more high-quality drinks with her guests to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities are also taking on courage for the compulsory singing.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known from films like "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horriest Day."
But the trip to the high north of Munich was not good at all.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely snapped on it, the eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
He posted to his fans some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now won: "Rule one: NIE goes to Anna's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And splash.
And let go of the round of egg liqueur that Ina throws at half past three.
The alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the post-war.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the normally attractive movie star.
As Ina Müller has survived the night-to-day drinking, it is not known so far.
But since she has been modeling the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to have been much more tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and disadvice
The entry into the 36-kilometre long railway cycle path in the Red Krappchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and be tiled.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette taps, garbage and unrat, demolished garbage bins and now disassembled signs - this is how the entry with a seat group to the cycle path on the Haasße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the show object of the railway cycle path in the Red Kappchenland a more than unpretentious sight.
The theme has been employed by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, but also others for a long time, according to the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Radverkehrsbezirk.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the transfer of the seat group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of any other activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the subject has also been included in the local council.
It is not only the waste that drives cyclists and residents around - the sitting group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often done loudly, in the streets it is also destroyed: posts are torn out of the ground, trash can is destroyed, signs are nailed, seat furniture is embellished.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest place on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting point for a drink.
"Along the entire cycle path there is clearly the focus here on the Haasße hill," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Goat Hain, which is being opened today.
"If she has the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "It may be that the threshold is much higher to get involved in common good.
This would, however, require a police strike to come by in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haasße-Hügel.
It had to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourist marketing is still able to expand.
Our cycle path is very high quality compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as a very critical hazard.
There's no turn-off on the Haasße hill.
In the case of traffic, it may happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-way traffic flows, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but it is a problem for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the cultural station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and with one another.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city-part-effensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with eye wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived Albachtener in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper star colors," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet seen this in other parts of the city.
What were the texts connected with?
In the places, the Hiltruper Lake and the market allee were particularly frequently mentioned.
In his song, Rolf Ihmig called the Allee "Kö von Hiltrup."
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about the experience of being together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints to their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
From the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he was recently in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has, in the meantime, placed everything on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all the participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
But there was something special for the Jury's favorites - so that others can hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can play an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tolle.
Like all of them, the children appeared again at the final - and even sound "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, inanimity of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klimfass from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Business Association, as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City Council.
The city-part offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event to be a full success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a view screen, in it four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only when you have put it in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
The cards then say, for example, to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
3. Dice.
4. Feast. "
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms that should be guessed here, but the codes.
In turn, one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card that might have "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto" it is not to be guessed the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: in this order and in this example, he should describe the terms "dice," "fest," and "windows," in such a way that his own team can recognize the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible, because that will win the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The Encryptor notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the dice, "lots" as opposed to the Fest; here, of course, something like "party" is possible and "Prague" because he has been watching the school and knows the window crash there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
One does not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be more correlated with any hint the Encryptor gives there.
So the rewriting should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic on "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But those who have first started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconspicuous game.
But overall, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as predecessor and genre primus "code games," which also puts an agent theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about guessing and not about winning points, can also easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hillerbruß and harms guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hillerguss in the Upper City of a passing police strike, then later he also appeared in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic, he did not comply with the police's given place reference, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the Haftzelle.
In a sober state, he must then also be responsible for the use of unconstitutional organisations.
The Pressig plant was home to the Schaubloks
The railway operation in Pressig was for decades the hub in the Frankenwald.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, they heard it all over the press," Georg Dinkel remembers, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It didn't upset anyone.
The brakes were squeaking and the wagons were banging.
It was just a railroad.
Statements that are useful for Dinkel's home of prestige.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain line to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters has its top point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, it used to be necessary to use train and drawers that had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 loco-shed, apprenticeship-shop, direction and railway-master.
"The heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional seisenbahner.
The BW Pressig, which was under the command of Bamberg in 1968, also operated Loks for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehsten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed at the time in Passig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and drawers.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Up to 1991, at least 10 000 weighing units were held per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were cut off and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not envisaged better use of the site, including in the field of freight transport."
On Pentecost in 1989, the railway directorate of Nuremberg celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
A little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressier train station was history.
"The Rangers and Incubators did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station of Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with impact at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winners Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges has already done before.
Kerber won the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzeva from Kazakhstan or the Spanish woman Carla Suárez Navarro.
He led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Daria Kassatkina, when the Russian set at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontakteit from Estonia.
In the context of the series "Art and pleasure" a special exhibition in Mitteleilbach was opened this weekend.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors saw the ideal weather when the special opening of the "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mitteleilbach.
It takes place under the roof of the "Rum um Walberla" tourism club in the context of the "Art and Enjoyment" series.
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great interest in visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mitteleilbach.
House owner Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He's been there himself since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his job into proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
In the past, both have already played an active part in the selection of the artists and have played a part in the design of flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of art & pleasure, there is a 70-cent special stamp, which they designed, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn auskörten," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high level of support of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical frame.
During the walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windspiel-Performance" is a formal challenge to the artistic imagination and ultimately a playful expression.
It is made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the estate the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, with 20 wind-rags, 24 horseshoes and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bush in the background, the object looks fairytale and invites to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Wassneck, who is dedicated in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K & G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On half-way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for a stroll through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albums: Singer celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the people of the Albachtener also gave way to their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no longer a sanslife in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch, they took the MGV 68 Alpachten out of baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of the Encounter."
"It will be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachtener Singer.
They had revived the foundation's feast for the anniversary of their own.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
The tradition festival was back on time for the 50th anniversary.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothes before.
The guests did not sit in the "House of the Encounter" in rows of seats, as usual, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Alachte made their own voice sound.
It was a good occasion to have some happy songs.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
The "Rüdesheimer Vine" was a good match for the exquisite vine juice that many had before them.
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin name for "hops."
Once again, the choral director of Richard Homann, who was one of the five who was in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such a light way, it's a master performance he does." By the way, this time, not only men presented themselves in a singing way.
The women's choir "Hohe C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly covers Evergreen from the 20's to the 60's.
After all, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until 3: 00 in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented sound-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre in the Allweather zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd Liga Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring is really good in Liga 3.
No sign of shyness or frakking, the independent are doing their thing.
And the 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against the city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed to this: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening, at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third movement the guests had a set ball.
"If they get it to the finish, such a game can go off," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routined forces, made it all clear and brought the full yield into the finish.
"We all know who's on the other side in a derby like this.
It doesn't break our neck.
I have seen really good volleyball in a phase, "Annacker did not have the 0: 3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independent is going, it does not seem to be foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
This is not almost comparable with regional league volleyball. "In the fourth league, they don't want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not polluted in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will be in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the show might have had a part in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left forever.
The show, which made her a star, could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues saw me on an eye-level, "says Keller in a conversation with the" picture on Sunday. "
At first she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that had changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She considered it possible that her husband at that time might have been envious, but "how many men also shook Hans talks about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have changed, "as she further explains.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the wedding, I was in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
= = References = = = = External links = =
Why didn't it ever work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love at that time "as presented in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I have approached love far too naïve. "
The Nachtfalter, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the ZZZ-resort Zurich, has dared this time to the ZFF opening party.
Our fold is not a moth, but a little light-proof.
And the bright shine, in which a green carpet is dipped in the armpit, blends it for a fee.
But it's just a film festival, and more or less famous people want to sunk in the spotlight.
This late Thursday night, he is torking over the square to make it easier for a short time in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase."
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the "need-for-care" facility in the Parterre of a new pavilion is taking a lot of effort to engulf a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks to heaven in the Lord's Oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who just had a good time in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book," are celebrating the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-story department store, like every year.
His name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown are from the whole world.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival, so that you do not fall into a slant advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The fold binds a little bit of a twig around the feelers that gave him a good fairy, and two pungent doorstewards actually wave him in generously.
In the inside, the bailiffs, they dance to live music far after midnight, or let DJ give you rhythms to which they yell at each other, and flush down exquisite pies with Cüpli.
In the delicacy shop in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for shredding mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is cut up fresh, a chocolate fountain is sprout.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to be working without much loss.
You have to love this country for it!
The fold studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If that's two separate instructions, he's lost his way in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly already saved lives.
In the household department on the upper floor, the bird tilts a cocktail called "Golden Eye," prepared with espresso, suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not necessarily given to this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting that brand for years, is not here that night either.
But there, between local celebrity, cash table and kitchen articles, a face that is known to the observer is passing by: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor may not be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen is about to walk through the crowd, with almost sixty of them acting like a choral boy.
He's not being played, he's not being played, he's not being stoned at the most.
Especially for this restraint, who likes to be misunderstood as a clumsy, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is pleased to be the winner of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home, Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as can be seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-player had defeated the Leones Negros with 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to last-minute-broke "destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club Sending ASV, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - broke - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had played well over long periods, the Sendener.
Only the initial phase "we have completely overslept," the ASV coach was angry.
The house owners led quickly at 8: 1, even the early time-out, which Bieletzki had taken, did not at first frustrate.
"But then suddenly a back went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the delay was only two goals.
In particular, Senden's best, Marius Hintze, met one time at a time.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst made a 15-15 move, and then the staff changer was almost continuous.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Inform the imparties into action.
Bieletzki is usually afraid to seek the guilt of others.
But: The 120-second time sentence that Steffen Mühlhoff collected "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and met four times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also stood well against seven men in the back and threw them on the empty gate again and again.
But they can't buy much for the compliments.
"Now we have to get a fucking victory," says the completely served Bieletzki.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an then 18-year-old from Naila (district of Hof), the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
On Saturday, forces dug up a road at Marxgrün.
To this end, the road floor and several layers were taken away, as the police and the public prosecutor shared.
According to new information, the missing person may not have been buried far from their former place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Court of Justice and the Public Prosecutor's Office has been working intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators, using a ground radar, found a conspicuity under the road near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be published during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking in the network.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passwords to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, even it does not harm to equip computers with an antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the millionaire company.
He and the US Stock Exchange Supervision SEC filed an out-of-court dispute on misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk will be the Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German supervisory board.
He may remain the head of the board against it.
In the comparison that must be confirmed or confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also the head of space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, who is now being rated on the stock market with more than $50 billion.
Musk is not aware of guilt
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed at the lawsuit.
He had always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, and that the financing was secured.
In this way, Tesla would have been rated as a total of $72 billion.
Later, Musk rerouted: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After the querels of the past few weeks, the GroKo is collecting several survey-deep blows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one meter to 17 percent, the SPD gives one point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
Also CDU and CSU lose a counter and only come to 27 percent.
This is the lowest value to date for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15%, the left 11% and the FDP 10%.
If on Sunday's Bundestag election, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get together only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
In this way, the great coalition has now lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties come to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second-largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, and the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the proportion of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the Bundestag election in 2017.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor's office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS showed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) would like the big coalition to hold in three years' time until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there had also been a significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also split their assessment of whether Merkel should re-run for the CDU Presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
As a result, 64 per cent of the Union's candidates wish to be candidates, 35 per cent not.
Outhang at Aldi: Price reduced for love happiness
Will Aldi become Tin 2.0?
Those who say that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic connoisseurs stories - they should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of the digital "fast food date" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket, as a connoisseur place for the great love, is almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, Boxershort bargain at the vole table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We have dared the test: How do women react, you don't talk about the hot bush for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory potential has it when the love happiness precedes an out-the-eyes-lost-and-found-plot.
If the guy also reports to his worshiped at the e-mail address bio-putenmein @ gmx.de, then it already sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and varieties - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this Annonce in an Aldi branch that is unknown to us is to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat."
To believe in the magic of the analog learning, she definitely deserves her happy end à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has taken part in the action "Lid against Polio - 500 Lid for a Life without Pneumatic Paralysis."

The disease described in German as a paralysis leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, Polio is considered to be extinct, but there are three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be dampened by vaccinations, as is stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And this is not good for us, "said the friend of Götze, Reus, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush in contract talks with Hecking

"There will certainly be the moment we sit down and talk," said Eberl on Sunday night on the TV channel Sky.
Football: District League: Researchers' appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrhein makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court hard with his own.
Wortkang, the coach of the football club VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (inside) to make sense of the lack of performance on the green.
It's all a story.
In the meantime, it's going around the Brandhoveweg again.
Tauberian evidence is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrhein, in the past season only a little bit of a bit of a step past the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We have made the rooms narrow and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen, "Fetsch praised his boys and looked for each and every one of them to simply say" thank you "for so much defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly to a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more play parts in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his departure (17.), who changed Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
It almost avenged itself when the SCA, in the same time as two times in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer, was dangerous in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters just failed.
Schroer was also late for a Thewes entry after 58 minutes.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left side again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Alerrhein's Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release for the place owners 18 meters in front of the guest case.
The foul himself entered and demonstrated its dangerous nature at standards.
Westhues' thing with the right damper hit down left from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71st).
20 minutes to go.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room unhappily to the hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
In the final phase, Wolbeck had to survive long minutes before Geske had the victory hit on the pusher in the 87th minute from 12 meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Helicopters in Kottingbrunn
At the landing there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
There was a drama on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was captured by a wind bow, crashed on the ground and came to the side to the end.
The police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately informed.
With a large-scale service, the forces came to the site of the accident.
To be careful, the ÖAMTC notarzthubscrewdriver was also called.
Inmate only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and could go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been resolved and the subject of the investigation.
According to the fire-fighting spokesman Franz Resperger, a small fire came in, but it could be quickly extinguished.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1, as is shown in the report "The Power of Monoculture," which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was before the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them," said Foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, only male management teams - with a few exceptions - have long since been unthinkable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking in comparison.
It's a different business culture.
The small increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive impulses from the companies in the medium-sized index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8% of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value had still been 3.8 percent.
The proportion of women in the 30 Dax companies - leading the way in recent years - has stagnated.
The last 26 women worked on the board.
"I am sure that next year the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to take a self-commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is given by the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5% - 45 more women and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If we were to recruit as many women per year for the board of directors, we would have reached a 40% share in 2023," says the report.
Some even make bad things: luxury carrots: which manufacturer deserves the most per car?
The best thing is Ferrari deserves.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Those who make the most of the noblemen in each car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenheffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 euros of operating profit with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put on a lot of weight in every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of between 33,000 and 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros in profit before interest and taxes.

Torch to the opening of the 60th Abtwinder Weinfest
With a torchlight, the Tourist Association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.
For the 60th time, the association will organize the wine festivals, which will continue to rise every Saturday in October in the big Festzent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the leaders of the Spielman train moved from Wiesenbronn through the place to the festival.
In the already high-profile holiday tent, the chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of doing something like this - this is a great achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that, "Start thanked all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later came in symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many of us have found the way to Abtswind again." Later, "The Troglauers" provided a mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the prices for drinks as it was 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before one day later in the Festzent in the second round.
In Bonn: Notarztauto klacht in Taxi
An emergency car is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger has been killed in the collision of the operation vehicle with a taxi.
When a medical practitioner is called, they should help - best to save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian in Bonn was killed.
The taxi driver, the ambulance and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the notary car had hit a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met at a crossing with the taxi that was driving at Green.
The doctor's car, after the collision, swung against an ampelmast and a tree.
At the same time, he captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
driver of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from the force.
The also severely injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried to do this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we untiring it
Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU 1: 3. The way of defeat should still be spoken.
The scene was useful in the 74th minute, in which the reborn Marko Arnautovic shot the 3-1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an off-side at the pass of Mark Nobel, all the defenses of Manchester stopped and Arnautovic left all the time in the world to take the ball to the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of an already long-term insufficient performance.
At the moment, the state of the mind of United's city rival Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola, came against Brighton & Hove Albion for an unendangered 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's defense bar for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero provided the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leaders
In the Premier League three days after the 1-2 defeat, Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool won a 1-1 against Chelsea.
Like the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the London.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came into the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, just missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
It was better for Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his sling.
After the Reds had started with a flawless balance sheet in the week, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the London team eliminated the team of Jürgen Klop in the Cup, and the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table by the Remis in the league.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where granite Xhaka played through, had to wait for a success report against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford's defenseman, Craig Cathcart, debuted Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil, with his third season hit, made the decision.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, passed Watford and was again in the position of fifth place behind the great rival Tottenham. A strong impression is left by the climber Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated for the fifth time in a row at the 2-0 against Southampton and finished 8th in the league.
VW core brand is missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show is held every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
In the car salon 2018, they will be presenting their new products in the French capital, together with the competition from all over the world.
The diesel actually doesn't matter much anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, are still likely to be an important issue, at least behind the brilliant scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models included: The e-tron of the Ingolstädter is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart 2019.
But both have been officially presented.
The iNext of BMW is due to start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors will be present this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport connections have been damaged, and there has been enormous damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will still increase significantly.
The figures have so far only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of help.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-cyclist.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at the Haus Nordblichten.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, about 150 bikers had come together on Sunday to do anything but ordinary service.
From 10 o'clock on, the Bolides had already been raised in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first the biker-early shopping was on the program and it was possible to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a strong curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the Biker service by the priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetic and quiet," said Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novel in the history of the motorbike service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a great feast: after the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also of great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice step by step to his astonishing audience.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the great funnel.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step of work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little apple piece, looking a little like heckelgut, layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had already finished specialities.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the latest spring white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly large.
In a comfortable atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of pressing the apple, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active of the Füchtorfer cameradschaft of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited to some stations to play curvature games.
The home club will also offer a day of action in the coming year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, will not be the home in the heart of the Asparagus village the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject: after all, the milk will go round.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season-broke: "Crap situation"
After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
There were, however, many positive points in the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The more victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslim (86) came to the conclusion, stand at the bottom with two meters and in their current constitution are a candidate for a descent.
On the other hand, led by the superior Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first home season victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general test for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, was set to score seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen in his first debut and never to get control of Hannover's defense.
The striker, who had been hit long after the World Cup, showed with his speed and enforcement, why he is so valuable for the harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was borrowed from Liverpool, was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurter, which began swungingly.
A head ball of Lucas Torró (17.), which was forged on the net of the gate, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, in a promising position, Sébastien Haller was stopped by the 96-defense of Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords was almost inevitable and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defensive corner in the penalty room, Haller extended the ball per head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed up before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who was able to fuel through and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser did not leave a chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak idea of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little bravely forward, but the burning ideas remained out until just before the end, when the connection hit was still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only show-running for the Frankfurt-based guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix square becomes a party mile
In spite of cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter made it to millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies' n last week with two punches.
Geisingen: Spiritual Christians celebrate the Holy Cross Feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or Sunday after.
The Festive Service takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who is from the 30-year-old war and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this, a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not yet finished, only the altarpiece is standing, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the parish of Geisinger.
After the service the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place, and with the final blessing the church part of the Cross Feast ended.
For many years the Catholic Church Choir has invited to the secular part of the Feast to the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided visitors with savoury food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm house.
In the afternoon, the parish community still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until the next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual calls for tenders prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already in place a few years ago has become greater, but more has been found, which was only possible by the insight by scaffolding.
The sockery works have been completed, the natural stone works will be started before the winter, and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblick Street
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblick street.
The fact that in the Münsterblick street "a very special house" is now being handed over to its purpose - all present were in agreement at the inauguration date.
Finally, the 12 wheelchair users who have been living in the home of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account more wide corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officer building was put to the test for the inhabitants with a handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment," Bader said retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators started to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel at home in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new home
About 4.6 million euros was invested in the new building.
The free state added 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
The managing director of the Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The split between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that let the inhabitants experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
In a similar way, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its inhabitants who need help to be mobile."
In doing so, the hospitality and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The land in this position is a real case of luck, because it is no longer to be purchased in this situation."
In total, the new dormitory in the Münsterblick street has a capacity of almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three groups of living.
Proud is the life-aid director Heinz on the 11 full-time workers, all of whom are employed by the tariff.
Germany: Swedish complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, has appealed to all the countrymen not to take advantage of the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unit.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the" Day level on Sunday. "
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germany, on average, worked longer than the people in West Germany, but would receive 15% less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this puffy dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungan hunting dog shall smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made a gift for South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their destination on Thursday.
They thus passed the border place of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food, in order to "facilitate the adaptation of the animals."
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift had announced the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to take part in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months now, many new books have been published, most of which answer this question in a look back on the past hundred years.
It is very different to Wolfgang Maderthan, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to material work - this is the unofficial motto of the Great Coalition's working week, which is beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not, at the last, vowed the "return to material work."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other people in this country to the right question, which is the difference between work and work, but be it there.
When the Federal Government is now ready to rededicate itself to its mission - to the government - it should not be stopped now by means of word debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blamages of the last few weeks will perhaps already show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties will meet to the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to regularly convene this round to defuse conflicts at an early stage; a lesson from all this argument.
First of all, however, there are again conflict-related issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofitting and the law on skilled immigration.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with the exchange premiums, and the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has shown an approach over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned law on the labour migration of workers.
The SPD calls for a permanent perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
It is not the same that has joined forces with the GroKo, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without a dispute, a society that is so diverse and sometimes contradictory is not going forward.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not be raised again for parteitactic reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should fight - but always have a view of the life-reality of the people.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the trace change question can be resolved in a pragmatic way - and thus regain confidence.
This is why the people's parties must now fight.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visier
Is the Minister of Labour in particular in breach of the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Real day and night" would have been working on the social security reform of their legions, reported an overweight social minister at the presentation of it two weeks ago.
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) in the case of list-mushroom Mandate Daniela Holzinger is a surprise - she now brings the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumed that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and not to announce any violations of the right of service in front of running cameras."
However, she now has questions in order to "be able to acquit Har tinger of any suspicion."
Police are looking for a woman's body to open a street
Marxgrün - The police did not want to speak about it for a long time.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is dug.
The line is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archeologist.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, could finally limit the relevant site to a few meters in multiple use.
In addition, a ground anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said road section.
For more than a year, the prosecution and the police have been working on the missing person case.
In the case of Marxgrün, a cycle path was closed and tested with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the state road, the hot body could have been buried 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
The controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first year on Monday.
But before that, there will be riots.
The separatists did not forget the police service of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence Referendum of October 1, 2017, there have been clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the supporters of independence, among other things, with paint powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3000 police officers from the police units, the Policía Nacional and the Guardia Civil, wanted to honor their colleagues in a rally last year, who were in use in the referendum, which was considered illegal.
In trying to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the about 6000 separatists would have tried to break the police chain by force, and, among other things, the officials would have been thrown with color bags and eggs.
Six people had been arrested, and 24 others had been slightly injured, they said, referring to the authorities.
The first year of the independence referendum is on Monday.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to be in custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the Catalan's "right to self-determination."
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gewährluss: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torless
Red-and-white Ahlen continues on the spot.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The final light and the third last one unfolded in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a racket.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without any worry.
There was no risk of missing a chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
The first (harmless) goal shot of the whole lot was in charge of the 28-minute freight-sleigh Nick Flock.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the border.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sian Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel made a 18-metre target of just over the case and after an hour, the freight-payers appeared for the first time in offensive.
After a boom of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly presented counter over Sian Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a but a gentle shot in the arms of RWA-goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a head ball of Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA-interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also did nothing.
Angelo Daut then tried to make the positive point: "I like that we played to zero." But unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"This time, we were not as dangerous as we were against woodwork, and this even though our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim trainer.
Offensitively, "everything was so a little" against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel that we could get a counter-gate, "Daut said.
As a spectator, however, one did not feel as if his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Rackenfields Harvest thanks market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
This is what Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Rackenfelder table distribution point for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure us: "These donations remain also in Reckenfeld."
At the opening the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a little empty, but that should change during the day.
For: "Here it is so nice and sociable, that is why we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the Feast Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper pinch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which was supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" could not be taken to entertain the ever-increasing visitors in between.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was happy.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many active groups with their stands, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a board," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in service at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "clean up" action that took place in September.
Our garden town is making a colorful painting - something is going on here.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klacht with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stands have been worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartfelt, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decupersaw.
Furnier work, beer cover with reckfield motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A specialty offered three reckfield beekeepers: "Reckfield honey," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschschschüter.
The latter has another specialty with it.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so the cake tasted good.
It is the sociability that made the visitors stay long until the evening hours, even without the stage program that is not available at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with local political message: No successful advertising for skates
In Lengerich, unknown people have probably hardly promoted the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are appropriate lubricants, says Jürgen Kühne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with material damage.
In large letters, the three words "skatepark for Lengerich!" on signs, among other things, at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering had already been discovered on the ad sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro after the professional election fair on September 19.
Since the short message had been left "only" with an edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the appropriate advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that on the board several large companies from Lengerich are also called.
If the skate system is built, its implementation should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explained Jörg Hesselmann of the urban department of school, sport and culture, without name.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the masked board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skate.
After the old LWL clinic was dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council, after all, voted in favour of the fire-fighting parking lot.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken against a construction at this point.
At the end of June a turn of turn followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now unanimously voted for the area of the Gutenberg school.
Jürgen Kühne says to the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
In the case of air traffic control, it is even worse
After the European air traffic chaos in summer, the German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said the head of the Air Safety Union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency, in front of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
An important reason for the many delays and failures is the long-known human resources shortage in European air navigation services, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade union.
The market for fully trained pilots is empty throughout Europe.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone for the monitoring of the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal government, countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, this will not work without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the German air traffic control system.
Maas once again held the EU Commission responsible for the Lotsen-Misere.
The transport forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting costs and staff savings in national air navigation services are now fully linked to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for rules that "do not cut off air" the air.
At the moment, the EU's requirements would be agreed by 2024 and there would be a fear of further tightening.
The EU was exposed to constant lobby pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair's head Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now reap exactly what they have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high delay costs of the airlines would lead to a rethinking.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The so far announced intake of 120 pilot pupils per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group redevelopment
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans for the conversion of the group.
According to the will of the Thyssenkrupp interim leader Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are expected to have their headquarters in Essen and to be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reduction beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two withdrawals, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
This is the case with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and suppliers.
Barcelona: Violence in the demos of police and Catalan supporters of independence.
In two parallel demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6000 supporters of independence.
The Catalan police tried with a large deal to keep the two protests away from each other.
According to the forces, however, the supporters of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and shot.
According to the data, there was also a gap between the participants in the various protests.
According to the rescue force, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police, with their demonstration, wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had gone against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government, almost a year ago.
At the same time, they called for better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they got us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, "did not come to provoke," the police said.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security gap with a mobile app has led to the temporary access of everyone to the personal data of ministers and members of the conservative British Tory party on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory Congress in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police reported a serious traffic accident on the "Bundesstraße" 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The forces are on the ground.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises for the top part: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia this evening," Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record master against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought-in star was the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor even without its own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is good," Allegri said.
Even if we have started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve made the game after the early delay through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst of the persecutors for the time being.
The goalhunter, who was won by Real Madrid, first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26-49.).
And after a corner by head ball, Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for the hit of head of defense Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had only to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach asked.
The best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to be even more repressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the impeccable series in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the past seven years already has six meters ahead of Naples.
The table range, which was trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58th) was decided the top part.
The Portuguese had to get in too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turiner Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.

The midfielder also played in the championship league game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half-hour": Ronaldo had flown off the square at the 2-0 victory of the Turinian and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly crunchy appearance, Rapper Kanye West has paid attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided the audience with a series of questions and a series of questions.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "Ye," the musician says.
"The being that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in line with the late singer Prince, when he took his artist's name.
The pseudonym, however, is not news.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "says the rapper.
Football: District League A1 Münster: Finally!
I did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no sense of his disappointment.
It was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more gripping, we have almost never faced him with problems. "Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's possibilities of shooting is being read.
There are two goals in 90 minutes, so it is only rarely possible to make games positive.
Football club A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, the first but used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early guidance (7.).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after a great work by Krause, he became free-standing.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höhne first failed to meet the goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the second shot Jan Blome also found his master in the "Sendenhorster Keeper."
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all of them forgave.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the gate line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had previously criticised ourselves hard, which was different today than in the last few weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schumacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0: 1 Krause (7.), 0: 2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: District League A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albums: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4
"I don't know what to think about it," he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all." He was supposed to mean the wingspan with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who appeared with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking naughty and drawn from thunder His players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
In fact, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albretts, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for the class content.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that were behind him.
"This was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we return after the 0: 2, as we hold against one of the top teams of the league over the entire season, that was already really phenomenal."
All the more bitter it seems that you have to go home with your empty hands.
Top goalhunter Lars Zymner brought the hosts to the lead with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2: 0 he put on the left side of the model for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was madness, what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent unenvious.
Shortly before the change of side, his own elf made the balance: McGill's free push from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long toreck (45.).
After the change of side it was McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crunchy, action-loaded game.
Nög shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann was able to do (69th).
Despite the overnumber, Albersloh was no longer able to match the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We must now focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strahbecher, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Tore: 1: 0 Zymner (24), 2: 0 Fröhning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nög (64.), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74. / Alachts).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The table leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and at the end the game ended 0: 0.
Media: The entire Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire board of football-second-player Dynamo Dresden has resigned according to media reports.
In the evening, several media asked for a joint letter from the Board of Saxony.
At first there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he left.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had said that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy of Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, has signalled that he would like to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
The term of office for Christian Wulff was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
In this way, Akademie Director Udo Hahn calculated him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellor have already been with us." The fact that celebrities appear at the Academy at the Tutzing Castle again and again, however, was also a topic at the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective. On September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised to receive the "Tolerance Prize" given to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route over the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarian without limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mockers every human idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society, to the scissors between the poor and the rich, to the radical change of work through digitalisation.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."

The birthday of Karl Marx is about to come, one more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, the other more likely to expect a tendency "from the left to the middle."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100% a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music Cabinet: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabarettestin, Teubner had the gender understanding before, not only with humor and heart warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used them and also mastered their violin.
Ben Süverkruep was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes up to the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanied Süverkruep Teubner, that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, the same as it was for the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had put in place a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: what would have been the result of Mozart's composing, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
In improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" to the "Song of Death," and from Mozart's g-minor symphony, it is a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
The flowers were presented to Karlheinz Kleintje, the treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the president Heidemarie Markenbeck did not have any additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo one in Wolbeck in addition to performing in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly corrected the number of victims.
10 passengers had been slightly injured instead of 15.

Handball: Ladies-Landesliga: Ahlener SG is holding the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The women had problems, especially with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn't get it under control, "said ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed about the many lost opportunities.
The concentration in the final made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore almost followed a delay until the end, was at the break at 11: 12 and later at 15: 18 (45.) at the back.
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hostesses make a decisive contribution.
In addition, Aydogdu set back room Merle Klement on the left-hand side, which then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bushkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlütmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd Liga Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the BSV Ostbevern volleyball players have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
The blue-white team won 3: 1 with the second-league climber VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out, "coach Dominik Münch was pleased after an almost impeccable performance of his team with the cut-down table leader.
The first passage was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12, he went to the vice-champion of the previous year at 25: 15.
Food was accepted in the two-bar, but did not come into play.
We've had a good time with her.
Our opponent was at high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12: 8. "Food changed the acceptance to three-bar.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food sucked in, and we got a little lulled in, "said Münch.
At the 18: 17, the volleyball girls from the Ruhr area first had the nose in front.
In the 19: 24, Ostbevern defeated four more set balls, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the exercise manager found to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "There we played consistently and quietly."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13 the blue and white men brought four with 25: 22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had a great day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Schertmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a heap of shards, which can only be easily intertwined," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network of Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common, reconcilable appearance.
"Instead of underlining the membership of the Muslims to Germany by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for its purposes," claimed Sofuoglu.
The broad exclusion of the German public had "strengthened many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally again Folktreff time.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the home club Nottuln is already holding its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtsmannei.
It's been a year since we made a folk meeting for the first time, almost exactly on the day.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottuln Home Association.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk party would be in Nottuln eta so quickly.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the official was always full.
"The program at the next Folktreff is as always a colorful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, Evergreens and old bays," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln again and again.
Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed with his accordion for the first "birthday of the Folktreff-"
He was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktraff remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktraff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night," inspired the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," it is said in the invitation of the home club.
Those who play an instrument and want to play an active role are invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is recommended to be there in time enough.
The meeting begins at 7.30 p.m., but the entrance is already at 7.30 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step on the way to the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority had approved the proposed merger, informed Linde on Sunday.
As a result, the million-dollar merger is still subject to approval in South Korea and, as a major hurdle, in the US.
At the end of the day, the chances of an insider's consent had improved because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle the 125-year-old existence of the district association for horticulture and land care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with an fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last foundation impulses for the Kulmbach Association for Horticulture and Land Care were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
He was, of course, called a different name at that time: as "district-sobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually about the fruit-growing, about flowers and horticulture at that time no one thought.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said district-home-minister Günter Dipbold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees were intended to cover long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
It is still the responsibility of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which have almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A close-to-nature horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role as the provision of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Mules" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said the district president Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experience in nature for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co you can collect a lot of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added the Landrat Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about the management and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
It used to come from the garden, it was dusty for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
"Nature is a state of existence, it was already in front of us and we have to focus on it," said the expert in fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, for the horticultural associations, there was the incentive not to let go, so that our home would remain beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl added.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the turblets of the Thurnau music club.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister is moving the UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they are giving both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and is postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrysstia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the Minister would not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, she is focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, said that the negotiators of Canada and the US had 48 hours to agree if Canada were to actually join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a new version of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday night (local time) they are now to be completed, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the U.S. Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate, Andres Manuel López Obrador, had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous streets in Hannover.
The Federal Statistical Office's accident atlas show all the 2017 clashes with injured and killed in Hannover.

City and ADFC want to use the data to make the streets safer.
Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily "O Globo."
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public performances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked in the open street at the beginning of September during an election campaign in South Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went on the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations also made racist and women-despised statements mobile against Bolsonaro's social networks.
In the economic metropolis of São Paulo, several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital of Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The President's election in Brazil is on October 7.
As ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been in the political business for a long time, but is now present as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a final vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful from this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known to be against homosexuals and blacks and to glorify the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is always shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the followers of Lula's left workers' party should be shot.
Europe takes back Ryder Cup titles
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, the European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale in front of the gates of Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn, in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days in the Le Golf National with great blows and outstanding team spirit, escaped the favored title defender USA for a toothless tiger Woods.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
On the death bed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasoline ', which was extremely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the most sold album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement as "street boy," who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night at the shoe factory: volume at the level of the press air hammerniglevel
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesee" and "The Ignition" suggest such a rewriting of the rocking live music experience on Saturday night in the room of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pur of three friends.
After the sound check and just before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands, the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night are very much in the eye.
Even the quartet "Tiger Bonessee" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince with the opening of the concert evening the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to a coherent and expressive interplay.
Although "adoration" calls are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
The fact that Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock in the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
It is not only the yearning, almost balladenistic "Take Me Home" that impresses with the change of melodic passages to the guitar-like rock rifles of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishauschen has, however, become a special notoriety since it was founded in 2005.
The band will present their hardrock on Saturday in full agility.
The fact that "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with their performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the tour in China of 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
In combination with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also set their own accents in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the '80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann provides a cheated solo, while running through the audience, to the sound that he felt even higher than before.
A certain volume is, of course, a part of a Hardrock concert. In the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to the mixed-pull team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of the air hammering, but is thus still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval," which "The Ignition" refers to on its website.
However, the Ahlener audience does not need an ear-numbing 120 decibels in nozzle-red blue thickness, as is the case with the annual metal-density in the north of the Republic.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and set fire to a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the sense of being transferred, can end up saying.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead in a sailing aircraft accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Essen airport.
In a parking lot at the airport of Mülheim / Essen a sailplane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
In the vicinity of Mülheim / Essen airport a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a sailing plane had crashed on the airport's trade fair parking lot.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a one-seater.
The plane was already on the landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a fixed tent on the airport site.
But there has been an October festival since this weekend.
The Mülheim / Essen airport is located on the border of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the driveway to the 52nd motorway.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump heals Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US President of North Korea is well-established despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
But now Trump has made his colleague a real declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the age of 72, the married President of the United States has become a new flame.
The tragic: it's a long-distance relationship.
In public, on Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sprouts of the Pjöngyang dynasty, although in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament it proved to be rather tough.
"I was tough, he was too, and it went back and forth between us," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection had also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have not seen much more than lip service.
The fact that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's nickname for Kim - is not for everyone seems to be quite aware of the US President.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it at his performance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling right away: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so unpresidential.
But he does not care very much, explained Trump and then directed his index finger to the crowd: "I have always told you, it is so easy to be president."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there in this stunned arena, but we would have only 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest lures many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler visited best, with a mood and on top of it pampered with sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestair, Baesweiler's city centre was cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the Festzent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees saved from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic conditions of detention in Libya by means of a mobile-phone video, thus enabling them to be saved.
In July, the group had shot and spread the recording in its cell in the coastal city of Sawija under the risk of life.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers," whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his colleagues had almost been beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions of arrest had been catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary return of refugees who have been stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their country this year with the help of the programme, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerian was not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he has not heard of a call for help by mobile video so far.
International organisations have long criticised the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as being unworthy of human rights.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the National School place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4: 50, the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a step into the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher called the police who took the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether things or money have been stolen.
Description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, a little darker look, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the police inspection Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in Central Franconia after he had taken the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon, rescue forces accidentally discovered the car near a pasture and liberated the missing person since Tuesday night, the police announced on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls on the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The two countries' relations are currently "overshadowed," said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne airport.
This was mainly the case with the wave of arrests, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important condition for this."
According to Laschet, the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey were also addressed.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a short-term building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's readiness to fly at Cologne Airport.
It was originally supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denucliarization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to meet.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking the negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula in the UN general debate with its continued sanctions.
"The recent standstill is due to the fact that the US is building on forced measures that are fatal to confidence building," said Ri in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament was unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that criminal measures in North Korea could "force the knees" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
However, in order to build trust, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant, Ri stressed.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the Minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council alone had adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have called for strict compliance with the sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to return to Pyongyang for talks on the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT serves: new kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT did not get anything: white ceilings and floral patterns on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not very easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break the bad surprise came: a power failure had put the huge, two-part fridge out of operation, the food was corrupt and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start over again: we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And so they all packed in.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"Chefs can't do better," a visitor was impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Father Frank Beckmann, while the sorcerer Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art was surprised.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of the Board
The head of the Essener Teller, Jörg Sartor, made his post in the Land Association out of fear of criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become known throughout the country because the Essen Table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-head of the NRW-boards, said Sartor the "World on Sunday."
There's too many of them in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Teller-Landesverband NRW, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism was taken by Sartor.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who did not know exactly why the Essen Table is doing this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen Table - "six days a week, nothing changes," said Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday" Sartor again criticised criticism of colleagues from other boards.
We must not follow the approach "without us the people in the city are starving."
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a conference of the boards on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet scorn," he said.
There are all these social fuczis who criticized me so much at the time.

Schalke comes against Mainz to the first season victory (1: 0).
(sda) In the first five games of the league, Schalke has manoeuvred into the off-side with early opponents four times.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again demonstrated the strength with which it had taken the first place behind the Bavaria in the last season.

Thanks to an exceptional comeback, Borussia Dortmund is reunited with the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had a 0-2 delay against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to the 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) were able to match with a double-blette for four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided a further double-blette in the final phase (86. / 91.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgart-based people had to fear against the Werder Bremen, which was decimated by a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious cast-in-the-house gate that helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a lead twice, finally played 2-2 and still wait for an away victory in the VW city since 2003.

Although Stuttgart's defenseman Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game by a curious cast-in self-goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgart-based overnumber back on the Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0 sovereign.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change their country's name in North Macedonia.
In a 'yes', the almost three decades of fading conflict with the neighbour of Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a Nato member if the referendum had been positive.
Syrians in submarines.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrians brutally beat three retired women and thus injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had landed on Friday at around 10: 00 in the escape street in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went on passersby with clenched fists and tried to attack them.
The Syrians then tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later, it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground in the Wahlinger Street at a tram stop.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
The retired women were partly severely injured.
They suffered from hematoma, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for still unknown cause," as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the word "yes" on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been eligible for them, Kahrs had previously said the "Bild" newspaper.
"When we get married, it's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman of the SPD Bundestag Group and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening up of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had made a stir on June 30, 2017 with a vile speech.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Shabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexual couples.
They had previously been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters of hedges cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Bürgerverein Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
Because about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfaldner house should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about 12 supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce the costs," said the chairman of the citizens' association Walter Schröer.
And there have also been so many things gathered.
Because of the hot summer, we're late this time, but fortunately it's just a shape.
Because in the spring the hedges had already been shredded.
The breakfast that is always following the work has also been a long tradition.
"Everyone should be able to remain strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner picks up gold at the Canuslalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old took a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympic track.
Two years ago, he had missed the Olympic bronze by three hundred-second.
I was well prepared, already had enough rides here at the plant and it was all right today, "said the Olympic third of London in 2012.
In the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and put both arms up to the top - knowing well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting reports the first attempt to break into a single-family house this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglar people want to use.
So the police inspection Gauting reported yesterday the first attempt to break into this autumn.
The fact that it remained on the Königswieser Straße in the attempt at the one-family house is due to the alarm system.
It started when the offenders put their hands on Friday, just before 8: 00.
The burglars knew that the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm system surprised them, however, so that they took the escape without a prey.
Information to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Broken at Hertha: Received from reality: Bavaria challenged against Ajax
The title is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin is "not going to let itself be" by the FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance delle under the new coach Niko Kovac should not in any way increase to the larger autumn depth for the Munich.
"A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has come to us, "said Thomas Müller after the earned 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know we're really upset, and that's why we're going to go to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal has been shot outside, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table lead in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berlin through their playful conifers over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last-looking Bavaria are to crack.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we do not like it and we will do everything we can to make us successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his birthplace and his first defeat as Munich coach only pushed on the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term of office positive - otherwise the sound is likely to get worse.
Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second king-class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second round against Ajax, which had also taken AEK Athens to the start, begins as planned.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes in the back," said the 23-year-old, just before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavaria even lay behind Dortmund with five meters, which has now taken over the top with one point.
And so Kimmich, with a wink of eyes, at least looked positive, that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the line of the association.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the authority of interpretation in the long-term issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President, at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, strongly criticised the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany, the DFB head defended the line of the association.
In the early Sunday morning, the grindle personally attacked by Özil announced the consequences of the Causa at the ZDF- "Sport Studio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we must draw very close conclusions that such a thing does not repeat itself," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan did not support the values of football and the DFB.
He had denounced in sharp words a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they have taken pictures with me in England, "Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as her president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who went up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil after the World Cup affair, which had taken its start from photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt "treated sensibly by the DFB."

That someone says, if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
But he does not see a basis for a return of Özil to the national team either.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration representative is to be appointed.
"If one of them has a clear impact on society and football without a background of migration, and says:" The subject is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel.
In spite of the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he intends to re-run for office as the DFB President next year.
"I do my job and I try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10: 00 and 1: 00.
The 75-year-old driver was first approached by a lady at the red light in the area of Lüterer Höhe.
She told the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of persons, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, a telephone message was received from the police about a car driver who would have gone off the road and driven against a leading post.
In response, the man did not want a local police and then drove away.
After that, the rodent went home.
However, in his place of residence in which he has been living for decades, the pensioner has taken action and a construction vehicle has been rampant when turning.
After all, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had a lot of accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a strange impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is about 1300 Euro.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 forces in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moorfire on a federal defence site in Emsland, 980 forces are still working on the work of the fire.
The Bundeswehr reported that on Sunday.
As a speaker says the situation is still stable, 70 volunteers were last withdrawn.
It is said that a further reduction in the number of forces is planned.
On the night of Sunday an underground fire had been discovered and deleted.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was proclaimed a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames would put at risk the forests and settlements adjacent to the wind and the radio.
On Thursday it was then said that a fire attack on adjacent communities would no longer threaten.
At times more than 1500 forces tried to get the big fire under control on the ground.
The Luftwaffe further supports the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire had been triggered by testrakets that had fired Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was at times up to a hundred kilometres far across the north-west of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that will receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by Hoteliers and holiday owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the word "yes" on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been eligible for them, Kahrs had previously said the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, it's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman of the SPD Bundestag Group and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening up of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had made a stir on June 30, 2017 with a vile speech.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Shabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexual couples.
They had previously been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the highly expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province, the neighbour of Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked every approach of Skopje to the EU and the Nato for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote in favour, they will also give the start for the western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1986 dies in the USA in 2016 and leaves a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions can continue to be taken only with express consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in case of need from Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, institutions can continue to be taken only with express consent, says Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Almer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the decisive moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the family do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You will then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," said Almer.
A similar registration system exists in the UK.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per or against organ donation -," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered as organ donor, unless he or his or her members were opposed.
The Catholic Church, among other things, rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in the head count.
He was in Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 co-leaders.
Martina Flame-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, told us on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of a 74-year-old retired from France, as the main judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
To date, for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As the audience was not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants took part against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he held a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He's one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was already present two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or miracle child, the organizer Lue can do little.
"The head count can be trained," he said.
Many participants took part in several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadiums-oriented computing competitions.
One of the disciplines is, for example, the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating diversity, the candidates get a surprise job, for which they have to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here too the Germans would have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because in early childhood, head-counting is learned there more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Urgent appeal: Video with nude Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams is on her emotional and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer and make herself strong for early detection.
It's about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps had been discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow on the mountains in the west
Next week in the West, Mrs Holle will shake out her beds for the first time: polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week is down to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could cut down at a high intensity to about 1,000 meters, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, it is expected to be 20 to 40 cm new snow above 2,000 meters.
On higher-lying pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlosass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore winter.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual knitting on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual care on Monday.
The "green walls" that are unique in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and shredding hedges up to five metres wide are "forest set" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect areas scattered as corridors, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and animal fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their specialist workshops.
His name "Knick" is also from that time: the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop by "changing" the branches.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, about 45 000 kilometres of hedges extend and give the image of a wooded, diverse structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 species as a replacement habitat.
In one kilometre of the Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and grow up to 30 bird pairs.
However, the Knick can only perform its ecologically important function if it is maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he spurred to a light tree line, which in addition to biodiversity also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knitting may only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about sanitation on site
In the interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND), the local radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta at the time on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have set up something temporary, where we have other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on the surrounding hills, on which they are still waiting for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people stay in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many food shops and also the gas stations are completely closed, people are partly stealing food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners run around in part free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information provision on the island going?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but it didn't work before, and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people, who do not know whether they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions, which were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami met the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi lying on the Pacific fire ring not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against becoming: VfB must give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday, Aogo had drawn a muscle fibre tear in the back left thigh at the 2: 1 against Werder Bremen, the football-Bundesligist announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following country break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals up within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibre tear usually heals up a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebátian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The film festival of San Sebastián is the annual end of the most prestigious European festivals.
In spite of all the songs on the cinema, it is possible to sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice, which was able to draw a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the fire brigade Olching tried to catch an injured duck.
The action, however, took some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - A white, injured duck appeared on Sunday morning on Lake Olchinger.
She was in the area of the water guard station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire department could circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman with a warm handle after almost an hour.
The duck injured on the chest was then taken to the animal hospital of the LMU to Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.

In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Pyeongchang Olympic Sprint the medal close to the grip.
Seven tenths of seconds were missing in the end on bronze.
"I have deliberately taken the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a big event with the Constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to strike too.
The WM-Loope in Östersund (SWE) is located Eberhard: "I have already closed the line in the heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race in the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass stage competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in the Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interviews is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the contentious judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators until Friday to investigate the suspected incidents over 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama of the vocation of Kavanaugh, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was launched on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the jurist cast angry tirades against the opposition democrats, the Senate's judicial committee should set the way for the final confirmation of the first conservative judge at the US Supreme Court.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly said, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but asked for an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still referred to the heavy attitude on Thursday as "a sham," first contained further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, final doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, in an election rally, Trump strongly attacked the Democrats because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One would specifically examine the well-known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative told the "Wall Street Journal": "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for the monitoring of the Tempolimit is located on the garden road from Monday, October 1, according to the municipality.
There is also the Bundesschulzentrum.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website * Official website
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, the factor time played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football games.
It was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room, "said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the King's Blue had managed to bring the little 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and with it the first victory of the season under the roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security, Tedesco: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing." As the playing time increased, the head obviously played more and more a role.
Don't actually create a head-ball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, and so they were still retreating.
And defend with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Kupf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make it a fireworks," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest ankle of the afternoon: King Blue missed it to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a tremor victory," said Tedesco: "You have already felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only control man.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometres away a hiker in the Leitzachtal on Sunday around 1.30 pm observed a fire.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out about the police and the fire department: an unknown had burned garbage on a two square meter surface at the Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the heat unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fishbachau fire brigades were busy disconnecting and deleting.
The police are investigating arson now.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
The author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani, is in front of them.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for the time being.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years now," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the Alliance "Cultural Policy" in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, firm numbers and one or the other joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most controversial themes: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
The German society is sitting at a table, and the first generation migrants are sitting at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always been at the big table and want to take part.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not important whether one is politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he stresses.
In the beginning, it is more likely to behave, then the round of discussions is starting to get more and more excited.
And there is a need to speak.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is in front, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the following signing, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, was discussed intensively.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away victory.
Gießen was in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91: 84 (43: 46) against the Mitteldeutsche BC.
The ambitious bonners won at the BG Göttingen at 86: 79 (49: 47).
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112: 55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season the German master Bayern Munich and the former serial master Bose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already worked on Friday for a 83: 77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg at 84: 80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 land
The need is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new building area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick tells you.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 land that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices, similar to the previous home-based model.
A good 100 applications had been received, said Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined," with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Plieninger mayor, the aim was to have the candidate list for the 20 land by the end of the year and to present it to the municipal council.
The award could then be made.
A total of 50 land for single and double houses is created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with expected eight housing units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and paths will be paved in the near future.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 land in a socially-compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as a affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
The area of the new building area of Landsham-Süd is estimated to have a living area of about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new building of a day care centre is taking place there.
It will include three nursery and three nativity groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next year of kindergarten.
This is how Schalke's naldo "big sport" succeeds in the bank
For the third time in a row, not in the start: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been sitting for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian, almost two-metre-tall, had really talked about the soul's frustration.
But when the Schalker players, after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, gathered in the middle circle as usual and thanked the chief coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom all call for simple Naldo, turned on and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," later Tedesco said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his re-existence, did not have any grudge.
Problích knows Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best switch, that he actually did not get on the stop track with his coach - but for good reasons gets a break.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco told us about the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the start.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club, "Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can go through it at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation that finally caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by showing himself also on the bank as a model team player.
The mood in Austria's industry has continued in August to accelerate its downhill ride compared to the euro-zone.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month level.
However, Austria has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, and the Markit Institute reported on Monday on its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, while the PMI of the euro area increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th consecutive month below the mark of 50 meters, which suggests growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March, with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains - in the third quarter at least - the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area were no longer as strong as in November 2011.

The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.

In France, the last time, the Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar brought PSG into the lead after 22 minutes and made the final in the post-season.
In the meantime, Christopher Nkunku (46.) took care of the 2-0.
This also enabled Paris to take the general test for the leading second Champions League group game against Red Stern Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the king's class, Tuchels had to take the only mandatory defeat in this season at the 2-3 in Liverpool.
