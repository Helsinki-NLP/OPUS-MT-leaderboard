Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economic nation.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a treaty for defence cooperation between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunt
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver drove it at 125 km / h in a 70 km / h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km / h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued to drive on Burgess Road before he went to the bush country, where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accused a 20-year-old man of not respecting a stop signal and ruthless driving.
He is to appear in the District Court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of rape a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and could not signal an agreement."
Webster is also accused of having raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Referring to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put forward a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as citizens' rights.
"As trade unions die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice-president of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
I therefore proudly present the Staff Authorization Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as on other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law Act, in order to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation, to sue a civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or penalty payments - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not in accordance with American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have been exposed to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries around the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the role played by workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the need for the workers to organize themselves and to raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to set up associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements which restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void, and the measures to be taken are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions for the protection of their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to set up a trade union - and that this trade union was then allowed to take part in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government bodies - had to be protected.
After these rights have been put under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to see the American ideal again, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history keeps them.
The story remembers, and we should do the same.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and have redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close down
A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped implementing a law in Louisiana on Sunday, saying that it would probably have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, which was brought into law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who do abortions to acquire a patient's right to take up a hospital within a 30-mile radius in order to acquire their practice.
The judge's decision, however, means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be held for the judge in order to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Regrettably welcomed the decision, the most recent in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would take so much time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are missing a disgraceful law that wants to take away their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Reproductive Rights Centre, who had complained on behalf of three of the five hospitals in the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also covered the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and also applied for the right of establishment.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the state's remaining clinics to close down were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Proponents of abortion and the American College of Ostetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that the right of initiation of doctors requires unnecessary restrictions.
Disclaimers are opposed to the fact that the measures are designed to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of hospitals.
Only a doctor who is doing abortions in Louisiana has patients' rights of initiation, informed the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to do no more abortions, this doctor would no longer do the operation for fear of his safety, said the group.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their applications for patients' rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video message online for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
There is a higher risk for women in the rural areas of Australia to die of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women who found ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent of them were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
The research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIE: New medicines could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-diseases, and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres than possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologues, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of the telemedicine services in order to counter the distances, it proposed, as a possible remedy, a strengthening of the service of experienced doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to more closely provide women with their home, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer, regardless of geographical status, and stressed the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret falling home owner numbers
The decline, along with an increased fall in the number of house owners under 35, could lead to garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products" according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people with their own homes spend on their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalt the front gardens for parking purposes, and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion is put into sale each year.
In the Greater London area, where the share of house owners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Adviser for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to increasing home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of better weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have stormed the state television station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now sending again.
At the same time, about 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away they provided themselves with sticks and stones equipped clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators called for Sharif's resignation, but the latter rejected it.
In the meantime, the country's army is calling for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using it without violence."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night, the military said: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The military has played an important role in Pakistan and has already been a major contributor.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accused Premier Sharif of cheating on him in the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to go to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for spy report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's oldest US diplomat to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major activity area for the US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
A previous report that the most important secret service of Germany, Ankara, was also targeted, led to significantly more irritating reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Lokführer threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger transport in NRW.
The stand announced for 6 to 9 pm concerns all transport companies throughout the country, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

Sven Schmitte, the district president of the German Lokomotive führer (GDL) union, said in Düsseldorf.
We're expecting significant failures.
There were no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Chief of Police of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the Majorca Public Prosecutor's Office.
The head of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and cash owners in the notorious Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most of the bars and nightclubs of Magalif are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Malorca Anti-Corruption Office on Friday.
Two other local politicians were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the authorities' nepotism has a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
This summer, due to a viral YouTube video, Magaluf made international headlines showing a 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during a drinking tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the unregulated behaviour of alcoholic vacations in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcoholic pubs.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage have to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000) together.
The tourist village of Magaluf, which is popular with young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "Balconing," where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
The FRÜHLING has brought a winter surprise to South Australia, with heavy showers and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9: 00 p.m., a further 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down at night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy shears, including a cast that started just before 8: 00 p.m. and provided for almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell back on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C.
The bad weather has probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30, but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to go through.
At that time, the winds reached about 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to go through with a second landing and finally set up at about 8.40.
The flight delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthes thinks: Highest time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switching centres, our columnist Bernd Matthes is comforting himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my look at the spiral cable that connects the phone to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there is a thought behind it: if the cable were not, in a short time all the listeners would fly around the house without a hand, and that would be even more retro.
In any case, is it true on the eceltronic (eceltronic)?
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that today's world news is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - out of date.
And for example, if you still have a tube TV in the living room today, you only say that you are opposed to television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because this week, the Ifa's pressure on the radio tower again shows us our absolute incompetence in the field of electronics.
The layman, who used to be blind in the washing machine and CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread in front of him with unbelievably vain expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you all right?
What do you want to talk about with people who seem to be volunteering to spread such a quark?
In fact, for about 20 years we have been talking about the fact that we should network our house.
So that the yogurt can reorder itself, so that the fire detector will tell us on vacation on the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we had the air conditioning from the office on our early arrival...?
Yes, it requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: we lift our wristwatch, tell her loud "sucking!" - and at home the vacuum robot starts.
Crazy.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are fading," an industry connoisseur, you can connect the washing machine with a headset, the steam-maker sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza in the oven still takes, which is no use, because we are in the jam.
We also know from the daily practice: If a new-modified device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday, after spending the summer in air-raid rooms, while rocket and mortar fire on their communities took place during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel, marked by rocket fire holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident in the Kibbutz Saad and a local English teacher.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little weird" to go back to school suddenly.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of people of the border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Her children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border city with Gaza, which is hard to draw from the Palestinian fire.
He called on the children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for Hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies to be handed over by two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to the estimates of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the people killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people were looking for refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected areas and the fighting continues, last week the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Saxony: CDU-Vice Strobl calls into question NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-BundesVice Thomas Strobl has spoken out in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU-BundesVice Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts off worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also head of the CDU country in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipzig People's Newspaper."
This is a positive development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD had just failed at the five-percent hurdle.
A first attempt to ban the right-wing extreme party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at the time had informants in the NPD top.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the Neulanden Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The first central reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting from all the seams.
Now the inside office has put three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were informed just before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hausruck actions further raise citizens' reservations and do not give district politicians the opportunity to work constructively in the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Green Group in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the Harburg district administration currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for overfilling the initial intake are the surge of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough space in the following facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have seen the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread over the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, but in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased on average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices increased only by 1.4% over the year.
Mr Lawless also said that with the start of the spring, there would now be an increase in the real estate for sale for the next few months, which would be "a real test" on the market.
"Looking at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will increase further over the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to him to pose "like a master of the field."
This is not the style of the university, it is said in the communication.
In the middle of June, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the university's intentions.
The statement that the plans only became known in July is definitely wrong, "said Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "pre-defined or even decisions," but that they were "preferences."
The necessary extension of the narrow road up to the castle for access was also less dramatic than was feared by the Medaus.
There was and is not a talk of a nine-metre-wide road.
According to the current level, it is about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before, "explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-run parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
There is no parking at all, because this can now be done intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the residents
According to the President of the University, the children's crib, which is located on the grounds and which would lead the entrance to the park deck in front of the front door, should not be "affected."
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the children's crèche, but also about the residents at the entrance to the Friedrich-Strieb-Straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
It is therefore a matter of much more than of the special interests of Mr Medau, "said Mr Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' council of the children's crèche, with the extension of the road would be entitled "one of the few natural spots of Coburg would be lost," "the reader can decide himself."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the state building office Bamberg, wants to inform the city council about the construction development of the university by 2020 "and in this context to address the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's crib last week about the plans of the university.
According to this, the access to the new park deck is not to be taken over the campus and the Friedrich-Strieb-Straße, but rather over the Medau-Berg.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended two-lane in about one kilometre length.
According to the projections of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus increase ten times.
There are about 2000 vehicles a day.
The city did not wish to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf retires from the national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesliga club SG Flensburg-Handewitt mainly mentioned health problems for this decision.
I did not like the decision, it has matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team, "said the World Champion of 2007 on his Facebook page.
It is therefore going to the international retirement with a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the huge back-up player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go for a few more years on the road, he is now no longer available to the new German trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation with the Icelandic, who announced his squad for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they will also inspire my long-standing fellow players and my successors.
But for my club, I would like to be available in the next few years in a healthy way, for which longer periods of regeneration are needed, which does not allow the current double load.
The left-handed had to fear his career in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles' problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later had caused a strong inflammation.
One emergency operation and two other operations followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass by any body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot surgery, which took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
To this end, there are some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that I can control my head, but I can't fool my body, "Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine" Handball Time. "
He would only be available for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes are torn, I am always ready to talk," said the two-time family father to the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball in one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble about my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 win of the Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).

German economy shrank by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment fell.
External trade also slowed the economy.
The strong annual start-up results in a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent for the first half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "Münsterland-Mooist," which first led through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer."
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
This was the largest cycle tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various technical journals.
We come from The Helder and went overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way too, "the cyclists were happy about the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace journey" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was written for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz, over the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On lines of 95 kilometres with 1175 meters of height, 120 kilometres with 1475 meters of height and 145 kilometres with 1775 meters of height, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were served on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor representatives Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization was running without problems and there were no negative events, "Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"In 2015 we will see each other again in the hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," but the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's unrelentlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, has put on paper in "monk and warrior" on 287 pages.
The Munich-born on June 1, 1947, not chronologically, but more thought-creeps have written down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is mercilessly honest: from the Onanie as a high school to the shop theft and drug use, he does not miss any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also takes abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of this he tries to go to the bottom in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and how not only the music has shaped him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebeman Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is born "by subtraction," as he says, "by leaving away everything unnecessary."
But between all these highly spiritual views there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example, about rackets in a restaurant frequented by Gis or a crazy car ride, where he planned a tree on the front.
He is unrelentlessly honest, too.
Lenny Henry: My father never took my arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult moments of childhood.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A lot of my life, he was that serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's times, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep stylish labyrinth with flammenschuten and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could hear him sing, because he could wash the foundry of himself.
When I was walking around there, I realized that he had done this for years to put the food on the table, and my respect for him became greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimonies.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was ill towards the end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I did this fitness thing and I had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes carrots.
Henry's career change may be in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken in by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator / comedian on TV for a quite long time."
He studied in a job.
I had to grow up not only in front of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, to learn how to become an efficient joke-telling machine, while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right on the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted on black," Henry performed his comedy there for five years.
It was very unpleasant to my family.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I'm not sorry I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But this "award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was released in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing the time around or walking a little bit on the spot?"
After that, a documentary series for Radio 4, entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I never really learned anything about him at school, and I thought he was mostly a middle class domain, white in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All the people we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head on.
"That's what this is about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
You seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of mischief.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me," You have to bridge over 10 minutes while they repair the computer. "
Instead, the stage leader announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
This too came well, so it's like a great sign of the gods who tell me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERDEN voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through humorous outbursts while he always imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is kind of dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're going to be in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I feel like it, but I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he's ever gonna do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Hathi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi's followers had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman of the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah."
The access to Parliament had also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post," Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday night.
According to the paper, Hushi threatened with a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite huthis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni-ruled Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The people's tribe of Huthi has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access routes of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there are always bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
Kenya records officials to contain "ghost workers"
Kenya has started to register all state officials biometrically in order to delete "ghost workers" from the government's paylists.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still be paid after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
A review at the beginning of this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost in payments for "ghost workers" and by other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reported Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, was reported in a government message.
All those who did not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"This approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also by cleaning the pay list at both levels of government -" the "spirit workers" will be eliminated, "said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal about the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be negotiated for the first time in court on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million euros of damages from Achenbach in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
That's what a court spokesperson told me on Monday.
The application states that Achenbach has cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and Berthold Albrecht has calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach had bought valuables for EUR 121 million for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was in the school service for 44 years, of which 23 were head of the school.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many settled Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his desire to see the human being in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was already interested in the teacher's profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their house.
After a few months in a camp we went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
This is how the judge went to the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Richter had to run six times a week to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the city to school and go back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he made the first and in 1954, after three years of teaching, the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he moved to the newly built teacher's house next to the school for a three-room apartment.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968-69 school year, these were combined in Petershausen in the present-day town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain the present building from September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Judge's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the community, also had a work room and cellar rooms built during the 1997 enlargement, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a lecture by a school council on law and justice: "One must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old.
And he had to know: "This is not always a success." Whether he only means his students or his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students were in a fight, they did not get a criminal job from him, nor were they thunder for detention.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves created and let the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the benefit of the school, Richter, as rector, maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, the court moved the party-free judge to at least be the last to run for the municipal council on the CSU list in 1996.
However, Richter was ranked sixth and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists set up in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scotten stops
If Radler is taking a rest on her tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, that's nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the only impression was that the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour and the accompanying tros enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
The participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig."
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, the 60 km over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had taken part in Bad Vilbel by bike, and the head of the private business of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of the body and the spirit, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ransstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had made 85 sheets of apple, shrubs, shrubs and cheese cakes, which were a wonderful mundane to the good cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake rural women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised, while he ordered another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the drink stand of the Geiß-Nidda club.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operetta and musicals and gained enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He has earned it, after all, he has already refixed the bike chains that have already been blown out today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking spa by reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Also the head of the promotion, Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-bike tour in 2004 as a tour guide, was only able to snow for a short time, he had a lot to do with the technology on the ground.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle team to the Hessen police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a little on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa, when they left after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say good-bye.
After the arrival in Scots, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festambiente and of course, they had prepared treats, such as flammcake with well-cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS managing director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as member of the board of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were clearly pleased with the "many plant in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for swinging under the open sky was used eagerly despite the sporting activity on the bike.
The guests were increasingly mixed with citizens, who were just as pleased with the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 km of radelns, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on the basis of the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reported local media agencies.
The police authorities did not make a direct comment.
Among the prisoners are 14 high-ranking police, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping into telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by the Islamist clerical Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slavyansk, visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be restored here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It arrives with a proud tower of glory from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
She started her career with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., and then moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top post of the Pearsons parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation was supposed to be almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet consultant.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
As early as May, I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inward to the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This provides for an almost untenable duopol, which requires a complete and comprehensive reform.
But what new-coming chairman would risk taking on everything and disintegrating an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps killing himself for his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC smaller - power, money and status overtaken.
While the competition is closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the forthcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is particularly dangerous.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world's most important media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households, each of which costs only 40 pence a day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found him.
Perry from Texas says that degrading tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a degrading remark about the democratic district attorney, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one from Perry's user account, which denied the previous one.
Just a tweet was sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I do not approve of the tweet and I have deleted it," it was said in the later news.
Perry staff did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets were based on Perry's official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavorable image of the District Attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, who was sentenced in April 2013 for drunkenness at the tax.
Perry put in a veto against financial support for her office when she refused to resign, which led to an indictment against Perry - possibly a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet is, "I don't always drive drunk with the three times the permitted alcohol level... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry with spitting it out."
I'm the most drunk democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio Special Prosecutor, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal advisers requested the case-by-case judge to reject the charge and argued that the law that is used against the most senior governor in the history of the State of Texas is unmistakably diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state money to the State's Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County, in cases of state corruption in Texas, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto led to a public complaint by a left-standing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he finished fifth at the Iowa election meetings during his presidential candidacy in 2012, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"
Berkeley resigns "normal" housing market
One of the most prominent construction contractors in London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had "returned" to normal level.
Own homes in the capital were hot-coveted and the subject of huge price increases, which the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, had to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "stable action environment."
The real estate market in London was well established during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Bureau, prices in the city area have risen by 18.5% in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, low-cost and student offers increased by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April by £423.000.
A stronger pound, however, has made property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been discouraged by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "villa tax" before the general elections in May.
Last week, the London real estate agent Foxtons warned that the Mortgage Market Report for April, which presented more stringent lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in the case of real estate sales and in the case of prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the mortgage clearance in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on a already weakening home price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now decreased by a quarter year after year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for the sale of the time are more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the time sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 percent per year to £280 million, and sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the current year's revenue for Berkeley is expected to be in line with current market expectations.
The analysts agree that the annual pre-tax result is £450 million.
Berkeley shares in London were fixed at £23.96 in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence's performance at the 85th Oscar Ceremony.
Naked photos of the Oscar award winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images from another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and accused the hacker of "blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan, were allegedly obtained by a gap in the iCloud online storage system by Apple. BuzzFeed reported the alleged "master list" of the hacking victims, including the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you are really happy with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victorian" denied, however, that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are GEFÄLSCHT, people.
Let's just avoid the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesperson of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J."
It was the best way to describe it, they were slowly dissolving like a box that was left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distanced, and maybe a little scratchy.
And shook his hand.
He knew scratching.
He was prickly, like in hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this insolence was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailin Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a land in a moist but Paradise valley with the name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaking, in the bathrooms were still spiders, nudges had left their traces on all the windows and believed that all this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a children's tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had clapped in the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and dazzling news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to during closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolised, just as the word obsolized.
The general taste of what decrees and regulations had never done, and how people choose the Vom-Tellschüscher-zum-Millionär-Memoirs, cookbooks and love novels in books, so they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a rough-funny serenade of Ailin's big feet.
Ailin didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That's what his father had always done to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game at that time, and it was not very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailin had never heard of any of them.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without hearing about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailyn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A conformal society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared by fate.
People of African-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as they were by nature and were taken care of with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewer; what was left of the Greeks, they smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WAS WAR, WEN IT WAR, for fear of being charged for fire-fighting, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha Pfeifen restaurants, kept in mind and were depressed with the inaction.
Each according to his own abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailin to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be reduced.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge kale-like leaves.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why would your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was a little strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head and shook Keverner's sight.
There was nothing else to see all over the world but her uncombed, raven black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not that direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little pervert.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm that was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailin Solomons became red and rose out of her deckchair, threw over the console and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblossoms, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her arousal she seemed to tremble, like palm wedge in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more dignified according to THE WAS than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, always moved from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or moved to them.
Big head?
They would have shown her a big fist if she didn't watch out!
They first cuddle - cuddling was the most used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the non-saying love ballads from the console - they first cuddle and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knitting itself was already an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt to remain, but the strength of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She watched him go away - just as her companion saw him from a room on the upper floor - a man, complained by something he himself had called up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a spirit of battle - why was that a sight that she seemed to know well when she could not remember a single time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailin Solomon looked at her feet.
A few years before the events that have just been reported, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a brief presentation of the continued low and medium-level violence in precisely the parts of the country where the reduction, if not abolition, will most likely be expected, in view of the funds and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence.
"A lot has been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people, which has led a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness was rarely felt historically despite the high rise of church towers between the hedges.
But some properties turn out to be inexorcable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion that it continues to arouse.
The population weeps when listening to sentimental ballads, is intoxicated by stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former raw material hold the rural communities in hand, as well as our urban fabric, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious desire to fight at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said their mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nutsbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and refused to give the statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a case-free job.
We serve a non-prejudicial society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in itself absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "insidious" and "raw," could be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue to ride on what is happening, if it is seen as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the country's essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, value your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the song is better than writing, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you're going to get at," answered Esme Nussbaum with a quiet voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the way in which we repeat the mistakes that have been made in the first place, when it has been made.
This time, however, it is not the others that we take out our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To suggest an angel's patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call acts" mistakes "that our grandparents may have committed or not.
You also go too far when you talk about the fact that they have left out their "anger" and their "mistrust" to "others."
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are not talking about "us" and "others" in the understanding of the past as well as in the protection of the present.
There was no "we" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to say, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as no debt has to be assigned, no debt has to be repaid if such an eradication is appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate it.
But what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past is for us to forget it.
If there's anything I can say...
Luther Rabinowitz dropped his pyramid.
"I will remember their report," he said and released them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had taken a kind of "brutal anger" on the road.
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho denied having planned a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said that they were going against police officers accused of armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded his home and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to adjacent South Africa after reporting on the assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup d'état, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armed forces were imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defence forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports, that within the police some elements were actually working to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a fall.
"Although no one has claimed to have taken the government by force, all the reports agree that the activities of the defence forces of Lesotho have so far shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice-Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said that he believed he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his single government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, in spite of other charges.
Production in the euro-zone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the euro-zone slowed down in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, with a closely observed study.
The final Markit purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders have fallen and factories have experienced bursts in a period of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will be available before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery of the euro area and for threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during the course of this week as to whether he would consider a quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with the one made by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slow effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, the leading economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, the PMI fell to 46.9 in the second largest economic nation of the block, France.
France remains a child of care, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
The evidence that growth incentives no longer apply in the key industrial mechanism of Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands is also not reassuring, "said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to lead to the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry in the euro area in August is that the sector will continue to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are increasing uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to lead to some contracts being delayed or even cancelled, in particular large-scale contracts.
He said that it was "more and more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to launch a type of QE, "although we suspect that this would be limited."
The century of hell of the survivors of Beslan: ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in South Drusland.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom at the Greueltat.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan School, where 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, the heroic survivors warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abhorrence, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the time of the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now haunting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now ending.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back into the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back into the broken school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some pomegranates are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people, as was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, even though the memory becomes somewhat weak every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online, as I climb back to school, I think that for the first time many people see it, understand our disaster, and help to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
With fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw a weeping little child on the way, took it by the hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who closed his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I could not save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and had leg injuries in the hospital, in turn assuming that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I wept with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
He was later flown to London (from the now disbanded newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it's going to be more pale in my memory.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes, and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid of going back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, who didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a top-open car.
But now he is afraid for place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends have suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they will take me to the school academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting she and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at them with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now continuing, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like ours.
I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he's not looking for revenge, he's not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they go to the sports hall and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember when he sometimes sat on the sofa, turned his face off from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys, which now is 17, bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him," Damir, run, run, run, run, "but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin and his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-flooded face was drawn with fear when he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she hurried to take her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date goes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget, I promise.
Urgent: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in our home in the bookcase.
I understand that, but I also think that, thanks to this image, people all over the world feel our pain.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never knowing the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing at all in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st of September comes closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and I went to a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't let that happen.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Georgij Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Faniyev was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and after that I actually felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's secret service academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, even the medical ones, and they said it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this and, of course, they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes.
I will go to the commemorative celebrations.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much more violent for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help it.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgij is an adult now, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He's been operated on several occasions, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I would say that he has overcome 50% of the horror, but it can never be completely overcome and forgotten.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and that only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and I've been expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make to me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know about families in which new children were born, but also about widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I almost cannot believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we be fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If we could just grab and throw all these rebels out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskaieva, 10
The baby that was carried so gripping by a special mission in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all
The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in her cruelty, her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar held back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife, Swetlana, that he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, 10 years old today, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of having run over girls on a pedestrian crossing in fife
A 78-year-old man is in court for a three-year-old girl's overrun on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of having hit a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Stewart controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and that the girl was injured.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the accusation in front of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dusty underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD, with which you can compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look at this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So take a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a line mode that makes a number of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you get off the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
It is particularly important for you to work with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthetist, he dedicated his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnosis and disease are important to the doctors, while the most people are concerned with something very different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had a hard time getting ready.
While fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made impatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do it now than later," he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and uneasy.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray test on his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest skin, that is, the skin that overtakes the lungs.
As with most cancer, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material, which was once considered to be a "miracle material" but was now found to be fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to no longer use it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the material - plumbers, construction workers, carpentry and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are now experiencing the fatal effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of the mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protection room.
The Parliament's buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals, where we are to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the source of the disease.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and peers - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my old people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been suffering from Mesotheliom for the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of the diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are going to get sick?"
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to come to a halt, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die like this.

A short look at the files of the courts, to which the parties often turn for damages, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations, one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would concern me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestos form," a description of the fibre structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe isolations, boiler isolations, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and the WHO to be a "major health risk" with possible consequences for death.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (krokydolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are clear but indirect indications that this was a major reason for the unique high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alam at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London, asbestos
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual.
He has presented a study of those concerned, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma, without known suspension, was caused by work or in the home probably by asbestos contact in the environment."
In his opinion, a large part of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unknowingly exposed to the substance even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos behind Parliament's committee rooms, the deadly fibres of which could be raised by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Department of the Parliamentary Employment Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work must be spent over several years in order to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet more at the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've been working and the data.
What he remembers exactly is the day in early December 2009, when he got some kind of fever.
He was 45, and he did an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was from the chest skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays from his chest and used pleuracathethers to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without a diagnosis.
His health improved slowly and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after exercise and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his home doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going, "he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
All of a sudden, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended that he take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very common, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many of the employees who had been eating in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It is clear that, over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students turned off their bunsenburners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties, asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their bunsenburners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed.
And in the meantime, such innocent objects in our houses as floor plates or dandruff roofs have by default included asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a woman had to make was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you rip off your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and I tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor," how long do I have? "
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it. "
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibres are inhaled, they can be stuck in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-chest doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital that Andrew Lawson thinks he's exposed to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It's invasive from the very beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, highly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure doesn't.
"You can't cut out the chest skin," he says.
You can't get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advisory office for those affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he was happy when he called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years before and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and would probably only extend his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be transferred, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and would have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many of the people concerned are of another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that one realized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full compensation," because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients who seek compensation, it is an enormous problem to assign the fatal asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who fight against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there have been clear new legislation this year which makes it easier for mesothelioma-affected people to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a fund of £350 million supported by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 to prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80% of what a court could have given them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications to the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesotheliom people, thinks that £350 million was a "very good work" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not gone away and Mesotheliom's patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven victims of death, it was necessary to act quickly every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expected to have a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
You can always see that in patients.
There's something that will keep you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.

At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
After-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's life-ending.

Now no trace of the tumours is visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very exhausting.
You have to think of practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or to show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I wouldn't get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and untempered.
She told her friends, and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomist patients, such conversations have not been carried through by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as in the end also for Stephen Jay Gould) provides a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach is likely to fire the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists launched the planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said right-wing expert Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have its inhabitants elected to the government in 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because the citizens of Hong Kong have a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is holding the process firmly in hand by a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing.
A new clause is also intended to allow only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests have taken place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to cut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters within hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and that they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation of the central area only as a last resort, an action to be taken only if all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central area will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and there were increased security measures, including police forces and barricades, on Sunday in front of the government building.
The riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
The fear is also growing that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are starting to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, as it was a threat to the business - the life-of-the-world of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said right-wing expert Regine Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to raise any fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 750,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school-leaving balls in the United States is now being transferred to the universities where Freshmen are offered to perform with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxury UK travel service for today's students.
In order to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a security section.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
One company spokesperson said that there were no new bookings, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
The National Student Union, however, criticised the service as being withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NIS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are faced with a crisis in the cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and grants do not keep up with the much-increasing bills for the simplest basis of living before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as the arrival in the student's home.
Feminists criticise racial issue and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put the gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and were observed throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women were 100% around the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts to Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I do not think that in feminism you can find many people who are white and speak privileges in such a high-quality way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For the English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women are exposed to every day, but which are not considered as "women's issues" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynchmurder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's right to vote like Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or black.
"They made the decision to support the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for black people should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade to organize white women against the lynch in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catch" with the problems black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists, who have such traditional feminist platforms, took the right to education as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second-generation feminists, who built their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinen went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a posted article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian's columnist, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race, which are clearly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," Steinen wrote.
Although Steinen stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial issues as well as gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on the racial issue in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to her previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steines.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is in the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is also on the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to reform immigration, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an essential theme for women, they only need to publish the stories of immigration.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of the work visa goes to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a sustainability in women's organisations," she said.
"Pigs house" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
One of the details was a picture of the house's living room - one of which was a pig who had put his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo was, however, published erroneous and has been removed by now," said a company spokesperson.
In the house's exposé, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom one-family house."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The sale of the house was of interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery win
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth continues, with a happy winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years moved the jackpot in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The happy winner, however, still has to get in touch.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit will provide a lot of talk in the small town in the south-west of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could come.
Eight WA winners have celebrated last month's profits in the first division, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had just a few weeks earlier won the $7.5 million mega win.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked in the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood knöcheldeep in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract much more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful rhythms of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian fighter force from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis," which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
The gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and competent presenter and sent his men to the ring for the heroic two-fight in various gladiator engagements.
At first the "provocators" were in turn with a square sign and a short sword, as well as a leg rail on the left leg and a arm rail on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and root flank followed as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius" was particularly impressive, with a throw net, a trident and a dagger against the "Secutor" and after a short fight the boy was hit to the ground.
There the swords clawed metallic together, the shields were shutting and the root flanks were flying through the arena, that a fear and fear could become around the health of the gladiators.
But on them the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experience," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the leisure park became an "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city, as Vice-Mayor Claus Wehage said in his greeting.
After all, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The remains of this were also to be seen on the Roman day, such as "Aqueduct marble" from the 11-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Römerkanal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and for all faced the water and energy supply, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still taking advantage of the knowledge of the time."
This is also confirmed by the diploma-surveying engineer Ralph Saint of the "IngenieanteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who introduced the instruments of surveying the Romans such as chorobat, groma or dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original Hypokauste, the warm air heating, which once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fox two millennia ago in the steps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the "Amt für Bodendenkmalbedienst" had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the "Gewerpark Nord" in Rheinbach.
It was found that the walls of an economic building were covered with a dash for drying cereals and for malting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morschiser.
A number of finds from these excavations were presented in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a petite necklace.
The villa had probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the arrival of the Germanic people in the then Roman Rhineland, Morschiser suspected.
In addition, the children were involved with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or, like the Roman students, they wrote their names with metal handles on growth boards.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, to make glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and to use a heavy wine mill made of stone at the stand of the natural centre of Eifel Nettersheim to ground the flour for a flat bread or a cereal.
With the original Roman travel cars drawn by two cold blooms, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive state of the city high school, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks."
With a week of Rome from 13 to 21 September, the community of Wachtberg will also be involved in the year of the year of the Roman Empire, which is to remind us of the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander Association, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem are offered, among other things, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes and remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell about his work on the future Wachtberg, will present plants as a living monument from the Roman era and will present a funny lesson in the context of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germanen" and the Roman people.
The Adendorfer primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme within the framework of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often not visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be reexperienced.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus a small presentation will remember the find of the Berkum Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic bursts West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest is rotting in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has heavily added to the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic crisis," says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The only thing on the market is who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, and here alone more than 600 people have been killed by the fever.
Recently, the health authorities said that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands of others have been killed.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
All over the resource-rich countries, companies are discharging their operations.
Foreign companies, such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal, are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also react: few merchants still leave their home places to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is getting scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris's expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables would rather stay at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently to feel: food is getting scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic food, such as rice, is declining.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatening an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest risk is that international companies will in principle avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It was important to know how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors could have the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also bursts the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned.
The Moody's rating agency is concerned that their budgets are heavily strained by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Nigeria delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also go back significantly.
Shooters celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year Founding Feast run on high tours from 12 to 14 September.
A big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned on Friday, September 12.
On Saturday, at 6: 00 pm, the big bunker shooting.
The evening of the mood with the "Stoapfälzer Spitbuam" is then in the big festzent.
Blaskapelle provides for the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Festive Service and 9.30 o'clock in the parish church and the great procession at 2 o'clock.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the Bundes- und Gauschißen.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies with their dirndn.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association for "social entertainment through exercise in the room-use and small-caliber shooting" was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again, who on 30 April in the guest house of Lukas raised the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl Mart and Adolf Ried led the club as a protégé master through a difficult initial time, in which it was mainly about finding a club local and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the "Leininger" inn with two teams in the round competition.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized in seven teams, established in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were first reached by Rudi Meier every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club's local "Leininger" has no longer met the requirements of a modern Schützenverein, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgathof Härteis."
After a work of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, Father Strasser gave the ecclesiastical blessing for the new protection rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauschie, combined with the solemn consecration of the new Fahne in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a group of wolves was set up.
Josef Schmalzl became a Böllerreferenteur.
A major challenge for the "Böller" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, last year the club members modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof and thus brought the latest technology to the latest.
Eleven teams in round competition
The sports services of the Schützenverein can also be seen.
A total of 11 teams are currently taking part in the round competition: six air-gun teams, one air-gun team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth team and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann went to the district league 1 in the 2013 / 14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB).
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Gramle has grown from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting, events such as bockstints, fencing and king's ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart is in an accident when he returns to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time, after his right front tyre burst in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we hope we can do better there.
Stewart used to drive into a wall at the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I have come up with quite good hopes today for a good result," said Johnston, adding: "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart failed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver in an ashtray race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had entered the road during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that the investigation to the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart has to expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12. Position, Stewart had already reached the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a new start in round 122, Bushs got
Car number 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which went against the wall.

Dance-joyed young people sought
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to some of the others.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in the TV Jahn also create day-to-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have become very depressed.
Now we are looking for more young people for a sport that is healthy and is great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits," there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," says the 20-year-old.
With more active, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, on Thursdays between 5: 00 and 6: 00 or on Fridays between 5: 30 and 6: 30 in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freisstrasse 9, can go into the training hours without obligation.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," the trainer tells.
After that, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore and classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in the jazz dance.
Of course, the sociability is not too short.
"We are also going to eat, watch dance movies, and we have already stayed in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot more for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dance like this, you can also get into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always take part in children's dance / jazz dance, bambini ballet, video-clip dancing and hip-hop lessons on Wednesdays.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who are interested in disco fox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can look by and join in.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the prison staff union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director-General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov to the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of the employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has given up airport of Luhansk
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the move.
After heavy battles, which were allegedly also involved in Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army has now, Monday, abandoned the airport of the Luhansk rebel stronghold.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without details.
Prisussian separatists shot down the plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters have been shot down again, according to their own representation.
In addition, some 100 soldiers were injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, the insurgents reported on Monday Russian agencies.
Coastguard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the station 112.u.a.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media held Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages in the Donetsk area have been under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all the actors used their performances to make their demands public.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployment in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO was following the 1997 NATO-Russia Council's founding agreement.
The NATO leader, however, accused Russia of "a crackdown" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, "they see us as opponents."
More NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas calls
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
The European Union was still waiting for a decision on whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had arranged between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the supply of gas to Europe.
Europe supplies about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: toll will come "quite clear"
Now the Chancellor is once again clearly committed to this.
But it's not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CDU has been increasingly affected by persistent concerns about car tolls from the CDU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after continuing resistance from her CDU, has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll.
"To be very clear, she is in the coalition treaty, and she will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU leaders in Berlin.
However, for the time being, Merkel did not agree on a detailed model.
In the black-and-red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) had "made a proposal, and this is now being worked on."
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also made a constructive contribution to the discussions on a draft law.
In addition, he had also talked to Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example in broadband development.
"There is nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to pay for motorway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU head Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts in the cabinet against the leading minister.
CDU-BundesVice-President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to be on all the district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU President.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverband Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is concerns that a toll affects small border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for a coalition streak because of the toll criticism from the CDU.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Osnabrück Zeitung" (Monday).
"The Minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which will start in 2016.
However, under the coalition agreement, domestic car owners may not be subject to additional charges.
Therefore, they should be fully compensated for tolls through the car tax.
The model must not, however, be detrimental to foreign drivers by reason of their nationality under EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years, she was going to die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an uncertain course and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich-ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she was in a wheelchair before she was 18, and she died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything took me longer.
I was never able to drive with the other children's roller shoe or skateboard and was often huddled in school because of my way of going and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles' senses and stretch her feet, she saw her medical record when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and was in a terrible panic.
I thought I was gonna be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between, I'm starting to lose all my skills.
I did all this on my own and I planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she realized that her skills had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, or else you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was found.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a.D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireman since the closure of the former troop training place.
For almost ten years now, the former troop training site in Münsingen has not been shot.
However, every month there is still death-causing ammunition at the heart of the Biosphere region of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the ground.
An ear-deafening bang hals over the heart of the biosphere area during the explosions.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was shot at the Münsingen troop training site, which was closed after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Späbische Alb Biosphere, which is open on 13 designated routes for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax revenues for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, such as a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia areas together paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of the companies increased last year by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third year in a row after several years of falling decisions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's income comes from companies.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be also true for the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia together paid over $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes here amount to just over a fifth of the tax revenues of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following is happening: a large part of the real estate, in particular in the D.C. tax area, is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone.
Business revenue also seems to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 per cent at the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
At 6 percent, Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes in all three areas of office (in all three, there are fixed company tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower state and local corporate taxes are required and there is a better overall tax climate than in Maryland.
The study did not study the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the State's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they therefore pay more government and local taxes, as the recent study says.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organised - in the district, Maryland and Virginia, last year, increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a much faster growth rate than the total company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country will probably continue this year, with an increase of 6.2% in general multi-defence tax revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could lag behind if the government's spending reduction has an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the official in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the Vice-Secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, during this week's visit to his city to visit a SPD delegation.
Over and over again, the Chinese ruling Communist Party's official came back to this concern of the 12 million metropolis in the course of the discussion.
Guangzhou, also known as the Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, and is one of the most popular cities in the world.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, promised the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't take much: good water, cereals and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party top in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the Guangzhou official came in with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity order.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-President Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but was cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities is increasing."
At the moment, passengers would have to take the detour over Changsha in Hunan Province, accused Li.
The administration of Guangdong Province, the capital of which is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the air connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese vice-minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodded in agreement.
Maintained partnership
The ludicrous head of Guangzhou's vice-party hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office for allegations of corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is harshly enforced by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new top political leader Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is very unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking up office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top-level member in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9,000 km away Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as all of Hessen with its economic power.
Next year, she wanted to achieve a GDP of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter was hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a message today.
We're all holding our fingers.
According to her mother, on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at a hospital on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, she was sent to Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More stringent environmental standards will be applied to cars and vacuum cleaners that are on the market today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will be provided from 1 September to a label on which the buyer can at a glance see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, the "Euro 6" pollutant class is characterised by sharper nitrogen oxide values.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding workers: they receive a country-wide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 Euro.
Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion-dollar thing, and the cooperation also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," said an insider.
The twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which the best-known (mostly older) games give a paint of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy twitch was taken a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not made, as the company was reported to be willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this right now is this statement by Emmet Sear, President of Twitch: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to exercise than to watch it, it's hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play, rather than even taking control console in their hands.
It's one thing to look over the shoulder of a friend at 3: 00 in the morning while she slips through Resident Evil, and to watch something completely different, to watch a madman get shot in the head 20 times in a row in the call of duty.
You could look at all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headache.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humorvirtuosis, his twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine that twitch is integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men who are being advertised as advertising customers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as an audience sport.
On the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest a lot was going on on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the strong rain cast on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
At times the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was already shown early in the evening, when the first visitors opened up for open air.
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And they did.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and other surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, rattled with the foot in the bar, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and pleasure were called for.
And it's all over the generations.
While one of them was lying on ceilings on the extra-carted white sand at the beach bar, the others were labouring on a quarter of the wine in the Vinothek, the young man was raging on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in the case of child-making, the volunteers had all their hands full in the truest sense of the word, to be able to master the urge and to conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.
The larger ones used the Kickertables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew set up from Salwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30, he was looking for the visitors, especially families looking for the width and the dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
That is why there is nothing to prevent a repetition of the big party next year.
Although it is still necessary to work on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear to the people's voice in a first review on Sunday.
He said that in the meantime the entrance had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
The result: Some who had already paid no longer came to the area.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors, who dawned in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band Blocks'n'Rox therefore unnerved her performance.
The technicians were not able to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to Salwedel because of a tyre flap.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which are still being postponed at the first time, but have to be eliminated at the second edition.
In the social network Facebook, the organizers also have to take criticism.
"Sorry, but you just expected more for 12 euros," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as very close.
I think it's very good that some people not only talk stupid, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hats off!, "Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now the organizers have a year to put off these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark is shrinking
This is not the case as expected.
Instead, the available component is waiting to be used in the striking building.
The action is in the context of a larger action: almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA, the hull, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom with a diameter of 47.5 meters will be a little smaller than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the replacement of the cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is placed on.
If the weather is on the way, the action should go on stage at the beginning of this week.
The participants in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge are getting lost in Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom cried so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge was a painful one.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after she screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she was running out of jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain was so screaming when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was hacked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw it, too, and almost got in my pants with a laugh, but I had to go to the ER.
The 20-year-old from the UK was sent to the hospital to get the jaw back in after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
The castle clubs will soon be on a line again?
In the end, there was always a struggle between the two tungsten-house castle associations.
Now the board of directors are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfenshauer Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfenshauer Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was not a good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfram.
The views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfenshausen Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be quite different.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: discussions on a common approach will be held soon.
The board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of both clubs could move back in the future.
In this way, there were more visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the castle club around Sjöberg the "development and experience" of the site is in the front place.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased, according to his own information, about the call.
He has been in charge of the castle friends since Dimbath died.
A new chairman will be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the association activities rest out of respect." This "phase of thinking" was necessary to "consider how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also take a current picture of the mood within their group.
There is not yet a candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a tungsten house.
The Tölzer wanted to "continue to work on the project."
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl's eyes in the near future.
He commends Dimbath as a "missionary," who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
They are a tourist magnet by the high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I too was sceptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to move the project forward. "It could be a" unique feature "for the city of the river.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitors' tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"I personally do not want to simply throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may be moving a bit on this point.
Their goal of first documenting history is "important and good."
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever ways to save at university textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever spariidea.
He invented a loan system for books from higher-term students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that on average, students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study material, but that there are different cost reduction options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeder are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
The rent of textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much more favourable price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that the rental of text books had doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were rented in the last spring semester, said Neebo's Vice President Tevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookstores.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only a third of the price for which they are to be found in the campus bookstore online.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Cheg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal traces of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold new for $48.
Academists such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended that students ask their professors if previous issues were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be acquired for a fraction of the costs of the latest expenditure.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
The rent of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return them and you do not want to keep the books after the course has been completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms and conditions of the business you are renting, including the penalty fees that may be incurred for writing notes, supporting notes or traces of use.
Tailor: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books are also an option instead of traditional textbooks.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best offers in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I mean, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination of books, as one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not become a cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone recorded less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of his 70 million dollars budget.
The film "Sex Tape" was cut to Cameron Diaz on the opening weekend and only $14.6 million was recorded, while children's films such as "Dragon Tails made easy 2" also disappoint the revenue.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the film itself could be the reason for the children's films.
In 2014, Collin described "the worst year" for children's films and described "dragon teeth made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, in the case of films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic-rating for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvas walls.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disneys' soon-to-be-published Jungle Book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of the Hollywood production, Netflix has recently generated sales with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales were 837 million dollars.
Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios for focusing too much on the film-making of comics and prophesying a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash shackers to be expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in the cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema cup at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the second table tennis district class was deleted to tighten the leagues, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis League has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Those who have not ascended have descended.
In the Oberliga release, Göttingen's highest-class team, Torpedo, has avoided the descent, but only plays fifth-class in the next season.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website * Official website * Official website
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve are in the new association league, in the Landesliga no longer represented Göttingen clubs.

What of the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district football league South.
This is where TSV Seilingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC take part.
In the district league, the regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende play, in the district class of the TTC II, Rot-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district football league of the ladies starts at least in soll strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here.

With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league season of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regionsverband, the two Göttingen roundabout start with nine teams each.
In the West season are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dtransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.

The women's district league consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seilingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no women's teams at all at the circle level.
It is striking that none of the six 2. Circular classes reach the desired strength, here the innovative and moving circle board will have to think about.
Nato Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the centre of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people came together in Cardiff in front of the town hall there to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments on the weekend for us and talked to demonstrators who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers out of the Blue Mountains
Two young bushers were brought to safety with the rope winch after being caught the night over in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man left for their tour in Govett's Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday afternoon.
The police called the police at about 8: 00 when the two had not returned home.
A search party from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11: 00.
The girl had hurt her knee and the man had fallen and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with an ambulance.
Exceling anti-government protests in Pakistan
The about 1000 demonstrators had been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After about half an hour, the transmitter rerecorded the broadcast.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial staff.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the head of government, to whom they are accused of election fraud.
The police reported that about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there had again been clashes of about 3000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to the hospital, a police officer was injured.
During the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to get to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday night after a meeting in the Army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "to be wasted without time and to use it without violence."
The communication also said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has been concerned about the military's intervention, which in the past has already been a more frequent one.
The protests led by the opposition political Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to stay out on Sunday.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," said Khan.
= = References = = = = External links = =
Khan accuses Sharif of having won the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The protesters had at first held their peace in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to go to Sharif's residence this weekend.

With the 2: 0 above Grödig, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday took a pitiful end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the end of the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was very important," confirmed Captain and Torschütter Steffen Hofmann, who, with green-white, came to number three.
Schrammel-Dreamtor brings Rapid on Siegerstraße Rapid has shown with the second season victory the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes into the country game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent leadership-volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute.
"I thought I was going in all the frustration of Thursday, and I snapped it under the latte," said the 26-year-old, smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time on November 13, 2010 in a Bundesligapartie, that was still for Ried.
The first race hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I am from the Rapid-Young," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvis-blesseur of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right side of the defense and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience to be able to exercise this position in a mirror.
He has earned the goal, he has already made some assists this year, "said Barisic.
The team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2: 0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
The guests could have written down before that.
"Thank God we have had some luck today," Schrammel also noted, referring to the gap between performance and results over the past few weeks: "The results have not been correct, but the playful was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games before you were better than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season."
The first three-point since 26 July has therefore proved that the team structure is, in spite of the setbacks, intact: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
For him, no less gratifying: "That we have finally played too zero again."
The fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar, and Michael Schimpelsberger, there are many failures to be made, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger, make the victory even more valuable.
"You can't forget that," Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The country-play break should therefore be used to "lick wounds and put a little bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One of the people who must be in a special position to take a break is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself up for the team, going over pain.
In this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids the structure before his change in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4: 2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "May not believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly also had a little bit of luck, but at some point the happiness must also come back to us.
Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.
He, of course, warned to concentrate on further work: "You must not always see it black and white.
We have not played as badly in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we can't believe it's all right now.

It's a very young team I can help very much right now.
They are in certain phases of my life, "said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team.
He regretted the fast counter-hit "from the category of Magic Gate," as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been unjustly revoked by referees of colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We have had too few degrees.
The interior defender Maximilian Karner looked like this: "It started badly, but then we found it and even made a goal.
In general, there would have been more in it.
Under this rust there is rest
We showed a powerful tribe in our riddle of the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweissenbrunn.
A bumpy walk leads up to the about 600-year-old oak.
It passes by the two-way, the basalt-stone-heap and the basalt-stone-sea.
A little bit below the quarry from the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stretches beyond the other trees of the area and is reminiscent of an American mast tree with a circumference of over eight meters.
A little Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer archive and has asked the elderly people from Unterweissenbrunn to know what kind of change it has with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
So until about 80 years ago, the goat-hikers were to have driven their animals from the underwhite well to the effortlessly grubbed meadows and liberated from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers, exhausted by the rise, have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, goat herds are actually grazing again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone collections, however, one should be careful, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for cross-otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweissenbrunn to the tree, which is a little hidden.
Further paths are signposted, the direction of Hochrhön rise and invite you to a long walk.
Where is the watercastle?
However, a watercastle, which is sought at our next task, is rather rare to find in height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building counter-fei could fit.
Where is our "piece of the Rhenish Happiness"?

After weeks of tugging, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the EU, Matteo Renzi, has, last week, won the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the head of the EU's foreign policy, and will be the successor of the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government-based daily La Repubblica reproduces, the appeal of his Mogherini, also a favorite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that the left party base, which is constantly rising up against him, will be quiet, because Mogherini is assigned to it - but rather in a moderate way.
In the view of the conservative representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome, was thus made a political balance.
The EU's chief diplomat will also become the deputy of President Juncker.
The still pending approval of the European Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important" recognition of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is a source of optimism that the Mogherini, which has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and which is known for its ambition, will face the "enormous challenges."
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
She began her political career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing democrats), which in 2008 merged with the Catholic centre party Margherita to become the current social-democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the left-wing party council, she entered the high party politics, working in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known through studies on NATO operations in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, and maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became a prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD now again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's over 40% vote in the EU elections in May, then, as is noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The talks in Brussels that the new EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner has too little diplomatic experience, which is not enough substance, are being held in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular, Poland and the Baltic members, the unbelievably realistic accents of Mogherini to the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and defamated as a "Russian-friendly course."
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe by bypassing Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
In July, after Renzi took up his term as EU President, Mogherini went to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with indignation, as well as inviting the Kremlin head for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an azubi who has already completed a different training in the company.
The new employees will be active in four training occupations: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg before the forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zähner from Pfreimd, as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited primary or middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years as well as the trainers go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day walk and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet transformation has met with disapproval from the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay with him," he said with great applause.
As a baffling gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong demands for a relaxation of the rules of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister for Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his co-socialists to show "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, spread sand into the transmission, in which she appeared at a meeting of a disobedient socialist member and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far right-hand leader of the National Front, mocked the constant ditch struggles of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls does not have any, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's reputation for the dissolution of the Parliament and said that she was confident that she would be the winner in early elections and that she was ready for the government.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival groups before the end of the term of office of Hollande in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise ahead of a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, is leading, according to experts of the industry, advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCLN) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, said the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo refused to comment.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is around $29 billion in total and is expected in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities for the IPO in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Gening Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino-mixing company under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.

In late June, according to the regulatory authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares, and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held 8 percent of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have together 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises IPO.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election.
A peking group swirled the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law which only allows two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the majority support of a nomination committee, which is likely to be filled with peking-faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and led pro-democracy activists to face their threat and to put an end to the Hong Kong financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership is afraid that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which set out China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in.
Li's survey is organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Commission on Legal Affairs of the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in front of the Hong Kong leaders' office in the afternoon.
The United Kingdom did not provide any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to take up "state talks" with East Ukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Sunday, Russian media reports demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and start negotiations on the "statehood" of the renegade region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of Eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists became part of Russia, but that its status with regard to Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents is in line with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: help for separatists in the oral of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija to be effective independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the area taken up as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are "trapped in their illusions" in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 October and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, said Itar-Tass.
"We need to start a wide-ranging discussion without delay, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been being discussed by the Kiev leadership for months in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's comments underlined Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in encountering the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and there was a large majority of pre-conflict surveys in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control of an area that connects the Russian territory with the Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that make important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on the introduction of office on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, which would give the respective areas greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement is accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed after a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea into eastern Ukraine.
The separatists supported by Russia took over the control of Novoasovsk in the hand, which, according to fears, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have been made to attach Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at an EU leadership meeting in Brussels and urged for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any concrete action, the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first, probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which were included by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian parachute hunters who were captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Naked photo channel around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make any sense about his anger about hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who is who of the A-celebrities from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal around celebrities.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "The Tributes of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also said to have published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
The noblest, who had engaged with Grecko last month, said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reported on a news page that the hack was "shameful" and that the people concerned felt "hurt."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures in which she is up without being in a pool.
The film works of Palmer include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence 'said to TMZ, "It's a hideous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
In legal terms, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, jogger and hikers were present yesterday at the 8th cycle on the Great Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for children with cancer."
The tour, which was a torture for one, was an easy training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus yesterday took a bike to the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the small muscle-cat, especially as the participation in the 8th cycle on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for children with cancer" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him a valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can - great!"
Little break on the way in the applet curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler City Parliament, many of the 718 participants were torturing themselves in the early morning and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to cross the 11 km long line between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The very red-faced Green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - made a little understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there is the destination!"), but then proved to be half a professional at the mountain and went through the target after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the line in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokesperson of the city of Oberursel, who had set off with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," said Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to get back to the height.
The Frankfurt-based Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9: 00 a.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then to roll home with fun.
It was fun, too, "Frits-Toni."
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, bike tours over the Feldberg are simply part of this.
He had been riding his 6.5-kilo racing wheel for 40 minutes.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there, "said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist."
He must be, too, because he was on the road with the "fixie wheel," which is also racing wheels, but without a circuit...
It was not only the 20 hikers who went up over the White Wall and the fox dance to the top that proved that it was easy to go up without a wheel, but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind him on a cord.
Mountain-guard doctor Professor Volker lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, provided security, said: "I know him" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sleigh rail, only that he draws the sleigh himself. "So the man is, in a sense, his own sleigh dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - were sent on the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10: 00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg" association, gave the starting points and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to lock the line up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
