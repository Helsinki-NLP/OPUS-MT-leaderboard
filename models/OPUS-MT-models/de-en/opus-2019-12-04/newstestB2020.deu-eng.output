Fire in French chemical plant deleted
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which was particularly dangerous, was extinguished. The Normandy Prefecture was informed on Friday. The fire had broken out at night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
The Fire could be stopped
It was called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine is producing additives for lubricants. The factory is part of Lubrizole of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU's so-called Seveso Directive, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when a leak in 2013 removed the gas methanthiol and the environment smelled far after lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's waste water system.
Woman announces her job to look for her missing bitch for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and she gave up her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short stay in Montana. 57 days was missing from the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," said Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could still be in the hotel somewhere, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says," She left about four, four and a half hours ago, "Carole King remembers" Daily Inter Lake. "When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days became weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake," who announced her job as a post office employee to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears were flowing"
57 days after Kate's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called in and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King got there, Katie had already disappeared again. She looked for the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered, "Daily Inter Lake." The tears were running. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them. "
Loss in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. The situation is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "scary" scale.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is the result of a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which the German editorial network reports on.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one gun and 3474 shot ammunition have so far returned. The still missing weapons and weapons are, among other things, six machine guns of the type MG3, 11 machine guns of the type G3, four G36 guns, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols. In addition, 30 machine guns of the type MG3 are missing.
The scope of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "frightening," said the left-wing MP Martina Renner. This was all the more true as there was little time to be found in the course of the investigation. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet." Renner criticised that the list was not clear whether the missing ammo was the one that was found in connection with the investigation of the terrorist-suspected federal military officer Franco A. "And this was, although a supporter of this ammo was recently condemned by the owner," he said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters. It was said from the shipping company that one wanted to wait for an official message from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was brought up on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Hormuz Sea Road under the charge of violating security rules. However, it was assumed that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary setting of an Iranian oil tanker before Gibraltar, a member of the United Kingdom.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil port is shipped through the sea. Voltages in the region have been increasing in recent months, and commercial shipping has been brought into conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel commends people's courage in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has praised the commitment of the people in the GDR, who went on the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens would have put the GDR regime at risk, said Merkel at a ceremony of the Thuringia CDU Group on the coming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor, among other things, reminded us of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "State security was taken away from terror," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Tesla's quarter may have a record. Despite the delivery boom, there were last losses in the electric car company.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek."
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of the market with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, in the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers have to be found. In particular, the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
solved puzzle: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebral brain prevents people from being able to tickle themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out this with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday night. Progress has also been made on the question of why children are so strongly fighting against tickling, just to ask for more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the coming closer to a tickling hand only causes laughter before the touch, which is due to a deep layer in the cerebral mind, which already causes laughter in the expectation of the tickling.
According to the data, previous research has shown that rats with "laughter" in the ultrasound area react when they are tickled by humans. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments in the rats that the laughter and the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touch. This is also the case when living beings brush themselves. During the foreign touch and the tickling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse have been amplified.
If, however, the self-contact and the contact by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat's brain cannot distinguish between the self-contact and the contact by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves, so they sometimes broke off this initiation in the experiment, showed escape behaviour or starvation. This ambivalence was similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the tickle was a behavior reaction that was the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: large fire in French chemical plant deleted
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This is what the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP reported on Friday. The fire had broken out at night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no dangerous substances should have been released. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens have been closed
Residents were called not to leave their houses. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. Lubrizole is part of the company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU's so-called Seveso Directive, which requires particularly strict safety requirements. Around 400 people work in the plant.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on the speech by Boris Johnson at the first meeting in Parliament after the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatened to lead the country without agreements from the EU on 31 October, if Brussels did not respond to his requests for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but how he wanted to achieve that is unclear.
The Prime Minister said about Cox, who had been working for the UK to remain in the European Union, "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to reunite this country would be to take the EU's exit." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
The memorial to the attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honour of the victims is revealed on Saturday in Norway. The monument "Jernrosenen" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They remind of the roses that had left by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the Cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlrud is now to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. The opening is expected, among others, of KronPrince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first set fire to a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN general debate did not solve the conflict in Iran. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which was held in Iran, was able to go back to sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of the Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in Hormus Street in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now going to Dubai for medical investigations, explained shipping chief Erik Hånell. At noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's good that it's over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the sea. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard had set the tanker on July 19 under the charge of disrespecting the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well, said Hånell. They would have acted professionally in the past ten weeks in the face of the difficult and exciting situation. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar after the establishment of the "Stena Impero," where a supertanker of oil from Iran was put on the chain at the beginning of July, which was intended for Syria. According to the authorities, the supply was in breach of EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Conjections that it was a trade-off to get the "Stena Impero" released, London was vehemently rejected.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil port is shipped through the sea. The tensions in the region have been increasing in recent months, and commercial shipping has been brought into conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
The nuclear dispute between Tehran and Washington is behind the tension between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leaders of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US had left the international nuclear agreement alone, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time to end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a more stringent and extended agreement to other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the road of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protective powers, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war winner". In a UBS survey, India is one of the preferred alternatives, which, of course, has not only to deal with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war, but also to relocate foreign producers in the People's Republic. Financial leaders of Asian companies, who are considering moving their production from China to another country, call it one of the UBS's preferred alternatives. This has, of course, not only to do so with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to play a more important role in the global production chain.
But now India itself has come into the focus of Trump's. Derived by the Hautegen in the White House as the "Kingdom of Customs," America has taken away the trade advantages for 2000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The US is prohibitively accusing India of high tariffs and calling for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the riots with India are, of course, just a side-scene. In addition, America is looking at the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine concern about China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American criminal duties against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who has just made a second five-year term of office, is therefore likely to be in safety.
The problem is, however, in another place: the emphatically hardened theory that open markets are accelerating economic development has a serious status in the socialist Republic of India. Even under Modi. His reformer is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic error that suffocated all the business spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive fast building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective bankruptcy and bankruptcy law creates conditions for the likely to liquidate dead companies with high debt more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In the first five years of the Modi period, many things have turned out to be better in India. However, this does not apply in trade policy. The National Conservative Government has even created new barriers to the protection of highly competitive companies from foreign suppliers in the world.
In the West, Modi is attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who has radically renewed his country economically, and this impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows too well what vocabulary Western managers like. However, in essence, the "India First" lawyer has never come out of a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Business people who, thanks to the shutting off of their industries, are, members of the national political groups of the European Union.
The funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, the former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state would be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP, calling on the Chirac family. The funeral would take place in the close family. For Sunday a public funeral in the Paris Invalidendom was scheduled, as media reported.
Taken to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championship
The world's top was already in the finish for a long time when the cold-cooled Khalifa International Stadium was in a warm-up position. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swam dangerously. He could hardly keep his feet on the finish. The forces were in an unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly subdued him and supported the last half-stage round of the finish. However, the two forces were not enough to stop the running watch.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. He was shy, he didn't want to talk about his heroism at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best time and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a man who was suffering. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup. In normal circumstances, he should not have even started for my country. "
He did this on the evening with a lot of emphasis - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this heroism will be remembered. In the end, the Busby, which came to the finish with a lot of help, even left its competitor Busby in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, about five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had nothing to do, because the Busby was disqualified by the World Light Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, was set up to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved at 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes before." However, only in training, the best times do not count.
Millions of Mash: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the run-up to possible anti-government protests. There was an increased police presence in the centre of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were closed.
In recent days, the police had increased their road controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been hundreds of protests in Egypt. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction and actor Mohammed Ali, who put the demonstrations on Facebook, called for a "million march" in central places for the country today. "Ali called for a young man to come to the people's army, because he was not a good man," because he called for the young army. "
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. However, these numbers were not confirmed at first. The government also confirmed and did not comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "arbitrarily arrested," "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'," HRW, on appeal to lawyers, informed Festenmäger. According to their lawyers, the accusations against the arrested range from "spread of false information" to "membership in a" terrorist association. "In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, the security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, and according to HRW, also arbitrarily passers-by.
HRW also criticised censorship in the North African country. As a result, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealer: Shipping Dealers should be able to donate more easily
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost goods. About 20 million retourers land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate back-sent products instead of destroying them.
While it is not possible to exempt the companies from the sales tax on donations, the Ministry explained a question of the Green House group, about which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday. However, the dealers could set the market value of the unselling retourers so low that they would have to pay no or little turnover tax.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that the federal citizens would return one in six packages on orders on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the waste. They would give the companies, according to current legal situation, cost additional money, because the tax authorities value real-estate donations like a turnover that then comes up with sales tax.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot assess products that are not available for sale and can donate to non-profit organisations free of charge, and that companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations, not only for online trade but also for other business, from the fashion shop to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament," is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksys's work "underlines the reformation of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes." From Saturday the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on October 3. It is estimated to be between EUR 1.5 and two million.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion the work, which was formerly called "Question Time," was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegate Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at the first meeting of the House of Commons, after a forced break by the Supreme Court of Johnson, had made a hard exchange of views with the opposition. Johnson, if necessary, wants to do the Brexit, which has already been postponed twice on 31 October, without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England he painted a picture that is a man who, with a chisel, breaks a star of the European flag. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The strong verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. In comparison to the campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy this. We will (from the EU) quit and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit's opponents in the Parliament in the past few days and accused them of, among other things, "betrayal" of the people. Allegations that he could put the Members at risk because they could become the target of murder threats, he did not act as a "humbug."
Cummings said that the only way to get back to peace is if the British Members finally respect the decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people are concerned that the UK has still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the atmosphere, even the Bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the Uno General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between Pakistan and India is likely, said Khan on Friday at the Uno General Debate in New York. "If this is going bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. In early August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region from its autonomy and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the fall of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is responding with a hard hand to the current protests in Egypt. It is shooting at the population with a sharp ammo, and more than 2000 prisoners are in prison for the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in it. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt, but since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario like in the times of Arab spring.
But one of the reasons for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being choked by the own government drove millions into the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he is financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, the dilemma will always be able to afford to have a large part of the water in the supermarket.
Tüv-Trials in Terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstop" for capital airport
Two months have been checked whether the complex system is working together with the BER fire protection system. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the tuv is not yet ready on the BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, which is certain, said the Supervisory Board head Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control board.
Airport chief Engelbert Litke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still shortcomings to be done in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real show stop." He assured that the schedule for commissioning still contains buffers.
There are, however, indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large, and the site display is now to be submitted to the building office during the first quarter of 2020, and this was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of flaws of power cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of the operation, it is necessary to continue to work intensively on the processing of the flaws," said a written communication.
Lietke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable lines are hanging. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection is not yet working satisfactorily at the transition to the station under the terminal. The problems had led the project to a further crisis three years ago. This time, it is about smoke spills that are going down in a fire like a screen so that the smoke does not spread. They are going too far down. 36 engines have to be replaced. Then, at the beginning of the year, there will be new tests with hot gas smoke.
Problems with fire protection and other building defects as well as planning errors delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally it should go into operation in 2011. The costs have increased from two billion in 2006 to approximately 6.5 billion in 2006.
As the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the responsible parties are planning to expand the airport. Therefore, the special meeting of the Supervisory Board is scheduled to take place on 18 October, as announced by the Chairman Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial director Heike Fölster changes to the Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, head of staff Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She had put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Drugs vending machines - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and he blew up a lot of machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased considerably. A million damage has been caused!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police took a 33-year-old German on Bu rgerstraße and on the Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the use of explosive explosions in the unit with a particularly serious case of theft caused by the Chemnitz criminal police, this suspicion was not only against the 33-year-old."
Faced with the new evidence, 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight actions.
The police spokesperson: "It seems that he has financed his drug addiction with the spoils." The bomber alone had blown up car parking machines on the Bu rgerstraße between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The machine bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation against him is continuing.
It can be thought that he was also responsible for further machine explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reversing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the competition with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA "takes over the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," confirmed on Friday an Austrian Airlines spokesman to APA. "AviationNetOnline" had previously reported about this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost aircraft Eurowings is thus de facto disbanded. Four of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft remain in Vienna. The AUA will take over from January 2020 in the "Wetlease," including Eurowings staff. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will be used as charter machines from Salzburg and Innsbruck. The routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, the speaker said. The flight times will be adjusted to include connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other, to expand the decentralised transport from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for the group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants are from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights started under AUA flight number will be operated in the report no longer in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price struggle has broken out at Vienna Airport after the Niki-Blint. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamation only announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna will be increased to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost aircraft will send four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease," which the union criticised as a bypass to the collective agreement.
The battle announcement by Ryanair's head Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, said on Friday, AUA board member Andreas Otto: "We will remain number one at the site in five, six or ten years."
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four are married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news of the British Royals: In the early month of Italy's holidays, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped for the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are very pleased to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can't wait to be actually married," said the couple, who has been together since October 2018, in the official communication.
And further, "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the years to come, full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie clipped the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and have also been published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is due to take place in 2020. More information on date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
It is certain, however, that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a party similar to the marriage of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find out more in detail the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is promoting the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high-rise hospital Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are one of the main factors influencing cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not well known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University of the Heart and Vascular Centre at the UKE.
At present, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known as possible disease-causing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations -, it was said by the hospital. Every year about 200 were added.
The aim of the five-year project is, according to the initiators, to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be used in the research of other people's diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of the Heart and Vascular Centre. New insights on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer diseases are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm will to use the data for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be established at the medical campus there and a professor for Bioinformatics created. In order to justify his commitment, the Swiss logistics company said that he had been operating in the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The biologists of the healthy participants come from Hamburg, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study." With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the hospital. In the case of the genetic encryption, the scientists assured them that it was a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the human genome can be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure cost of the material would be 1300 Euro. The first gene sequencing world-wide, the results of which were published in 2001, had cost several hundred million Euro. The study is expected to start on 1 October, and all 9000 samples should be analysed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police free hundreds of mistreated boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to evidence from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the still minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them said that they had been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and "improved." In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers under "most degrading and inhumane conditions," said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children of the age of nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had been in existence for about ten years. Local authorities had drawn attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often poor state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Fund, over 40,000 people have therefore fled across the border to the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
In a school in northern Nigeria, police officers have freed almost 400 students from horrific conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school, and the conditions there were "unworthy of men" and the officials arrested the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all the boys, had been held like slaves at their school and had been put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. TV pictures showed attenuated and injured students in a clearly poor state of health.
World Cup: Further allegations of Messiah and Klops Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association of Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth award and thus the record.
After Nicaragua's captain said he never voted in the World Football League election, other countries are accused of the Fifa. Egypt was not judged at all - with a curious reason.
A lot of the Fifa has proved to be insidious in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Foot Players' election has not yet been suspected of being unclean - if one does not see that the voting national trainers and national team captains of the member associations are often more likely to vote according to sympathy than to objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt is complaining that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible vote.
The Fifa apologizes in so far as "the signatures on the electoral forms were given in capital letters and therefore not valid." The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's coach is also surprised
There is also a cry from Sudan about the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally judged: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, the vote had been taken as well, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Federation.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "I did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All the information on my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The report came from the Association on Friday: True, but of course it was not intended. The completed election documents were "erroneous" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said it was in a communication from the Association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," it was said in the communication. However, both Rosas and team trainer Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "as it was in the official list of the FIFA."
The other cases are now being examined by the Fifa in an investigation, but it stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Football Winner - and Jürgen Klop World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine affair: senior Republicans are in favour of official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have been openly in favour of an official investigation against the US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the US state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, the facts are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the withdrawal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a telephone call to examine the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden has been watching "for years."
The Republicans have so far held back on criticism of Trump for the Whistleblower affair, but few have been uneasy about it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned to Trump's policy on several occasions, such as the easing of environmental protection rules and the tightening of immigration rules.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, was also in favour of the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of US states, have formally no participation in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolic. However, the first Republican senators have also expressed their critical views on the situation. In the middle of Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, for example, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that the first cracks in the area are occurring.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an office-suspension procedure against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation to this effect, and they accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the withdrawal procedure, and with their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called improvement, but the decision on the actual withdrawal would be in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority, so the prospects for success of such a procedure are low, and so far no US President has been removed from the Office by an appeal procedure.
Were there any torturers on the board of Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they are said to have raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unlawfully controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 lybian refugees on board. After strong protests and international criticism - also by Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against Rackete are being made. Thus, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea Watch 3." The suspects were caught in a reception camp in Messina, Sicily, after migrants had recognized their peers in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any secure information," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Newbauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country were raped, tortured and even killed. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," it was said in the communication at that time.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed up."
Italy's right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately requested an apology from Rackete, who is still being identified in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek."
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of the market with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95.000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, in the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers have to be found. In particular, the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US budget dispute: once again only one bridge financing
The new financial year will start in the US on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is before the new fiscal year, which began on 1 October, once again without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (continuing resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have taken place on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has yet to enter into force.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the Federal Government is now being financed at the level and in line with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the end of the financial year 2019 on Monday, because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities, and the Federal Government cannot therefore benefit from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion dollars.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which are hardly capable of majority voting.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump. Democrats are disregarding the building plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the building of the wall was escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The spirits divorce in the building of the wall
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all 12 expenditure laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November is more likely than a shutdown.
In the context of the continued inability of the Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, and the resulting risk of shutdown, ideas to automate the process of popularity gain. In 1877, in order to avoid shutdown, the financing of the federal administration would be automatically continued at the level of the previous year, to prevent the travel of the parliamentarians and to hold back their wages until the new annual expenditure plans were available.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is also to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that all women can claim in-vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous semen donations.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-hand camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Episcopal Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core part of a bioethics law, which the Minister of Health, Agnès Buzyn, defended as a "chance" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the cost of artificial infertility for all women is to be borne by social security.
Insemination with semen of dead husband further prohibited
By a small majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which was intended to give widows access to the sperm of their dead man for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem." In Germany, there were cases in which women in vain complained about the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the incident argued that such a child was "particularly serious in the past."
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had opposed the artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be "double mourning" if her husband's death would not have fulfilled her child's desire.
The initiators of the amendment, which has now failed, consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized in future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the surrogate mother was still prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: calls for flights for unis become louder
A lot is being flown at the universities, and that is why the country wants to have a climate levy in the future, and the rectors say they have no money for it, but now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also be limited in flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate change levy on flights from universities and universities, which had been postponed before the summer break, is on the rise again. After the National Rectors' Conference had skeptically responded to an appropriate advance from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a educational university for a compensation of service flights, which was the first step "urgently needed," at the same time, there had to be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, it is said in their opinion. The originally planned government decision on the Green House is still being adopted because the first of July.
Russia once again captures North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the prisoners have been illegally fishing in Russian waters. Ten days before, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a change of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later died of his serious injuries. However, this time there were no injuries, it was said.
The Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages, so the North Korean fishermen were in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard, according to its own information, is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 octopus seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 squid fish were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, according to three fishing boats and two motor boats, the information was confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to thousands of North Korea fishermen, the media have been arrested there for some time this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow-scale synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small living beings out of the sea. In addition, the nets would be simply disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be crushed.
In the future, only 18,000: the US will reduce the ceiling on asylum
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shutting itself down against protection-seekers: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal access of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, the most threatened believers and Iraqis will be given asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be let into the country, as the US State Ministry said. In the almost past marketing year, the limit is still around 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's government has drastically reduced the receptive capacity for protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, much higher reception limits had been established.
The attached ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the US the "most merciless and generous nation in history," a phrase that strongly reminds of the language used by the President-in-Office of the Council.
A "responsible handling" of refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries in order to help with the reconstruction, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to seal off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a possible threat of disablement.
The US government, according to the Foreign Office, wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been in danger, as the Foreign Ministry's statement shows.
The US wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America are applying for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US South border with Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An orangutan female, at the request of the Argentinian justice, has been moved from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a reception station for human monkeys in the USA. The "Sandra" born in 1986 at the Rostoker Zoo was assigned the rights of a "non-human person," therefore their release is mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday night by direct flight - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez said.
As the 53-kilogram human monkey is not able to adapt to the life in the wilderness, she is to live in the open-air area of the Center for Great Aces in Florida. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles," former pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before moving in Florida, "Sandra" has to pass a 40-day quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandra" fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal protectors in 2014, has helped to transform the Zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education centre is to be established there to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husar ride on the almost 3000-metre-high Great Zinn in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other aid, the Swiss had to force the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Zine in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute flaw-free Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. He thus undercut the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit increase. Net profit in the past quarter increased to $1.4 billion (just under €1.3 billion), which is 25 percent more than in the previous year's period, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The reason for this is mainly the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct," with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales increased to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. The most strong increases in Nike sales were made in China with an increase of 22 percent. Thus, the group from Beaverton in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic from its approach to direct itself to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial chief Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Long-term ban on stadion because of racism in Italy
For racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a life-long ban on a fan. The defender Jesus, who comes from Brazil, had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@ officialasroma you already know what to do with such a fan. # NoTocism. Pride to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the account of the fan to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma party should never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. It is a regular scandal of Italian fans of racist harassment against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. It is necessary to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist songs in the first-league game between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
But also for the followers of Juventus Turin, there had been last discussions. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 leading fans of record-winning Juventus Turin. Four of them are not expected to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. The other are therefore subject to bans of four to seven years.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with an ad last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade in tickets. They would have "military-controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and blackmailed Juventus employees to get more favourable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - whole generations are taken into account with gripping names. Look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective feelings of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call, on September 21, the crab fishing started on the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also opened the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which is the southern outlet of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has in ecological terms ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields." The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already started to breed crab in the early 1990s. Over the course of time, the crab industry has become a major sector that has provided high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively involved in large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming and technology-based crab farming, and the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the incomes of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform for the "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and has developed with care the service network for "permits under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network of services, a platform for lending," which aims to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun is fully exploiting the local benefits of connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui, and is using the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a sign of the public. At the same time, Gaochun has been fully involved in the development of an intelligent high-end production company, biomedical and medical industry, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health industry, as well as organic farming companies, which are leading in the "3 + 2" area of tourism.

Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. The United States, in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, had envisaged an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump disagreed with the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation in this way: the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had urged for a meeting to take place. "And America says that I will lift the sanctions," Ruhani added. The nature of the sanctions that should be put to an end had been at debate. "And they clearly said that we would lift all the sanctions."
However, Ruhani was not able to do this in an acceptable way. In view of the existing criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure," no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the margins of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - almost 200 aftershocks
After a short period of time, Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, so hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday the earthquake of the strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Every year, badly built houses collapse - among other things, grumbled by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered as a refuge in the centre have long been built. It was only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August that the civil engineering chamber of Istanbul had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earth-proof.
The epicentre of the quake of Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres depth, as the Civil Protection Authority informed Afad. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, said on Twitter that the injured or the damage had not been reported at first. The state sender TRT showed people who ran into panic from the houses. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some of the students wept as was seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Plate. Turkey is constantly being shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of the strength of 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. In the earthquake of Thursday it already hit the West of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with all the needs standing next to house doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is shaking. When the next big quake comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, after his return from New York, that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul disaster coordination centre (Akom). According to his information, two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer collapsed.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been more violent than that of Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned about quakes via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the time of the quake is given at 13.59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a quake, which was given with a thickness of 4.0 on the judge scale.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of strength 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Its epicentre had also been located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the Civil Protection Authority informed Afad on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that, sooner or later, a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will be unloaded at some point - and will cause massive damage.
Strawberry-researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It was more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," said Ersoy to the station. "Sooner or later the big earthquake will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania, there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. This year, too, the earth had been shaking at Lake Constance.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide for new fuel in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible withdrawal process, the US Democrats are strengthened: the complaint about Trump and its controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president, submitted by an anonymous whistleblower, and the fact that Trump himself is once more a victim of a "witch hunt," he also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines' passenger locked in the toilet - redirected aircraft
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline informed the US media.
At an out-of-plan stop on Wednesday night (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be freed from the tight cabin. She had been locked in it for about an hour, US media wrote by calling on other passengers. For further flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video published on the Internet, which is supposed to be from Flight 1554 according to US media, we can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are working on opening the door, ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?," says a man in it. The airline had apologized to all passengers. The first thing that was open was whether the woman was getting a compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit mess? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation" the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "The Kakerlake" ("The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sam," who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now at once the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in fact and is wildly determined to be stopped by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When the Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteers in high positions almost supplicate the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write." By McEwan was only published in the spring of the novel "Machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first story, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into a huge bug," is gradually being excluded from the family and society and is finally being destroyed. "Ian McEwan is inclined to Kafka to describe a world that stands its head," it was said by the Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's rail infrastructure
11.200 cars in Austria and Hungary get whisper brakes to reduce the noise from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway links between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to the EU Authority, this is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU's Connecting Europe Facility.
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all travel until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travel could "not be made for insolvency reasons," the company announced on Thursday night.
It also affected bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Travel and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As it is about travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the trap of the British parent company and had filed an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, which includes, among other things, Neckermann travel, Öger Tours and Bucher travel, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which are still hosting Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance company. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers will no longer be invited to extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts will now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travellers from these hotels are not immediately requested or otherwise required to pay individual hotel bills," said Speaker Bernd Engelien.
The insurance thus responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their own accommodation on the ground. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
How many hotels are affected will be voted on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance spokesperson. According to information from Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook package holidays from Germany were still on the way. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution to the future.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by the Zurich insurance company only help the travelers who are still on the move. For Thomas Cook customers who want to go on holiday, it looks bad. On the late Thursday night the company announced that all travel until October 31 would be cancelled. This was also true for those bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands about travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance the further procedure was examined, it said. In principle, the insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could find out about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price on the Kaera website and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys warmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa, he is now walking directly in the footsteps of his mother.
In Angola, the British Prince Harry has set fire to an explosive mine and destroyed it with a blue splinter-protection vest.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Conduco, he made the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance the explosive body exploded in the Savannah landscape, without any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his Africa trip, Harry then wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same warmaster who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go the way she went. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a warmed minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Staging Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not have a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made with the Polarizing British for a long time already. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the UK hovering like a Damocles sword over the blonhead. His suspension of the Parliament to carry out his Brexit course until the date of departure was cancelled at the beginning of this week, and a law adopted by the Parliament, however, had been obliged to make a split extension of the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass Johnson in any way. In the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he suggested that he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna follow the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm carefully optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out of time for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. For about six weeks now, the EU and the British negotiators have the time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements, but the recent talks have not yet reached a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October is now more difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not pass the law, the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister.
US Authority: Further deaths due to e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the US has increased to 12. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the US Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 patients, some 500 of whom have been confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known, and the complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
A million times, the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The construction company and actor living in Spain is calling for a "people's revolution." For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, who are accused of corruption and mismanagement. Ali is hoping for mass donations with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities have been alerted. There has already been an increased police presence in the centre of Cairo. Several subway stations have remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square have been closed. In recent days, the police have increased their road controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces responded hard. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW informed the people of Festenmühlener, calling on lawyers.
The organization also criticised censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013, after he overthrew the democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. On his arrival in the Hamburg port, he was welcomed, among other things, by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race yacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
In recent months, with a team of scientists, Fuchs has examined and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. For decades it was known that the earth was warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What is happening on the sea often takes place under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. The expedition had, among other things, been measured with a drone of Greenland glacial ice and caught with networks of microplastic, it was said.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas." For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example, "said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony." He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades. "
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 Euro for noodles
430 Euro for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from the Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed to be two Japanese tourists too much. The bill with 80 Euro tip was paid by the two women, but it posted the receipt on Facebook, which caused heated reactions.
"Such cases are damaging to the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to examine whether this is a fraud," said a spokesperson from Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant was prompt. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Even a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be faced with a disablement procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposed to be the telephone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who has brought the conversation to the public for concern about national security and the democracy of the United States with his complaint, is monstrous: the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election of 2020. He has extorted the dependence of Ukraine in this process and so wants to force it to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be seen in the now published copy of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not reflect the full text. The phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story in which the center of Trump is mainly his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story is starting from the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans report to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Selensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in an election, we are interfering in an investigation into what we have the right to do," he says the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but "nothing is illegal." Giuliani wants that in Ukraine, because this is a very helpful basis for my government - and that is very helpful for my clients. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had been in contact with actors in Ukraine, said critics at the time, to build an occasion for Russia's investigation in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is exactly the investigation that Trump will be talking about on the phone with Selensky in July. The version of Giuliani and the President is: the former Vice-President and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, had, as a Ukraine representative of the Obama government, pushed for the release of then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Schokin, to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for, on whose board his son, Hunter Biden, was working. Bisenor, in order to blackmail the Ukraine, the corrupt magistrates.
In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Attorney General to go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. In addition, Schokin was accused of being deeply corrupt, the US government was far from the only Western partner who was pressing for his release. Moreover, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Interruptions with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive problems with Instagram and Facebook. Thus, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allomerungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading time and again since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the incident, although not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disorders
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July the services had been out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also use Twitter this time mainly to make their trouble air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were on their way with a tubular boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter to rescue them.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9: 30 we received the message, just before 10 we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the tubular."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, and 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi-Standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have finally come on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from early July. The wireless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn of the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees even if the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the weight of the charge pad increases, which in turn the power consumption.
Capacity and life
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. Each and every degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery is not only a loss of capacity, but it is not as long as it can last. The service life is therefore lower. The researchers therefore recommend to charge the smartphone always by cable. Since an battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of an battery exchange even once more - for all the phones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable: simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without any annoying cable salad and tireless plug-in-line. As the Qi (for inductive energy transmission) is a global standard, with Apple as an exception, there are no restrictions. However, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau-Photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese climber, according to his own data, has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator announced.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Postable." He has made international headlines: He has taken a photo of mountain climbers who are on Mount Everest in the spring.
The image of the mass attack triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-metre high mountain and highest peak of the earth. In May, eleven climbers died in a few days at the ascent.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousand: Currently Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is, among other things, bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to allow it to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephant was poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited earlier rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously held themselves unharmed. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This is usually done when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants are still living. The death penalty is, in theory, the death penalty.
British oil tanker is being held out of Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after his arrest by Iran. This was announced by the shipping agency Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard had set the tanker flying under the British flag on 19 July under the charge of disrespecting the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Criticism
The responsible Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to examine the collapse of the travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive way, and it is about the board's salary packages as well as the question of why the British government was unable to make a financial contribution to the company fighting for survival. "Our interest is in the supervision of the company as well as in the control of external accountants," said the committee president Rachel Reeves in London. "Apparently, we are dealing with a bad example of management."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of colon cancer
The role of the genes in the family's increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore likely to be more severe than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colon cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek." The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110 '000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of the market with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95 '000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars. In order to do this, six-digit numbers have to be found in the current and next quarter. In particular, the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Does British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson withhold
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is covering himself to the question of whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the law against an unregulated Brexit, which was last decided by the Parliament, and on a question to which he only said to journalists on Friday that his government would respect the right to do so.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement had been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister, John Major, had expressed the presumption that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a process that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's departure.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran appears to be going up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of willingness to take concrete action," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the edge of the UN General Assembly in New York. In case they were not to their promises, he "further steps" were to be taken away from the agreements of the hard-negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return included the commitment to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US, on its own, went out of the agreement to force Iran, with "maximum pressure," to change its course in the Middle East policy considered to be aggressive. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions, and now again, the US has put a hard penalty on Tehran. Iran has recently responded to this with a rebound of the limited uranium enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now also uses uranium to use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September or has at least prepared for use. According to the IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps Europeans were not prepared to bear their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of US sanctions, Rohani said, but there would still be further talks, which I hope would be a solution.
Rohani continues to denounce Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the situation changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US's assessment on Monday that Tehran is responsible for the attack. Originally, the Hathi rebels in Yemen supported by Iran had committed themselves to the attack, but this was considered by the US to be a false commitment. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," said Rohani. However, the European leaders could not have done so in the discussions with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would have called only for the rebels in Yemen to be unable to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the past few days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration's far-reaching sanctions had to be lifted, Rohani asked. He asked the Washington government to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet of other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the deep of the universe. This was first achieved. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn on other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his explorer on 2I / Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The far-reaching comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory on the Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
After 1I / 'Oumumamua of 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was seen during a transit of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insights into a foreign solar system from close to it before it resolves on no time. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," for example Davide Farnochia of the US space agency Nasa reported in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet is on the way on a so-called hyperbial track that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honor of its discovery, the interstellar tail star, which was first led under the catalogue number C / 2019 Q4, was named 2I / Borisov, the first part of the name, which points out that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I / 'Oumumamua, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in the approach. Thus, the researchers will remain for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen by medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be seen with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team around Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I / 'Oumumamua, in a first examination determined the diameter of the sky object on 2 to 16 kilometers. The Gemini Observatory in Hawaii shows a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers of the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and this points out that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets could be formed in other solar systems by similar processes to those of our, as in our, de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years, according to the IAU, suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such stoppages are, is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency wants to place the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet interceptor) on a waiting position of 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth. According to Esa-Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is intended to lurk either on an unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1I / 'Ouumamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
On time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic of China, it is ready: at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled annually at the new airport, and in 2025 it will be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's recent prestigious project is also called "sea stars" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runway and runway, which will later be extended to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway will transport passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly told us that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the main city airport in Germany, which was under construction since 2006, and much smaller, has so far been postponed. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine landed already after four years.
New over-sonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is what the British Space Agency dreams of. The US channel CNN quoted the agency, which was launched for the 2030s, is a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breeding Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire. "This is the technology that could definitely do this," said Agenturf Graham Turnock of the station. "We are talking about the 20 years of commissioning and the 20 years of start-up."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work with the Australian more closely. In 2000, a flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis takes about 20 hours. The Concorde had been the only over-sonic aircraft to be used for passenger transport from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003, and it took three to three and a half hours to do so. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at Paris airport, Charles de Gaulle, in which all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, the American aircraft builder Lockheed Martin, who was also developing such plans in the U.S. Space Agency, the "
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable rams."
Washington uprisings: Trump wants to track down anonymous typos in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair of possible US President abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to find possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday in front of staff of the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past one was "a little different" than today.
This was regarded as a intimidation attempt against typists. The event was actually not public. However, several US media broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats were outraged at the President's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday that they had been prepared for an office withdrawal procedure against Trump. Their allegations were based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer, who raised serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. On the basis of great public pressure, the statements of the indictor had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants information from several government staff, according to which the US President "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country is involved in the US election 2020 for his benefit.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate, which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his sprout from the Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the run for the democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of the cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone: leading government staff would have tried to keep the exact text of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been prepared, but this had been removed from a database that was usually provided for in the White House after the interview with lawyers, and had instead been stored in a particularly protected system.
The identity of the indictor is not publicly known, and the "New York Times" reported that he was a member of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
On Friday, Trump again called into question the credibility of the source. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called "whistleblower" has spread information from the second hand, which would have turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may be no typfers or spies at all.
However, as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have given information to the Whistleblower, it caused indignation. The president of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, responded with concern and complained that Trump's statement once again undercut the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations have been taking place in various committees for months against Trump and its environment. In the face of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new force to set in motion a possible withdrawal procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a timetable for our investigation," said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of a false representation of things and once again called for the resignation of the committee president. Trump regularly insults ship and had asked for its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government officials in the security and foreign policy field, who were mostly active under democratic but also under Republican presidents, were behind a statement published on Friday in support of the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible withdrawal from office. If the allegations were to be accepted, it would be "a ruthless abuse of power by Trump."
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision on actual disqualification was taken in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority, and the prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW works council: jobs are "slipping" down
The VW brand's plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe, which is a concern of the car manufacturer's works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual production costs of 10 billion euros by two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros will be saved this year.
The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be reduced by the car manufacturer if it is practically demonstrated that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, a job security is applicable until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which were not actually to be disposition, are "creeping" over another way - that is, past the official course. Thus, free-standing regular jobs would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the works council had no possibility of force the reoccupation. In the meantime, there was a lack of staff in many parts of the world to increase the number of work compaction, and the concern about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle works would be greater. This also increased the fear that vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the volume of employment is done as agreed in a socially acceptable way along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to standardise the production world-wide even more and to control new projects centrally. It is also intended to reduce costs and also to speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. At a management conference in Berlin, production director Andreas Tostmann said: "We are well advised, especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the imminent trade war between the US and China, to make ourselves crisis-proof."
On this way there are already successes: for example, this year for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. In front of journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, is to be reduced by 1.1 hours. The exact figures for the production time are not called VW, according to the information of our newspaper it is about the Golf 7.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-internal is subject to the rule of thumb, that there must be 800 000 cars per year, so that the plant is sufficiently profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity utilisation in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling diesel demand and the problems in the transition to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedure WLTP.
As production director Tostmann has already announced last year, however, one million cars from the band are to roll "perspective" in Wolfsburg. This is to make it possible to pool the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is being converted to the location for the e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently decreased. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. It is to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburg for the time being, despite all efforts to build the e-mobility.
Forced to prostitution with Voodoo: Human traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been given vows, forced into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had taken young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the out-of-return Nigerian women had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought over the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in hose boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. When they arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to work off the alleged sluice costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, the pay was completely reduced to them.
The defendants - four men and two women - admitted the introduction and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the announcement of the judgment. "Some were really challenged."
The judgments are based on commercial and gang-based smuggling of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimps and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight crew union Ufo has again threatened with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on 14 October about the labour-fighting measures in the LH Group," Ufo's board of directors Daniel Flohr informed on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have for months refused to conduct collective bargaining with the Ufo. The question is also whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo is now being strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to have it found that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal against it. "I think that a second court considers the matter completely different," said Ufo's board of directors Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted a request to the Landesarbeitungsgericht Frankfurt to have the status of Ufo as a trade union examined in court. The company argued that the trade union had not set up a representative board for months and was thus unable to complete its role as a collective partner.
The result was a strong management dispute in the division trade union, in which many members of the board of directors and the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had, because of the doubts about its leadership, exposed an already started sense of grudge about the strikes of cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but it is now to change, and the country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa rules.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the tourism commission announced the intention to increase the number of international and local visitors to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the President of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with members of the desert state. With the new rules, the Erzconservative Kingdom is hoping for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the oil field in Churais. As a result, national oil production broke down dramatically, oil prices were rising. It should take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram stories on Thursday (local time), on which she can be seen in the white wedding spot. Reality-star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor's party in Los Angeles according to the People's magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry in church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the "yes" word a year ago in a New York state office. There was no big party at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you do not want to make compromises, you cannot have a relationship."
Two dead in the case of an aircraft crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metshin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday night, after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use in the search. The accident case still has to be determined. The crash site is about 30 km south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 km northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-resident species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of the cities are also the causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 species of trees known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent, of which 58% are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of the threat and thus before the extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered," "severely endangered," "threatened by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct." In total, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as at risk.
Boese and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was the most threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat, in addition to a fungus, is the Balkan miner moth. It has been spreading from South-East Europe throughout the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. In this assessment, the trees in cities, parks and alleys are not taken into account.
Shrubs and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of the molluscs and mosses and almost half of all species of shrubs are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, the introduction of species, agricultural practices and climate change. Slichen like snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overseen and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We must limit the impact of man on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the data, there were no dead. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have therefore been damaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the million metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes in the past 20 years, said Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North-Anatolian disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth's plate.
One of the most serious quakes was one of the strength 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicentre was then in Gölcük south-east of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people died.
On Tuesday, a earthquake of strength 4.6 had already shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced that on Twitter. "It's not gonna be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of himself and Lopez. She is extremely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be ready in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the mid-term show. "Now it is even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will be performing with another latina." She can't wait to "show what we girls can do on the world's biggest stage."
In a statement, Shakira pointed out that she was honored to be on one of the world's largest stages and to represent Latinos and Latinos from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" were on one stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American Football season. The game and the mid-term show are among the most seen TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently fallen to the audience: this February, the spectacle in the US attracted the few spectators for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
The mid-term show of the last Super Bowl had been in the run-up: In the fight over the handling of Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to the media reports, Topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the mid-term show - the reviews were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was on his knees in the 2016 / 17 season before NFL games in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick started a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African-American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been ununited since March 2017 and has no longer contested the NFL game. He is throwing an alliance before him for political reasons not to be present.
Cook-broke: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to be expensive to break the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. There is a threat of high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. The credit suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, and Credit Suisse would probably have to write a total of up to £1.8 billion (about €2 billion) on their books, according to the report. This would have been estimated by the consultancy company AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of between £900 million and £1 billion and the lenders between £550 and 825 million, and the amounts actually to be written down should be at the top of the band, an expert told the sheet.
The size of the losses of the creditors will actually be shown after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not spread too much hope. For example, the about 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the real estate is in bad situations. Most of the money could probably be taken out with the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
The sea-watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any secure information on it," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the dpa news agency.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy, who were accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in Messina. Newborn stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they had left on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29, and a ship of the Italian financial police was jammed, and the three suspects are said to have arrived there on that day, and the captains are under investigation for aid to illegal immigration.
USA Federal Government warns against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government of trusting Huawei in China's network equipment.
We believe that the risks are too great, "said Pai the" Handelsblatt "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law 'which obliges each company" under Chinese case law' to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also forbids companies to inform third parties of such requests, "the FCC chief continues, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to require suppliers to have a "declaration of trust."
Berlin first wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "Handelsblatt" reports on the basis of its own information.
Pai doubted that this was possible. The 5G technology was not only hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, "said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
The Chinese group Huawei is accused of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership of the company is opaque. The employee company, which is supposed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, "Pai said to the" Handelsblatt. "
The US had knowledge of government employees being placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to promote the position of the US.
Chemical factory in Northern France burns: schools closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall lights up the sky over a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleaning up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In 12 municipalities, the institutions would not open on Friday in advance, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no casualties. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday night, as the prefecture reported. There is still a risk that after the deletion smell will spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 fire-fighters and 90 police and gendarmes were in use at the place of fire.
A giant black smoke column had previously been raised from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizole factory, which is the addition for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the Normandy factory belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The Prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river, dams were built against the pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire had broken out in the early morning at 2: 40, the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, "said Le Maire on Thursday night at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the euro area was weak, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse in order to make the necessary decisions. "
The countries that had budget margins for more investment would have to act, said Le Maire, for example, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these margins, the Minister added, and pointed to the high level of public debt of his country, which is more than 98 per cent of gross domestic product. French public debt had to be "stabilized" and "reduced," said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly made appeals to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is thus responding, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evades question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "surrender law" adopted by the Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering himself to the question of whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the last law adopted by the Parliament, which is to prevent it. On a question in front of journalists, Johnson only said that his government would comply with the applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law" that makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister, John Major, had expressed the presumption on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a process that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's departure. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October and the best way is the one with an agreement."
In the meantime, Johnson's chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, said that he felt that the political disputes about the Brexit were a "walk in the park" and was confident that the EU's departure was still coming about: "We enjoy this, we will win, we will not be worried (note d. Red: from the EU)," according to the British newspaper "Telegraph," said Cummings in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the campaign before the EU referendum in 2016, is now the head of Downing Street, the British government's headquarters. He is to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister into a situation that was almost impossible.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers, but it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Bags) is deeply immersed in the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrative guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-front-wife Chrissie Hyende.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote to Instagram: "# ThePolaroid Diaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found for photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, a few hundred of them are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries."
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s until the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," the art critic Ekow Eshun writes in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the center: her husband Paul - as one may have never seen him before.
There he danced with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, on the phone in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing unshaped moonboats. Sure, the McCartney's were an extraordinary family, but it also had a very normal life on her farm in South England or in Scotland. So, according to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made out of old potato boxes. And it was not always clean with the McCartney's.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision-making click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to knit it at the exact right moment, "said Paul McCartney." If you knit two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. "And Linda would have had the gift of always catching the right moment." She simply knew that she had it, "said Paul in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the excerpt and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, in addition to all the anecdotes, where landscapes already seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road," which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had "withdrawn" because of the US threats.
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly following a nuclear programme and not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of the Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased significantly.
US government wants to limit reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is an incision of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the US would continue to be committed to the support of refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
In future, the US government will focus on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been in danger, as the Foreign Ministry's statement shows, but a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be received from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The programme set up in 1980 will select refugees from UN camps all over the world and be reestablished in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Even the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was just under 85,000.
Relief organisations reacted horribly to the announced reduction in the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would continue to damage its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US - both legally and illegally - and the US government is expecting 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year, according to its own data. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Get close to a snitch"
US President Donald Trump has accused of spying in the Whistleblower affair. Whoever has given the informant, who has accused him of abuse of power, "comes close to a snitch," said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This is consistent with several US media.
According to this, Trump spoke to employees of the American UN mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he said, "This is close to a snitch." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers considered the latter to be a possible reference to the death penalty. Democrats were strongly critical of Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a congressional investigation into a possible withdrawal procedure against him, the presidents of the committees for foreign, secret and supervisory services in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower, in a complaint that has now been published, accuses the President of having abused his office in order to request an intervention of another country in the US election in 2020. In particular, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: in the conversation Trump suggested to him to initiate an investigation against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower itself and its informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Kneeled refugee boat: baby and young children drown in Aegean
People are constantly trying to get from Turkey to Greece across the Aegean Sea, and the often too small boats are often in the process. At the end of a tubular boat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died at the end of a tubular boat. Among the death victims were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could be saved from the floods of the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also supposed to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the north-east of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The countries from which the migrants come are not yet known. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey move to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in much too small boats. According to the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route last year.
The Who Abort Concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has found a sudden end because of an inconvenience of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. In the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should let it go as long as it still works."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey "can't really talk now." The audience promised Townsend to get at his expense at a reparation concert, but an appointment is not yet set.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said no. They should be brought up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band-mate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rent suddenly set: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office rental company in the world.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small start-up to a driving force on the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords must fear for billions of dollars.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. A few days ago, the company's founder Adam Neumann had cut off as head of the company, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiary companies and values such as the private jet for the managers to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reported that WeWork had stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect, among other things in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it to members in some small units in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small start-ups or whole departments of large companies. So far, WeWork is burning money at a breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company has taken a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. In this year alone, the rental costs by the rental of ever-new areas have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new company is now expected to have pulled the emergency brake and to have stopped the new land rental with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times," WeWork has now concluded lease contracts with a maturity of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for whole real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhad, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months, almost 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWorks' new contracts alone made it possible for the demand for offices in New York to be greater than the new areas on the market at that time. Without WeWorks' expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased in that time, as Alpert wrote in the "Insider business," as it is now in London, where several dozen office locations are in the best position.
In the British capital too, the balance in the real estate market could be significantly reduced without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office house bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their real estate to the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off a part of the expected billion-dollar income. Despite the long-term rental contracts, they do not have access to the WeWork reserves, which are already scarce, because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by extra-established subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, which are only in limited limits for the parent company.
Russia once again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 poachers who had been illegally fishing in the waters had been arrested, according to the Russian domestic secret service FSB informed Interfax on Friday.
It was only ten days ago that 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Before that, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injured, it was said. The Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on the road in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard, according to its own information, is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources. In the re-controls, 30,000 squid fish were discovered. In addition, the information on three fishing and two motor boats was confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the Coast Guard found a total of over 8,000 infringements in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of North Korea fishermen have been arrested there for some time in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow-scale synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small living beings out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be destroyed. Even the ships themselves would not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
In the last week's arrests, according to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean later died of his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first set a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
United States impose entry ban on ex-president Castro
The US has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "gross human rights violations," has established a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also guilty of human rights violations there by the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had issued a ban on entry, among other things, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, a bitter power struggle has been raging between the government and the opposition. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The Socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the road again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia should start because of the time shift before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how great the global commitment will be on this Friday after the record participation of the last week. Tunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people have strived for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries in the framework of the strike week, she added.
A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had taken part in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, a rally is planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt, people want to go to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, in August 2018, Thunberg had sat before the Swedish Parliament in order to call on the politicians of her country to make a more active use of climate protection. This was the result of the Fridays-for-Future movement in a short time. The climate protests were mainly attended by students and students, but increasingly also by scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against Earth's heating and the threat of climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
Tunberg had arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic Törn with a high-sea race yacht, where she had recently participated in United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she was very much in the conscience of the world's leaders. In her home country, Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelhood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
The people of Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This will be a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Emergency Affairs on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass Agency. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Those who smoke, however, must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette is to ignite a fire, the penalty is higher. Under the ban, the Ministry says that candles are as burning as they are. Also, to grilled meat on the balcony is not allowed.
Blow against cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time lifted a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 offenders are suspected to have hosted numerous web sites through which international criminals operated their activities as operators of a data centre in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle.
This was reported by the Prosecutor General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
The clients of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second-largest Darknet drug market, "Wall Street Market," which investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the Cyberbunker according to the General Prosecutor's Office.
It was said that such a host had been lifted for the first time in Germany. A web host provided the infrastructure for an internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to take part in a major rally in Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests - Who are the Thunberg's hintermen?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl, of all things, is holding the mirror before the people of power of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or wise marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpower or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person is able to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has been chosen to work for a more just world. At that time, he has also been able to win a group of young people for himself and has persuaded them to cross the sea in order to get to the promised land, similar to a sailing boat to the United States.
But is there a shadow side in this respect? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at its side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reaching, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Even the old-established followers of Greta Tunberg were a little bit of a bit of a disarm over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick. This is not unwell, because the action was in the world's money and thanks to the media.
Here the spirits now separate: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work with stock brokers during the world-saving action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question seemingly religious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: a foreign comet is now crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet of another star is now crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his explorer 2I / Borisov and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer called Gennadi Borissov on the Crimea. He looked into the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get insights into a foreign solar system from close proximity. Apparently, the coming is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar in origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbial path that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that, the astronomers can observe him in detail. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be examined from the Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnochia of the US Space Agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be seen with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumumamua."
First insights about Comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be between 2 and 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comet - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León says, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets could form in other solar systems through similar processes to those in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
The researchers are constantly busy with asteroids. Only recently a giant asteroid passed the Earth and was dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely repulsive": Rachel Johnson is appalled by brother
First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, in clear words, scourges the Prime Minister's warlike language as "tasteless." It is not the brother she knows.
"Surrender," "fraud," Treaty: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is still on the move - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this came up with a massive indignation of the opposition, and more critics have now spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the radio station Sky News that her brother used words like surrender as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal should be "hung, drawn, divided, tested and feathered." She considered that to be very reprehensible. She did not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had stood up for the "Change UK" anti-Brexit party in the elections to the European Parliament.
She was particularly concerned that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly House member who had been murdered by a Neonazi a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum. Their memory was best appreciated by the Brexit, who had said that Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized John's sister. The culprit had obviously come from the extreme camp, which "is very much the one she felt very grieved for."
The widower of Cox also strongly criticised the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor her was to stand up for what you believe in in in a passionate and determined way - no matter what view you are. But never to "demonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had been created in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory Member. "I have been torn up in recent months between loyalty to the family and the national interest - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained the step.
John's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language "which is not worthy of this country." In a joint statement, they said, "In the past few days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside Parliament. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: in the mid-term show of the coming Super Bowl, two women with latino roots appear. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the next final of the US Football League NFL. The organizers announced this on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will be celebrating its 100th birthday next year, will be held in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl is putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This is sending an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000's, she ended up with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" great hits and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She made her global breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever."
The announcement of the mid-term guests is expected in the US every time with great excitement. This year, many people also regard the selection as a political gesture. Finally, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones have been furors there. As a rule, there are over 100 million TV viewers watching the NFL final, and it is now very popular in Germany.
Last year, there was political controversy in the run-up to the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who, in protest against police violence against black people, had refused to rise in the play of the national anthem and had been hard-hit by, among other things, US President Donald Trump. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticised by many.
An actor and Youtube is increasing Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali, however, would rather stay abroad for the time being.
The two men who have had an influence on whether blood is coming back on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of the two hovering back at Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfatah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In 2013, the ex-general, who was the Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, who was the first freely elected head of state in the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: President Donald Trump had been in charge of the political action and had no reason to be afraid of the people in Egypt who were not in a position to be in a position of security in the country, "because they had not been in the last few days in Egypt."
In the view of the President, the other man who currently determines the events on the streets is trying to mislead him. Mohamed Ali, of course, has remained abroad, where he discards the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him when he was trying to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the toning voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, the living rooms and tea rooms of the country: with his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" calls up to his countrymen against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in a quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is in luxury and let himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership on which Sisi is based, Ali accuses corruption and enrichment. Because he has been doing business with these very gentlemen for 15 years, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding clicknumbers show.
After having been arrested for the first time in the past week since Sisis Griff, for the first time, thousands of people had been on the streets after the power, and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million-march" for this Friday. The fact that so many people would be on the streets was unlikely, but there were some smaller protests, for example in Giseh, in Cairo and in the village of Kina, in Luxor. The police did not stop their protests, and the police did not stop their protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile delta, where demonstrators cut banners with the President's portrait last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the downroads. In Cairo, several underground stations were closed in the city centre for "maintenance work," most of the streets around the Tahrirplatz, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which 2013 supporters of the disgraced Muslim brother Mursi, until the army killed them were to be held out for the future, a large party was expected to hold out of the fire, and another discontented party.
Mohamed Ali led these arrangements to a change in his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona. "Let's not come together with police officers." But it is not to be understood as a setback: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than the provider's application, there are different testing options.
If you enter into an Internet contract, you do not need to be blind to the speed data of the providers. Customers can check for how much of it is actually achieved in case of any incident.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer centre of Bavaria.
If the connection seems to be more and more slower than the service provider, there are different test options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the service providers' tests are carried out according to provider-specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objective," the consumer centre of Bavaria is to be considered on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable time limit of usually 14 days for the provider to produce the promised performance. This is best done in writing by the person concerned.
If this does not cause anything even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and may also demand damages. However, if there is no success, only the appeal will help.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has spoken out for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before taking measures - an impediment procedure can lead to the withdrawal of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the fact that Trump has repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a telephone call to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far held back on criticism of Trump for the Whistleblower affair; few have been uneasy about it. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy on several occasions, such as the easing of environmental protection rules and the tightening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: More Marvel-Film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avenger" universe. It was completely unclear how the films around Tom Holland should go on.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is consistent with several US media reports. The film will be launched in the USA as of July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's path is being continued in the MCU. I and all of the Marvel Studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how is the sudden good news coming? Sony Marvel is supposed to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which also includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of coming Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
So Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the United States has now reached the big final. In the last episode there were many happy ends and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked in the series for many years, was in a charming way tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series final.
One thing ahead: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a last farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess showed again. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his sown sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is heading straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachiel Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a very important comment about his suit. Whether he actually overthrew himself a Gehrock, the dignified Harvey of the bridegroom wants to know only then to note: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in a boat accident
A baby and four other children have drowned in the censor of a refugee boat in the Aegean. In total, seven people died in the disaster, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he will visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens, in order to be able to help to deal with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson from the European Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofer with EU Commissioner for the Interior Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister for the Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece there are still an unusual number of migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, it was said by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased figures have raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants illegally coming to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each Syrian who has been deported.
However, due to the lack of staff, the processing of the asylum applications is only difficult on the Greek side. In Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are almost 29 400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact came into force in March 2016 had it been so many, reported the State Rundfunk.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to medical practitioners, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "quite sure" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. In particular, the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature changes within a short time and led to more heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo-pot
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has remained quite a long time unnoticed - and finally it has been noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never been held by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Green. On the party's website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had been published before and also spread to the media - and the cup was still a bolder (papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to answer for photo-pot
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party is producing fake news to be more credible in the subject of "environmental protection," and this in the middle of an election campaign for the Lower House election, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribe scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and started the discussion about fake news. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their leaders to hide their disposable cup."
May was shocked and adored on her blog that she had not known about this action. In order to underline this, she posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, she was right, she was from bamboo. She always had it with her. A party spokesperson said that it was only about putting the party logo in the picture, and not to cover it up. The photo on the website is only a part of it.
May writes that it is her suffering for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time she asked her over-committed team: "If they want to work a picture again, could they not do something with my face so that I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of flight travel - but their pictures were not fotoshops. Thus the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de * reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Life-long flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng had been promised an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the business class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the economy class for free.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: a self-declared Influencer has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng will follow more than 65.000 users. On May 30, it flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the way to the airport, Jaqueline's employees refused to upgrade, even though they had shown an email in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter wants to have received the Influencer from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK were skeptical: they were listening at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail was supposed to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not show up.
The airline employees at the airport can-do jaqueline ticket and imposed a life-long ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the Influencer turned to Elliot Advocate, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not enter the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay the Influencer has committed fraud, it remains closed for future flights. The terms and conditions of the airline also say that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices give in to Yemen according to the report on the ceasefire
The oil prices fell by more than a dollar on Friday afternoon in a short time. Last, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American type West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The reason for the course slide was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a truce in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a truce in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought to a halt five percent of the world's oil production in mid-September. The Hushi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had called the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would disarm the political tension in the region.
If an agreement was to be reached, it would be possible to focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy Division at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The price of oil continues its downward movement of the past few days. A week ago a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
The last time Bloomberg had reported, by reference to insiders, that after the attack in mid-September, the repair of oil plants in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected. Thus, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original amount.
In the last few years, there have been press releases calling on insiders who report the rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. But raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and is trying to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was indicated in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest of Iran and the recent release on the way to the port. The crew are now preparing to leave, while the ship is still on the verge, the shipping owner Erik Hånell told Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the US announced that it would move defence missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as an Iranian archenemy. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and the United Kingdom had at times significantly increased oil prices in recent weeks.
Arguments against Trump are getting worse
In the case of the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, a cover-up against the White House has been made loud. Several leading government staff would have made an intensive effort to prevent a "cover-up" to the White House after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. Trump spoke of a "witch-hunting" by the spokesperson of the House of Representatives.
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute. According to the agency KCNA, the sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday.
The US had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the consultant of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticised increased US sanctions and the common military manoeuvres of the US and South Korea. He hoped, however, for a "wise" and "courageous" decision of Trump to bring it back closer.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit should bring with Kim before he came to the conclusion that the negotiations for disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers should help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry, dressed with a blue splinter-protection vest in Angola, symbolically lit and destroyed an explosive mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Conduco, he made the ignition circle. At a safe distance the explosive exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola free of mine by 2025, he later called in front of running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but they did not help to get out of the house to help."
Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of the early fall in interest rates, the pound is losing its value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculations of an early interest rate reduction of the Bank of England (BoE) are increasing to the pound sterling. On Friday the British currency reduced by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars.
The sales were the result of statements by the central banker Michael Saunders. He discussed a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered to be the advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, Analyst Ricardo Evangelista from the Brokerhaus ActivTrades said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy of the Brexit hickhack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, if necessary, wants to take his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement as of 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were being forged.
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been revealed in Russian sport. The Wada had closed the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, had some 270 athletes in the country under neutral flag, and at the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. Even at the World Cup in the various sports, they were allowed to be present, and in the summer the World Cup was held as a host in Russia.
Positive findings missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples in question. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes later. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed, however, that the Doping Data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that Wada has received from a Whistleblower, and those that they have received from the Russians in January, many of the positive findings in the McLunden report."
The World Cup is not affected
This is confirmed by the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organisation to hold on to Russia's banner. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will start under neutral flag. They have to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and are subject to tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put in place manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new blockade of Russia and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
