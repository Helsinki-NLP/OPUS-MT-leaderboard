The Prague Stock Exchange is falling into the minus against the closing of the business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of the Tuesday business, was linked to the break-in from Monday, when it fell by a further six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market's response to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, is shown.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, the shares on the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic case, although the indices were able to compensate for some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points over the business day, but later it was able to make up for a part of the losses, thus reducing the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan decreased by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing for the US rescue operation is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the Hong Kong monetary authority Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, even though it belongs to China, determines its own monetary policy, that is, independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial support.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will also be affected by the break-in.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, with a similar break-in last in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little evidence that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index had a free case.
Congress makes concession: US government is allowed to pump $700 billion into the banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a wider form of agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
This will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators achieved a breakthrough in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial contribution to the American financial system of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
However, this does not yet mean a victory.
The Congressmen have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The Financial System Support Plan will be negotiated in the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, of the Reuters Agency, said this.
In the Senate, different figures suggest that the plan could probably be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first major psychological factor in the recovery of the financial markets.
But then there is a "disillusionment" due to the complex mechanisms that could be used to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a market stabilisation package should look like, "said to the Bloomberg agency, the democracy Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies that are putting financial firms in serious losses and are jeopardising the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which will have to be effective on the market.
It is necessary to continue the health plan, but I think we are at the target, "says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators have tried to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is to reassure the investors of their business in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by the Congress could affect the business on Monday.
However, it is not yet quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also a lack of clarity as to whether the negotiations at the last minute could not still be a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount to be allocated to the system will be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with a further 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations positive
The President has a right of veto in this decision, but the Congress can overvote his veto.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme has remained, based on the acquisition of finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We have worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also pleased with the progress made.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "appreciate the two-way effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to supervise the Fund.
The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for this.
"We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects help for home owners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that is because you do not know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses, "Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz. server.
In Marek's view, whether the plan is being adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not crucial.
"It is much more important that the Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on adoption is the most important thing at this moment, "Marek said.
Duel on Messer's cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you in your choice
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can yet call.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
In spite of everything, there are enough reasons why you should get an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
I'm sure it's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also simplified with the music on travel, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but also a pink floyd fan will hardly be able to handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even make any sense.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures.
But the universality of the mobile phones also has disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than 10-12 hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect the cheap phones to be able to play music no longer than a few hours.
If you are still on the phone every now and then, you would rather buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one recharge.
Another problem is if you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB closure, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without a reduction.
With players you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most of the mobile phones and players themselves create a music library, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only display the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should especially ask about the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and of course also the comfort of the operation.
For you, music is mainly a backdrop and you only listen to it for a short time every day in the tram, for example, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which is what almost every cell phone can do.
You don't have to control the music formats that a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or other provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in itself for why you should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is poor and is usually limited to fast radio kits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that in the future the music industry will be dominated by this type of selling of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet).
Most of the people carry the phone.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
It is important, however, whether you carry headphones or at least a wireless free-speech device.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker that has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The greatest advantage of the music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand kroner.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really be operated by anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an erroneous mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous account for data transfers.
Which device should you now grab
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
In the case of the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you will not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, rather take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the user comfort comes up to that of a single MP3 player.
The broadest is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players of the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, and the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual provider who forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be waiting for much longer.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers are working on the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This was also confirmed by the ČTů telecommunications authority, which drew attention to the fact that the price of a text is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the European Commission's last steps in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - for some customers of Czech mobile phone operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a battle announcement.
It may sound paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, are happy to see that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority, Pavel Dvořák, who has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, he would probably find hardly any more frequencies).
But there is one more possibility - a virtual provider.
The entry of virtual suppliers into the mobile market resulted in a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile operators had to respond.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market in the UK, there were similar votes as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February of this year we reported on the launch of the virtual provider of mobile services in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the country's fifth largest supplier.
The financial group Penta, which in the Czech Republic owns, among other things, U: fon, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to be able to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profit as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobile commerce in Poland shows, it can also be a rather good move to focus on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically targeted at men.
"Real guys choose mobile - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be found in the Czech Republic.
The press spokesman of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services. "
In the Czech Republic, mobile phone operators mean
But it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
It will be more of a market entry of mobile services in other countries in our region, "says in a phone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press officer of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
For a long time now, the GTS Nowa group has shown its interest in starting a virtual mobile service provider, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of company customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them, "said the press officer of the group Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe better times are coming.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specifications in relation to other markets.
No subject has yet addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area, "says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specific features of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in a rare way to the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to continue to build."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile, hardly a virtual provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this moment we would have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think in the short term. "
Vodafone is more focused on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is precisely what we consider to be the best from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet. "
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, and another would be more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus to a fall in profits.
So why should one make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can draw on a line when it comes to something also shows the long back and forth about the creation of U: fon.
The most likely pressure in the direction of ČTů was the company T-Mobile at the time when U: fon was on the market.
This is also confirmed by the publicly available information from the ČTů web pages.
But now U: fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová said: "The bankruptcy of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile service provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would put high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services. "
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not only the ČTů's attitude, which unfortunately, unlike the UK and other highly developed countries, does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
The Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS) is the sole body of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition.
This, however, referred to this whole problem in its very typical way.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile service provider would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers, "said in his reply to our question Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a formulation would not be surprising by the representatives of the providers.
This is more than a matter of concern to an authority that represents the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a country where virtual providers work in a normal way, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services."
It is likely, however, that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking that the three mobile operators are almost already in line, which is the result of their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same price of petrol at the gas stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence of any action against competition in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so it does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for its action on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications, "said Chalupa in its statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČTů, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators will have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if this argument is not followed, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are very similar.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Nowa) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The shift of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a rather common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS dissociates itself from the whole matter.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted amendment of the Telecommunications Act, it has not been possible to enforce the extension of the ČTū's powers to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must only know that too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right if no one looks
The functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are more than one in the Czech mobile networks, is not taken into account.
They are companies which issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partly public.
They are usually companies operating in the field of multi-level marketing.
For example, own mobile telephone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company is a classic company customer with the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the relevant society," replied Martina Kemrová to our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not talk about the responsibility of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these companies do not give them negligible profits, and at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all these companies' services are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone in their name, so they cannot fully have it like the normal customers of mobile phone operators. "
But this alone would have to be at least strange.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
Do mobile operators keep an eye on such a procedure, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of the providers that they do not know and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been pointed out several times in the text, the entry of virtual suppliers has led to a significant fall in the price of the various services.
In virtually all countries, where virtual providers have been created, the traditional providers have tried to prevent their creation from being virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was at these very moments that the regulatory bodies, which by no means tried to protect the interests of mobile operators but of their customers, were involved.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved the first virtual operator, and this followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing up the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that inclarity in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we do not throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again soon.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not be making more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem where is my country on the occasion of the day of the Czech state in a ceremony.
The hymn was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The song was written by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The workers of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can now listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
In the past, he had told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are striking and popular.
"From the very beginning I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that a harmony can be established," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem will take its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first recorded in 1834 on the stage of the "Städdetheater" in the original Czech play "Fidlovačka" by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was made by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
On Wednesday, the Prague transport companies will also transport to a chip for the first time.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of the Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers will enter a subway, tram or bus, who will carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the Chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and be able to play it on their chipcard at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylasy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons have also been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait for their paper tickets regularly in long queues.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, it is recorded on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, a switch with trained staff is also available to the travellers, who will advise interested parties on the Internet purchase and will also record the coupon on the map," said the spokesman of the Martin Opattný project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the Opencard, which are installed in some U-Bahn vestibules.
What do those machines look like?
They are red, remember a ticket, the passengers may have noticed them in the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"At present there are five of them in the city, but it is supposed to be eighty by the end of the year," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls a machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You just have to insert the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon is playing itself.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban slopes and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In the trains that are part of the Prague integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading equipment to check the validity of the coupons after time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization. This organisation is the one to set up the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's checkout.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked position at the side of the checkout.
The driver controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the recorded coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," said Drápal.
A passenger who does not use suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudden demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the integration of the Bohemian Forest into the United States.
This is the result of a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were said to have turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is, among other things, the result of a letter that has been preserved in a private archive, which is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is said in a letter signed with the words "people who have the fate of the people who are the heart."
As the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the Bohemian Forest for today and for ever.
"We cannot believe that, without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you will be able to speak to a state that is foreign to us, which is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has not contributed anything to the victory of the Allies," is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the "Czech oppressors."
If the US President had doubts about the sense of the Böhmerwalddeutsche, it would be sufficient for him to initiate a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the US or live under the United States's rule of protection.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of the post-war history, it is in the opinion of some witnesses of the time, however, it is a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had at least to suspect that they would be negotiated on their deportation from the Republic, few of them had such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudden.
Again, others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was a German in the Baltic Sea Navy during the war.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," said Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
Most expensive action on the streets in Czech history.
This is also the way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš řebíček promises to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million kroner will be on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
She is supposed to take the drivers off from too fast driving and drinking at the wheel.
And they also remind them to belt on before driving.
The campaign is particularly concerned with young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a sign.
And then the word "pay" is in a blood lobe.
This means that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see normal pictures of the victims of the accident.
It is expected that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Bread and whip for the drivers
"The motto of sugar bread and whip applies to the drivers.
Sugar bread means that if they drive in red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk, "said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
In his opinion, even less effective are boards that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you put up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken out in favour of the return of virtually all the areas occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if it is possible to make peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for this.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the daily Jedichter Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We have a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has done, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templar and holy and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work, "he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert was in favour of a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria only on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to do to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "the Prime Minister stated.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency company near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to go and walk on the bus.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the work of a steward is in contradiction with the law on road transport," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting at this moment for all misfortune next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply when the steward is running coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is also equipped with standing places according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided for in the bus, the passengers will have to sit.
The long-distance travel buses of Student Agency have no standing places; as confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travellers.
Later on, this has been withdrawn and we have reached a consensus that passengers are allowed to go to the bathroom when they have their seat, "he said.
The law knows no steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
There is, however, no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the concept of vehicle attendant, but it does not define its rights and obligations, "the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
The Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, thinks that the law will cover this problem later.
"It is important whether the bus also has standing places in the product authorisation.
That's all, "he says.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, public transport buses with standing places and a higher allowed speed and distance travel buses without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, the expert says
The BESIP road safety specialist Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid mode of transport, there are not many risks, the situation is similar to the service on board an aircraft.
Here too, it is not certain when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can hit his head. "
"However, if a bus is a sharp brake, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like the city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by means of internal regulations, "he says, and also thinks that this problem is not fully solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to provide services to stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider their profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to the passengers when they get in.
That would also reduce the costs, "he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin founded the lack of stewards in his bus. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We have no stewardesses, against which we have been fighting from the very beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident, "he had said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had died, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the road without blinking and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura claims that the two places were sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but will expect financial compensation from the guilty.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more detailed regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a 30-member team of experts of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the top speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving, "says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the work of the stewards to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of the passengers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of the buses being the responsibility of the police and the health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the staff of the House is not missing in great words.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf bank with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, it is possible to create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" (Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe), "the letter, which was announced on Monday, states.
WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further alliances in the national banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the hit WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also through the Federal Financial Services Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalia government has recently made clear, it is time to find a solution to the future.
However, WestLB has been talking about a link between the Deka bank, which knows savings banks because of their investment funds, and has been in the process for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas has let know in the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainz Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is half-owned by the Landesbanken and the savings banks' associations, has instructed the Board of Directors to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The discussions have, of course, just begun, as it is said at the financial centre.
The Deka-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, is one of the more important employers in the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first time it has been mentioned when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked like the Deka-Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba for a moment.
However, nothing became of this three-year-old.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed the participation of Helaba in it.
The other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been games of thought about a connection between Deka Bank and Landesbanken.
At the end of the day, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of the Helaba, had spoken out against the game of plans for a meeting with his house.
However, regardless of this, it seems that there is a need for the different houses of the public sector to be brought together.
After the national election in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to move closer.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure increases to further mergers, she is gradually running out of partners for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, even though she has been through the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkass- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, who is involved in the Helaba at 85 percent, has put a stop to a meeting with West LB at the beginning of the year.
If necessary, the Nord LB would remain.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the key question of the business model to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not been answered by the German Sparkass- und Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be disassembled, but it is not, of course, desired there.
So the letter from the board there also talks about the fact that a "total solution" for the house is in any case being sought.
How to get individual units together with the Deka-Bank is still going to show up.
The second winter weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca, the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, is a massively built bear-tiger and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest travellers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena's gonna give Luca a lap first, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus park next to the station Puorta Nuova, this evening four buses start at 23.45, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra," arrival is expected to be 6.30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, in a bus only Brazilian travel.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's not for Italians.
Marco, who is wearing a long coat with fur-zimitate food and a glasses with wide silver ironing, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, on the meadow during the day, at 10: 30.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, with the Bavarian purity offer, the health insurance and the German-language travel management - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And the buses are already rolling into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero."
There's no beer, not yet.
It'll be quiet on the bus, the travelers will sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
It is located in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian signs on the motorway 8 take a break just before Munich.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese on schedule at half past seven o'clock in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest," in Fraktur, next to the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Second: "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it's called running!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not at the front, or we'll block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to tip.
"The security people show that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave the places, they will be gone! "
Third, "get back here tonight at 6: 30," you understand?
And here we go to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap is bound as a sign to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a great Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be ready for the retreat.
It is the second winter weekend, known as the "Italian weekend."
There is no precise information on the figures; there is talk of 50 000 who are on their way across the Alps and who come into the beer tent, and 10% of all visitors are expected to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, and Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which has a national statistics, in which the Italians take the first place in front of the British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical services.
The Hofbräzte is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only in the past week.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word "relative" and that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis.
Because it has now entered the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate had to interest only the part that it also took.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is loss to the daughter Deppa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has given money, the state financier had refinanced himself extremely in the short term - which is no longer possible because of market distrust.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial operations had fallen to zero compared to the previous year's period, the income from investment in assets and certain securities, as well as the resolution of provisions in the credit business, had fallen by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from the repayments of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Deppa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the tax system and the business concern for group companies, had the profit decrease at around 16 percent still been moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former State-funded company had first speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been disbanded in Aareal Bank.
Because of the lack of funding in the traditional state, the Deppa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private and public investors (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciation, which will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
It had already been reduced by two-thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financing company since the Deppa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on the refinancing of the interbank market, as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among the banks has been largely sealed again, as the banks are hovering their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term financing for a part of the Deppa loan portfolio - around EUR 50 billion per year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are in the foreseeable future covered by the loan and the company is "shielded from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets."
It can be heard from other sources that the funds have secured the refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleisterung (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
In fact, it is not unthinkable that the funding must not be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be leaped out either.
After the bank was still before the insolvency on the late Sunday evening, the at least temporary rescue cannot calm the mind.
The share price falls by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the borrowing rates are quite good.
If the priority debt is hardly moved, the rates of the subordinated bonds are more pronounced.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo are affected and, understandably, the maturity beyond 2009.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds once appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant tightening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the Deppa.
As long as central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions will be repaid in due time.
Or, however, there is something that no one at present dares to hope for - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that are overtaken by the partial nationalisation, the risk of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
In particular, long-term creditors should prepare some sleepless nights to decide whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can, after all, use a final point to make a loss advance for future tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to introduce himself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
I had a good time before I left school.
I live on the edge of Tokio in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train to Tachibana High School for 40 minutes.
I had to find the way on my own. Fortunately, I was not lost.
The beginning of the class at the Tachibana does not seem as strict as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students will enter the school from eight o'clock until a short meeting with the teacher, the 'home room' begins at twenty to nine o'clock.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people, and I'm also a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, coming from Germany and having a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very glad that I had already started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all cuddled, gifted and waved and I have heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I've known that from my manga.
It belongs to the most important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute, sweet '.
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl next to me grinned pretty wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was quite disturbed.
Everyone was talking and giggling and asking me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of them unpacked their bentos.
My host mother had also made me a lunch box like this - that is something different from the oily German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumbers and algae salad, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I'm eating in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is certain that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then especially arouses - in the hope of getting to know the boy at the break snack.
I read about it in my Manga comics.
I'm curious if I can watch this.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said,
"Because it fascinates me."
After all, I've been most fond of reading manga for years.
And for me to better understand the comics and the culture in it, I started to learn a little Japanese.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a fable for tradition, customs and customs.
And you put great value on them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen. "
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a child flees in danger, does that mean she also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: a lot of animals also have feelings.
Only how could you check if they feel the same way when they behave similar to us?
For several years now, contributions by famous scientists have been published in the internet magazine "Edge."
In a series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far, where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of consciousness or, more generally, of consciousness, we enter inaccessible terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it turns itself dead, escapes or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists conclude on a similar subjective experience.
I do not believe in that, however.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the almost always associated circuits with the human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and the execution / control functions).
This wide region is much more developed in man than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity is likely to lie in the language nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, may be very different from most of our state of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or, because of the special hardware, analysed on the basis of our own experience, its research poses great problems to us.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which is likely to be scientifically easier to access.
One could study the awareness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one is more likely to move on to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the development of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I'm leading them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the brain-located defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) is proof of memory.
In this way, sentiments are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which characterize the primates and especially the people.
With the help of the words and the grammar, we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of the language nature, in order to ascribe them to others besides ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that feelings from more primitive activities in the body's regions of the Cortex and the brain's stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, is more concentrated on the brain stem.
Since this network had not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in intergenerational sensations.
In theory, I cannot object to this, but I think it is inexplicable.
Pankseep argues what appears to be fear in rats and people, is likely to feel this way in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and people feel the same way if they behave similar?
A child flees in danger if she also feels fear?
In my view, mere similarity of behaviour cannot yet prove a level playing field.
The neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but shabbs do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it for man, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even shabbs (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because the human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to research the emotional behaviour rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is waving here, provided that you measure the same in rats and humans.
As I do not research language and consciousness in rats, nor do I know any sensations, I do not know whether they exist.
You may think it's short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than run against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries. "
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
Even the number of EM stages may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at high speed now, "said the Ukrainian Association President Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There was "a serious risk that the PZPN would not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Several first-time players had been sentenced to forced descent for manipulation in the last season alone, and even the start of the league had to be postponed in the short term.
Impudent Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about private - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her captivated Dennis Quaid as adulterer.
He's foaming - and he's beating back.
Late Rosary War with the ex-married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had said for the first time about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She had only learned the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The reason for the development of the soul was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It was a vile thing," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News," that "Meg once again recovers and redenses the history of our relationship."
It is also "regrettable" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so close his submissions with the side-stroke: "My life goes on.
I am very happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well. "
Prices for air tickets and hotels down
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany have even become up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and nights in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following a rise in prices in the first quarter, has seen a significant fall in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities under investigation increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most significant trend had been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year ago.
The reason for this is the weak dollar rate, which has led to a "diminishing travel pleasure of American tourists."
Also, financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices, with an increase of 26.3 percent, even keep the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter of the year also showed an upward trend in air prices:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, passengers in the economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-distance flights even became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the prices of the economy-class air tickets decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first-class, the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices on German domestic flights have even halved.
The reason for the fall in prices was, on the one hand, the decline in economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the open-skies agreement, which liberalises air transport between the US and Europe, has increased competitive pressure.
The situation was marked by the removal of unprofitable routes for airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1: 0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV will be a table leader.
In the Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
From Kristoffer Klein enlarge break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lever on the latte.
His message was precise, she was convincing over his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the mid-term break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was the HSV's physiotherapist for almost three decades, and he has a higher reputation than some intertwined actor.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have been similar: Give me the gate two!
The implementation was not carried out.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell admitted Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have wanted it "more relaxed."
The 1: 0 (1: 0) is due to the head-ball hit of Mladen Petric (11); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol put together.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which indicated their club as a class prime.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this," said Marcell Jansen.
He is aware that the tabular intermediate certificate is more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team, with their late-committed access - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen, who was replaced by FC Bayern - is slowly found, but she is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol asked.
After the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to break down by 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points within one day in his history.
Later the Dow caught something again.
At around 20: 30, the world's most important stock market barometer recorded about five percent in the minus at 10,579 meters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at more than seven percent in the minus at 1548 points.
The largest loser was at the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs were down by just under 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the company.
The purpose of the rescue plan is to provide funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage documents.
The sum is to be paid out, however, not in one blow, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive share options from the financial companies, which could be redeemed in the event of appropriate price developments in order to reduce the burden on the State Treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downward trend
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not address the doubts of investors.
The stock price of the German large bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and the Dax is ripping down.
The US Dow Jones index is losing despite the government's planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have torn the German Stock Index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The share of Munich's real estate financing, despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, temporarily lost three-quarters of its value, Commerzbank gave down by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000-point brand and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The world's stock markets have been on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors were afraid that the US government's $700 billion rescue package could not be enough to get the financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first trading hour or 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first declined by 3.2 percent, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index of Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61.
In Hong Kong, the slope-seng index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the lead index of Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 meters.
In the MDax, the shares of Arcandor were defaulted after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook are not sold.
Dark matter influences flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused a lack of advice: Dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein, could not be quite right.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of soon-feeding fuel lines, you are now threatening the cold soil.
For years, among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprised about for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100% in the way they would be expected under the old law of gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities at speed.
The probes are becoming unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called him Swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, might not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously an attraction, the effect of which can be observed on other celestial bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter is at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who have been deported to Egypt are said to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had called for several million euros of ransom.
A shooting before the release is said to have killed six hostage-takers.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
I want ransom negotiations to go on.
Over and over again, Germans are targeting kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who have been deported in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to the reports of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're checking her health, "said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were well and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom, "said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had requested a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, by reference to a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led a woman to kill herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trenise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had confessed to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he was regularly captivating his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
In a confession, Trerise wrote, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Ms. Randle was killed at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, at the age of 34 on April 1, 2007.
When she was a child in Coventry, she had been tied up and her eyes connected before he was doing sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
He and his wife divorced in the 1980s and moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
The court, however, learned that Mrs Randle, who worked a large part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was persecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been an eager surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given up her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter, who ended up like this: "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I did not sexually force her.
I feel responsible for her death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trenise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so. "
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, of her actions over the years on her daughter.
She would have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman. "
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act."
The man was seconded from the Department of Defense when he lost two very confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought it would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he issued contained classified assessments of Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies face B & B costs
After the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could have a cost of more than £80 million in the house.
The government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "unbearable" for the companies and their members to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans have been repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is counted each year to those 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted with caution are now being called to take over some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold and that the companies would have to pay together about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to obtain £81 million for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously during the real estate recovery are now called to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members of potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest is due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are both non-members, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
The people in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting company.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the February price increase, the big market price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the court's bail refused to have blackmailed 50 million Taka ($729.700) from a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several pending charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released for bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transitional government first give her full freedom.
The correspondents say that even though their suspension was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear, in the context of their release, whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says that she does not have to get a deposit because she is already on suspension abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the upper court. "
Their lawyers claim that they need bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the December elections.
It was expected that Sheikh Hasina would return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party leader said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government took over power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Concerns about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, said the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of people who are doing the vaccination.
BskyB loses action in the case ITV
BskyB has lost its action against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its share of the competing ITV station.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyB distorts competition and allows it to have an unfair impact on the ITV channel.
BskyB has acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's purchase of the share of ITV was in doubt about the independence of the ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communication office Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the US Public Prosecutor's Office
The US Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report was critical of the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The specialist investigator Nora Danehy is now to clarify whether the officials who have been interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal actions, have not been fully investigated or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the power to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 removed nine US prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors were dismissed due to low employment benefits.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleges, which led many observers to consider the cancellations politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of Democratic election fraud.
US prosecutors are responsible for investigating and prosecuting judicial cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be withdrawn for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been under fire because of the redundancies and has in the end resigned his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report by the General Inspector has addressed the role of Gonzales in a critical way by bearing the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, "giving up" its leadership "and" exceptionally disinterested "in the process.
Other officials, including President Bush Karl Rove's former chief advisor, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loafs epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell."
The singer, who will receive his special gold prize during the award next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title piece for Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's award, after it has been selected in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there are some songs that go beyond such things as time and genre and that "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice, which was delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and has reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he had collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute larynx.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obskure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of main roads, alleys, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
However, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time local residents to say where extra place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an active road.
There are no street signs either.
It's practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-patch Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be presented next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district leaders in the municipal council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want extra place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that the small road will be re-paved and set up seats for, among other things, a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the building protection department, said it was the city's desire to sell the road and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has kept some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is probably the most known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the blogger who write about the genrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised extra place as a rarity - a practically unchanged splinter of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Causes: A bitter nostalgic look at the dying city"), has published a part of the conversation about the city's history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and by the rain gutters flying past week-old newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like that recently in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti was on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of outstretched newspapers.
Some of the passers-by said they had rarely thought about extra place, but suggested that the road could be polished a little.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual training: education in English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, a leading scientific associate in Caliphonic studies and a leading director in the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection."
To address the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentioned that "the probability of successful completion of school among Afro-American and Hispanic students is lower than that of white students" - which is true.
In order to close this gap, Obama's education plan specifically recommends a bilingual transition period in education for those who first learn English.
However, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, is contrary to his interest in reducing the distance in school services.
Let's take the example of "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, an amazing 100% fourth-class student passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were rated as well in the English examination.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those that are preferred by Obama.
The sixth street school focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school is taking the approach to training in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama is supposed to take into account, says the school leader Linda Mikes.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical education.
Mrs Mikes, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, said to me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would be able to enter the classroom and no longer recognize it.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national associations of education have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and its own consistent support for bilingual training make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While he agreed that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by saying that people should stop worrying about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should take careful account of educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
The oil price is falling as a result of renewed economic fears
The oil price on Monday fell sharply because of the fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange have fallen by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak in July of $145.29 per barrel, they fell this month to almost $90 per barrel, and then again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets, to rise.
On Monday, investors again showed concern, even though Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan this weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup is expected to buy up the bank business of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place at the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
In a communication to investors, Deutsche Bank analysts have written that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they will continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the point of view of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have adjusted down their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year and have reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Interior Defender Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything after he's been in the Jets jersey more than anyone in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a unyielding game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which was in the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernes Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon in which her developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, which once slipped out as an external defender and the other once 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I have not worked very hard," says Cole about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think. "
While Favre and Cole were playing catch, the defense took down quarterback Kurt Warner.
External defender Darrelle Revis picked up an injured litter and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of warners.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had taken the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot into the 34-0 lead.
These were most of the points the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
In response both, because the jets allowed 21 points to be achieved in the third quarter without a single one, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time. "
Lured-out brisselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some of them think he is the best long-distance runner of all time, after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to make the 42.2-mile line in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2: 04: 26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least one world record or set a world record on every track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing out of fear, which may have been exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution could exacerbate its asthma problems.
Instead, he has signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - with the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish -, the average speed of the Gebrselassie is 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long-distance routes, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result of 2: 06: 05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his Wade two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train for a week.
It is obvious that after a break it has come back fresh and not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great. "
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he was overorchestrated, that he would avoid many world's best marathon stars in general, that he would rely too much on the race leaders as if it were a railway race, and that he would put world records above the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyan on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the line in 1: 02: 04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the Templars had failed.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last step to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2: 05: 36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2: 07: 48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2: 19: 19 the seventh fastest result ever.
The world record of 2: 15: 25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has planned her run in a wise way by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners tear out, but overtook after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2: 25: 01.
The pride and the strapazas in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the excesses of the amusement parks in the area of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic activity, is a quiet city in which the pride and complications of the Afro-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crocodiles, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
It's a pilgrimage place these days.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city that it describes is and remains - and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of depression by the Federal Writer Project - in many ways a place of the very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what's missing him."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many of them are still tired of being observed by outsiders.
"We are very much concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the city's oldest church.
It must be true. "
For a long time, Eatonville was defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other, an example of the black culture of the rural south, sometimes condemned and sometimes praised, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and careful.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her home town to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Floridareiseführer changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the locations of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Off the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always takes care of, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and whatever-fits to the hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty, full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like it."
One still remembers Hurtson here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston was brewed into the city, she usually did this without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today is imagining something on its venerable dress style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he was swinging in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking the lake of Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of hand.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
There was no great memorial in Eatonville, no big-style public readings.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbow," a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mingling brought hatred to the community.
"During this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the remote people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car. "
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request to force integration by calling its decision in the Brown case against the school council "offensive rather than respect my race."
Today, residents say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group composition in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged their teacher in the morning and they hugged their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"You did not embrace your white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists, who were beyond prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand. "
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set out on the way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her glory.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane long-distance road moved the city, accelerating the whole at the top speed, raising real civil pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd said it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more arrivals, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993, and locals began to reappreciate the past.
Eatonville was incorporated into the country-wide historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back of the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews a prior permission is necessary and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and is black men in the field - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their hidden community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival became bigger, an increased degree of home pride was born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed as any other race and people in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or in the police who, according to him, could use some help.
And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only go through here will think," Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others, "said Alondra Kenon the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York we speak a fluent financial Latin.
At first sight, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even know that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror working day since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal teas along the sidewalks with loud rattles and carrying tablets loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos still sniff between apartments around, like human packages loaded with around the 50 brushed T-shirts hanging on a joch-like bar on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagel on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a week's day between 16: 00 and 19: 00.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon, on the basis of all the world's end-of-the-day plan.
Although I had decided to put my order in time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal filial, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the money switches to take or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about the way to the Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the people before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with a license," stood for the same reason as I was in line.
Unlike me, however, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they were commuting, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state, and say that they treat their customers like family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks went down quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, went to bankruptcy administration and last Friday, New York went home for the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings worth $440 billion, was looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of another fall, the office and shop workers who were standing before me brought their cash to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
In the last few weeks, ordinary New Yorkers have taken on a running financial latin.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese regular supermarket took so much familiarity with Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and their meticulous-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my home block has come away from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to take a risko anymore."
Muslem graves dismayed during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Free Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Vlaam Belang Pertei, are taking part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamization."
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accused right-wing extremists of the burial in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at which extremely right-wing parties have significant profits in the country's parliamentary election.
On the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were seriously damaged in an action organized according to the police.
The perpetrators of the war sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to mask the motive of the extremists driven by the hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" about the news of the grave abduction that took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan is coming to an end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research to be carried out in Austria, after the country slid to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties who received almost 30% of the votes, were in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their claims were criticised by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, was in favour of a ban on headtowels and burkas and even made known his dislike for food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which say that the extreme right is the country's most political block, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
International travel stop for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam rock star, who was sentenced to the sexual abuse of children, was forbidden from travelling to France and Spain.
After informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France, Glitter ordered a six-month ban.
The Kent police were granted the right to impose an international travel ban last Thursday after presenting evidence to the judges of Glitter's criminal record of the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name of Paul Geld, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
EIn spokesman of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police at the Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent Mr. Paul Gad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Geld was not present in person. "
As required by the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The Kent police said it would not discuss individual cases or glitter's possible location in the country.
A spokesman from Kent's police unit said, "The Kent police will do all it can to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the Kent police to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country in order to minimise any risk that may exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse on two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to be able to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is calm and satisfied that Glitter was stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character," Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find for the personality typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they are not being entered into the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a series of theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame code presentation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of Flamenco, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is becoming ever greater from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
The normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to communicate on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus to move the audience.
In order to be able to hold on to the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco-masters with the photo camera. '
Bauer, inspired by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, went on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, gitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image selection function of the camera and the existing material, pictures were created that remind of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands Flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as' portraits of the veterans of sport '(' SportARTproject ').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer admits to 'I like to take pictures of people, to get to know them and to put me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a long time.
I think in the area of photography, the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You meet or meet people, people you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas. '
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is shown in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is writing is' a coldness'.
He does not yet know where the action of the novel is taking place and what it is about, but, Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a national from Ireland, who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is dealing with is' a daring 'and' everything points out that he does not have to write the novel '.
"If I were careful, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point," so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and gave the majority of the participants their voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who felt that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and a great sense of humour, had not enough time to be able to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature was born out of 'extraordinary desire for adventure', of 'joy in reading' and of 'more to experience' than before '; how he wrote and' maintains discipline 'to supplement' the lack of inspiration ', his work with documents, numerous corrections and overwork, as he has been the basis of his own, and the many of the many of his works, the many of whom he has been called to be the most important.
The hispano-American novelist admitted that there is' no way 'to measure and how to know whether books change life,' but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience ', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it' causes effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writers' not to leave themselves to ease 'and' take responsibility for his vocation '.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: bullfighting was partially out.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfight test, with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be completed, was moved to yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to postpone the bullfight.
Thus the festival was exposed to the constant weather, so two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, for which reason the second planned bullfight test could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
So there was only a party on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting.
And even worse was El July, which passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without glory.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience responded in his second fight with buh calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes to ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the town of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop and then they took the escape.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police followed them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Interior Ministry of the Basque State reported.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to perform the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped at the edge of the road after a few kilometres. At that moment the drivers got out of the car to escape over a country road into a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally caught one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to other police services for the precise laboratory analysis and the weighing of the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was' double ', so it did not agree with the mark given in the car documents, and therefore an additional arrest for forgery of official documents was made.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for questioning. He will be presented to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito in a rather strange way, the spokesperson of the California traffic police reported to the magazine 'People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear 'pressed through the gas pedal after 16: 30 and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking lot, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.'
A little later, the witness, who had probably not known the actress at the beginning, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she 'had to live for Lockears'.
When the police strike came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
'She seemed to be disoriented ', so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'Following the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' said the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and brought to a local detention centre at 7: 00.
Two months ago, after treatment, Locklaer was released from the clinic in Arizona, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the United Left Andalusian Association will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Education Association will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
"In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take responsibility for this," Llamazares pointed out what the party's approach must be to the one who has so far been a city council member of the Seville City Council.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the regulatory violations that Silva may have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases be given the maximum transparency'.
On this subject, he stressed that education has' a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
'Sangre de mayo ': Heroes of Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' is the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in the film, with about 15 million euros of investment for the filming.
In this way, the Cineast has "tried to present a lot of personalities and social analysis," which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the actors.
'Sangre de mayo 'with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later on the Telemadrid station as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis García, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this filming his' childhood dream 'was fulfilled. He has thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to make a memorial film for the second century in Madrid on November 2. Especially because the story is based on' Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, as he added, offers the 'unique possibility' to present the image of 'confused Spain', which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been brought behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of the VII '.
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to count on the financing as with 'Alatriste' or 'Los Fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as' Sangre de mayo '), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost all his career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in 'Volver a empezzar', has been involved in his ordinary way of working: he was on the stage with the actors, with whom you have to rehearse before you start shooting and for those who had not made a casting, he appeared 'humiliating' and creating respect, 'a part of the film director's profession is to provide help in the theatre and in the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you are working'.
Many of the actors he meets in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year is a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de bellar francés' and finally not the selected film 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
'In the beginning you think you work for the offspring, later you realize that it's only for the progeny, and now you're happy when you have produced another film, 'explains García after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recovers the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who also came from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women to fight for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and sat down for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which I thought was impossible."
'We are not trying to tell about her life, but to keep her Esprit, 'said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly ', for example, seemed like Guajira, or' the dance of the snake ', like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area, 'she says.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel on one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco-master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
"Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work and I am very honored. '
The production also includes musical composition and the gitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes on the role of the companion of the artists who were in love with Divas.'
This work also tells in a certain way about this woman's life, which became known in places as far as India, the United States or Russia, and also in the whole of Europe, even though she has normally lived in London.
"I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain epoch and whose works no one now knows and therefore even less appreciate her," says Bayón.
The performance will take place today at 20: 30 at the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the trienium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers a suitable atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture to celebrate the 'Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the International Congress, which is taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz," which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernerero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The US can't imagine without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them. '
This movement was made by the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and the then ruling idea of American cinema, which was abandoned, from all over America to Newman, came and followed with his inspiring idea.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
But it was a big blow to everyone.
'What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend, 'said Robert Redford crying,' my life and my country were the greatest tribulations of his life. '
No one was afraid not to be ridiculous or to exaggerate.
As a 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment in which there is fear of terrorists and of the market collapse, in which the depraved self-esteem of the US is in the hopeless search for reasons to get back dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue there are only a few people who can be admired, one does not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost impersonated a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered, like various losses, both profits: from the foundation that committed itself to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to its own brand of home-made and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it cost him a lot of effort to go against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of wonder suggests to take home high above Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The English Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar award winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"The greatest of us have left us," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to live today as Paul Newman lived: high demands on righteousness, a responsible private life, lead far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful to, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home? 'he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as he was of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive opas and the philanthropist, 'they say.
The streets in Madrid are poor for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, "Are we prepared for this?"
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with everything on it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you were to take into account the evaluation and I could check it, it would clearly not have been possible.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket-pick that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the road congestion).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is to go there only because of it) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less material?
All right, things like this are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks before, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to bring back.
It also looked like a 40-minute wait for rain, so it was a temptation to organize a public uprising and to attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output was misstamped.
Of course, if I was asked for a perfect road, I would never think of that road.
So I think we will still dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image identification system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as order a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft this is a route planner to move on the campus of the company). The system takes into account what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face identification system, this' receptionist 'can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were clothed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also place those present in the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not related to the group that is talking to her, and that there is no company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, a very superficial discussion was made about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, this will only be for the few.
Everything is only a statement, considering that Microsoft added one or other function and 'extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing in importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, this was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many of them pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of your 'death', not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'windows' environment.
What is the use of half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, less exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsoft is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without a doubt.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It is a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google to search the web.
By the way, last week, it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the Mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it on in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it is part of the clothing of a well-built priest.
When we start to list the countless stars, we can return to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard that had raised heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male cotton T-shirt, sleepless and tailled.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of his great name, even though it is called "Marcel" in the narrow circle, the legend tells that the name formation is connected to sport and was made by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel 'overcomes all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinct unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable), which have these T-shirts as a detail on the neck.
And attention, the Belgian company is not just focusing on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a pity to use it as an underwear.
You're very lovely.
"I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate."
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joy for life.
At the moment, the brothers and sisters Gruz take their new work in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris with the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her residence and also made the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn / winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50 and 60 years; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think it is, but in the end, everything is in one place and these areas have a lot of common ground.
Since I was a little girl, I've been excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house to walk around my aunt's clothes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to keep an eye on the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and at the rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designers and their professionalism.
You just turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
I don't know.
I feel better than ever, I feel good as a 30-year-old.
I think the woman is mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I've been trying to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
For a long time I have known that I am going to be a mother, because this is what my body demands, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and bring it up with a lot of love.
As for the art of film, you keep in mind the works in which you participated and which were filmed last year.
That is the case, and I very much want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and wants to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's all right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run-up to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothes from our collection were auctioned for Mango to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a hand stand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is necessary.
The drivers who can become redue because of the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, installed in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in the drunken state. If he is alcoholic, the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the General Prosecutor's Office. According to it, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for the reeducation of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers who were reported more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol were back in control.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the air and prevents the start of the car when the driver has taken the alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is found which is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposed the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the US in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices will prevent up to 65% of the standard infringements in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take action before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be implemented by the ordinary means, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The equipment is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, even though it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Deputies will vote because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17: 40, at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangars of Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the Spanish Air Force aircraft landed with the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but its rays have still forced the hand to use as a parasol to see the royal couple who got out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and the Princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time of year.
No, she's the Spanish woman, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and at the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy who give up the alps of honor.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long hair of the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps she was told that it was expected a thunderstorm in DF.
Before entering the room, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican TV is waiting for her to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no much-outstanding fashion designer and Bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a money price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m ².
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened, which are linked to the fact that you want to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table, which was organized by Mango, seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain, because his brother recently died, was tearing up. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some of the jewels of ELAH that were breathtaking. He was at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without a jacket, because Jackett lent them to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hastened to the business and had a pair of pants and a shirt that she had modelled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet rehearsals, so she got into excitement, remembered the old times, grabbed a bar and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always has a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed lacquers and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room with no odours.
The stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is not a thousand more, but one way to forget about chaotic everyday life.
And if there are a few, they are all collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7: 00 in the morning, but even worse is the idea of coming back into the hectic rhythm that the current life requires.
The office is called the voltage and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods of fighting daily exhaustion and the problems of turning off the world of work.
The number increases, however, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the whole list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 possibilities to relax' and so the rest that the book conveys comes into the bookshops of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Those who think it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual disproves such faith.
In addition, the methods of keeping in touch with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are offered.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer goes up to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality this has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Of course, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is not a single reason for this phenomenon.
Often relationships with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bedtime), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned before, it can be due to very high fibers, stress situations or overdemand.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak, whisper, or it may be quite an opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and consulted with a specialist in order to check whether there is a problem, which causes fear and in this way results.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnoea or with the stress).
What you can do is do a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to upset the child before sleeping.
So, quiet game for the child to choose and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and a little too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner rest.
It helps the child to sleep.
When speaking occurs in sleep once, try to keep quiet.
Remember that it's harmless to the child, and the next day it won't remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will take it out of sleep.
Although the child is speaking, it's sleeping, so it's resting.
Remember, if it is afraid after a pair of apparitions, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and to get more information out.
So you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child is sleeping, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don't tell the child that you hear this at night and know his secrets.
Not even for a joke.
It's a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses... finally
After a long period of thirst, Illhäuser is finally back on a success course on the field.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks played numerous goals and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers had trouble showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the host capital Kauffmann, whose distance shot was just past the angle, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and alternately it was first possible to make a foothold with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot to challenge the defence of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let the lively Riahi at the top of the storm through.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with two first-time goalchances, won by Riahi and Temporale, and right after that with the first gate for the Illhäuser by Marais, who was just right to take back a ball that had been defeated in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ilshäussian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, so his team mates had to continue to play under numbers.
Denmark, however, did not know how to use this and did not address any major problems to an ilhaeusian elf, which only retreated a little to 'compress' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour into Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to arrive at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by the Breton fishermen to take action in the face of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached an average record value of more than 1.14 euro per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon 'the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies to become competitive again and to ensure the conditions of employment and the payment of the seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they led the protest marches in the Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometres in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The Quiberon peninsula was bordered with a barrier.
As early as Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depot of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique disbanded the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting to be held in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue ', because' the fishermen will not give in at any point 'and' do not want to go to Paris', said Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the film-star and the committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer is keeping its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the imminent recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, is holding up its supply forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is very much hoping for the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, is considering giving more than 15% of its assets, thus paying back the $85 billion that he was made available.
AIG is ready to manage the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of the AIG met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained at the AIG.
The assets that AIG would possibly separate from include its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
As soon as possible, AIG must make sales to repay the loans of over 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives had rejected the plan to rescue the banks, a historical case of the courses: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of about 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As for the points, the strongest case of its history (684.81 points) had been previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final margin figures, the Nasdag index, mainly concerning technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the widely used Standard & Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan by the Chamber of Deputies, which was to allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 against, the Members refused the funds he had asked for to be given to the financial secretary Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'Here is a bad picture being put into circulation, which is the Congress's inability to adopt a plan, 'said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market was counting on this plan, 'she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be' too late '.
'If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the Fed's task (the American Central Bank, An. d. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further limit credit conditions, 'warned Brian Bethune, head of the economy at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza, while emphasising the feeling of extreme urgency, stressed even more that 'every day that goes out' brings with it the ruin of a financial company 'in the United States'.
After the Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the American authorities planned to purchase the bank business of Wachovia by its competitor, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are 'not only facing an American but a global crisis', the analyst added to the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown considerably.
The government's revenue within ten years has fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and the revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in the first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who was the winner of this, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this TV duel for the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats, which was to be followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which a five-point opinion poll was published on Saturday, according to Obama (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
In the still undecided voters, that is to say those that are now important, Obama was the winner of the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but this weekend she warned Bill Clinton.
The seventeen-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy in the foreground, and clearly underline the 'naivety' of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... ', he said several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to become president," he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican ad-ads since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself in a short and precise way, without being put out of the way.
He drew his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world of the United States has.
"McCain has still not understood, but Obama has already understood," this weekend set a democratic campaign against it, in which Republicans were accused of not having taken on the complete scale of the crisis that is taking on the 'American from the road'.
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in a raining rain at an election in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words' middle class' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is' the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain '.
After he had once again stressed that he would probably even manage to reduce taxes on 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates were concerned about the question of the plan to save the financial market of over $700 billion (EUR 470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that there was a choice in Minsk? '
The young and the opposition demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations in the Minsk market square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they have not chosen at all: 'What good is it if they do what they want with my voice anyway,' says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to the foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-distribution of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
"We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the count," said Juri Potemkin, the press spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition move into Parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent '.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, does not accept the election as valid.
She stressed that the number of candidates seems too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that an election has taken place?, the leader of social democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to be in line with the government's ideas. '
The silence of the night is down again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - The blood that got safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most secure and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has recovered public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI and hepatitis C virus.
In the light of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada launched a public investigation carried out by Judge Horace Krever, with the aim of bringing light to the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and of drawing up guidelines to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to give his report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for the management of blood canned in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started work, almost 38% of the people had confidence in the blood-reserve system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers.
The situation was discouraging.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood canned products and by working in this area over the following years, we have recovered public confidence, 'she says, before she proudly stresses that in the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Decary is aware that 'trust is something very fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At this time, we witnessed many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since the foundation of 1998.
And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we are looking at one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied if you do not know this and if a disease is only slowly progressing, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was being transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has quite a meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technology for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the NST tests, which allow the virus to be detected directly in the donor's blood, rather than the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not see it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmission of AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one of 12 million people is in danger of receiving HIV-infected blood.
'In other words, you have to distribute 12 million blood cells before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cones each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs in which HIV was transmitted through a blood conserve.
I believe that you can feel comfortable these days when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe to restore health, 'says the director of Hema-Quebec.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogens can get into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, just like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We have to keep monitoring ', Dr. Décary continues before she stresses that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Quebec also has to provide a sufficient supply.
The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
As cancer treatment is more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the blood supply network, which, on average, only 3% of the population suitable for the blood donation of Quabec. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older who meets the selection criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they have AIDS or malaria and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from the blood donation for a year.
'With these 3% we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
The lack of supplies is very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network when they become older and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give blood, but above all to hold them and to make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that it is rare to find the time to spend an hour donating blood, 'regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood canned, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively in serious fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical blood bank in Quebecs.
In the umbilical cord, previously considered to be a biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousands of umbilical blood samples, and we plan to lose more than a thousand per year.
"We should probably start to make it available for transplants at the beginning of next year," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical blood loss as very popular.
"Many mothers are convinced that they have no access to it ', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all the hospitals of Quabec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3-1-win (4-3 with all the goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second game of the quarter-final series in the Saputo Stadium, in which the total goal ratio was counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the USL's first league.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetieth moment of the game.
After a first half-time without a goal for both the one and the other side, midfielder David Teto and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one to get Matt Jordan in the way for the Sounders.
Let's remember that at the first game of the pre-and return series on Friday impact of the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had brought a 2-1 defeat.
In the semi-final, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
Saturday night, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3-1 deficit in the back-up in Minnesota by a 4-3 victory, but the Whitecaps moved into the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5-4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostizsyn drove the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Kostisyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this winning game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by shooting the only goal of the whole shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable. '
'He was too attached to it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause. '
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's partial election.
"Moving the course of our last big border in the north": This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular pictures of hydropower plants, mines, seen by Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great resources as during the parliamentary term.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out the fact that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his schedule was very full.
The 'North Plan' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister is supposed to have for Quebec, namely a 'new economic area', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned in recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was' a jewel with enormous potential ', but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At the most, some views of what more could be worked on: in particular, water energy, the forest, but especially the mining sector, benefit from the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charests, the north has' nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This' area twice the size of France 'is close to us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is in us', he stressed, as to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown very much by its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It's ours, it's our future, 'he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge card behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebecs area, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that was followed by all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, when the opportunity is available, I will take this position again on behalf of the government, 'he said.
In addition, "with climate change we must rethink our vision from the north," he said and talked about the Northwest passage, which will be accessible all year round due to the melting of the ice.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebecs would be very careful about them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist Member of Ungava) have already opened discussions on some thirty communities.
A committee of ministers led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Resources) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to 'create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as if it was a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister who was in office before him.
"Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development.
This was, by the way, one of the recurring issues of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the take-over of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who has reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest stressed that it was planned to be launched in 2012.
'This is between us, but I intend to be there, 'he entrusted to his party members, which was the cause of those beauties.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him by the law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was full, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend general meeting provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially 'constitutional objectives', which were easily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the 'special quabecs' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition included the North Plan's guidelines with scepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has re-established the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, it did not apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would have been much further today', Mrs Marois, along with her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), judged Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the government's adoption of a North Plan.
'But what we want is that this is not just a big idea, 'said the party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr Vic Toews, Minister of Justice (what irony) in the Harper cabinet, was the one who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that it was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has had an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one who has not taken home the countryman who was caught in the Guantanamo concentration camp from all the countries concerned.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was a young man than the things that happened to him were being accused of.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, is breaking its word and letting a child soldier pass away under inhumane conditions.
The only one who gets down to a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that also closes its eyes to torture: it is little that they are interested in the fact that a young adult will certainly be mentally broken after so many years of suffering.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are now experiencing a insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper is constantly carrying like a flag in front of him, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and enlist a Canadian citizen, according to the good of a head of government, who is still only supported by the minority (may he be part of the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they can find their salvation at a party that is preaching virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has untold itself of what made up the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, is in this release, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In her edition of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-Director-General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
The latter confirms and follows an orwellian logic that the world's largest gold winning company sought a slander claim for six million against three authors and a small medium-less publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slander claims, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely ignored by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to hold a public debate, to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the trial ends, the authors and the editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual regime that makes the other side mundane and also detracts anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things in front of public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on in many of the countries in which Barrick is working gold, debates in Canada are usually held through the exchange of ideas and not by the bailiff.
It would therefore have been enough for the gold mine to have published its books and files and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, while at the same time disrespecting the opinions of the public at the same time?
It seems that this word in the vice-president's world only includes the generous lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slander have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does so mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is ready to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many consider to be a knebel suit (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she asks them not to use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth-finding that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of the world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to deal with debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she is not in a position to have a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this type of unjustified action.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and the senior congressmen, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 30's.
The new version of the plan for $700 billion to stop the financial crisis, which has been shackling Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two Congress chambers.
The main content is: better control of Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new orders to reduce the number of houses that have been kept due to payment delays, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior employees of the supported companies.
American financial secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber of Deputies, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective, 'said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street, 'said the democrat.
'This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily life of the Americans will be enormous, 'said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that would have had a renewed failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, were more likely to be in favour of the agreement, but not to fail to express their dissatisfaction at the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain orders to the agreement, especially those that should allow the owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of the senior employees of the state-funded companies.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is nothing to be congratulated for.
But these measures are necessary, 'he said on the American television channels.
When he was asked on another station to vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
"The principles I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, 'he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of the high-risk mortgage credit (subprime) before it extended to further forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally led to a freezing of financial power and to the ruin of banks and money institutions.
It was a group of Republican Members who failed the first attempt to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the societies in distress are to be secured only by the government and not bought, the dead end is believed to be escape.
In order to close the point of view for all in Congress, an order has also been added, which states that if the government should make losses with this programme within five years, it can then raise new taxes in order to recover its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which a further 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be passed by the Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington will receive shares in the supported companies that will pay him dividends in the case of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will be able to stop the deposit procedures for the housing linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan and also to set time limits for the repayment and severance payments paid to the management employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were further votes against this proposal, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Obviously, Washington does not understand us, 'said the Republican Scott Garet, member of the Board's Financial Commission, to his voters.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one who is asking the taxpayers to pay for it. '
The democratic Member of Parliament, Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucasus of the Skeptics', is different, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to be put under pressure and to carefully consider the way forward, 'he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe have once again been given proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its bankruptcy, which is in great difficulty since it lost EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said the Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In order to compensate for this, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households value, now that unsafe times are announced. '
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank that was under pressure from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure-blue eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and an obvious talent have also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly terrible monster.
But what a big long-term runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for a long time he was a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, and certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the blasting of dramaturgic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
Its European roots should be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the extreme quality feature.
For in him, a whole country, which was in love with the self-made man, was reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War in the battle, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 50's and then went to the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theatre, on television and soon also in the cinema.
It was this man who fought for civil rights that was also the driver who was in 1979 at the 24-hour race of Man's second, and also a sex symbol, even though he lived with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a show relationship.
With it also the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and sensitive star, which will never be completely solved, will disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman moved the movie lovers this weekend to Taumel, while on the dark screen of memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing by with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) again comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to The Cat on the hot tin roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter recollection (1990) is raised, which is to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfil all of her promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Like Me (A Hand full of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, who was rerecorded after his death and who made Newman well known in 1956.
This pleasant ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vindictive billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was him.
Still him.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as the father of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle was closed.
In contrast to several movie legends, who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, and Hollywood, his assets, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he judged his too expressive performance.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles for a long time only flew so easily.
However, he played Sunnyboys less often as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fists or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his disgust and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His wife Joanne Woodward, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) in the lead role, drew a fine-minded female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
At the flood of honours that came over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former arms mate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: "His presence has improved my life and this country."
generosity and joy of life were essential features of the late actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the drift of Hollywood, is now going there.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other food, and thought this was rather tasteless, even though we found it still funny at first.
The profits from his sales were still in his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman was committed to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Always and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
A good-for-all citizen, in the narrowest and the broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Behl & amp; Co.?
On October 8, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János's supplement and his accomplices will begin.
In particular, the defendants are accused of participation in organised crime, as well as of gross negligence and commercial fraud, and of other criminal acts, including the falsification of documents.
According to the public prosecutor, the funds lucrated from the calls for proposals were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often provided with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and self-government grants - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be found in the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, and in the private funds of individuals.
As the investigation authorities have announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received and the associations should not have complied with their obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills have been falsified.
The accounting blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the bills are to be issued was decided on the tour north of Lake Balaton, on which István Lados was sent by János' supplement.
In the course of this "exploration tour," Lado's guest houses and restaurants should be found.
He asked for a bill on the consumption to be issued later on, based on these templates, for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and for the self-government of Budapest.
The majority of these invoices are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András Zurri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports according to our information.
One of the goals of Lado's "Exploring" was a beer bar.
As two invoices issued by Biztos Pont Egyesület in 2003, the restaurant company is said to have hosted the nine-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együt a Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious forms and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonyomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was obviously not limited as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not appear at all.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas of the hvg.hu informed, he immediately knew that these were fake documents when he was provided with documents by the public prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were misplaced on the stamp."
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the company should have housed a hundred people was also wrong, after they have a total of 11 rooms, which are impossible to offer so many people space.
It was also mentioned on the bill that the restaurant had not been in operation for a long time.
The impugned accountants have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they are targeting only offers travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary's travel on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As is known in the course of the investigation, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfühöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the company charged only 15% of VAT instead of 25, and on the other hand only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made to the "accountants" was the fact that in a case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specialized in investment advice, the public prosecutor informed the public prosecutor.
Further formal errors - false accounting format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as forgeries.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors had told them never to have issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been made to the forgeries at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in the process of being dissolved at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that it did not issue the invoices itself.
Gently falsified
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they had to place fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued invoices for the Együt a Harmadik Évezredért, of about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also expected to have worked together with a supplement and a co.: In 2003, the GmbH is expected to have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the associations Atlas Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with fake invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which related to undelivered services.
However, there was also no payment transaction, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which the parties have forgotten to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of the Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest, but not found there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the total value of HUF for the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has been the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to which the company documents were also to be served by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov was able to issue invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the associations Atlas and Hoppá, as well as to Együt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent value itself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kf. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons on Iván Kubatov's express wish.
However, in fact, none of these companies was active, which, according to the accused, was due to a lack of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Scene, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued bills on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlas and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The public prosecutor assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the amount of the bill and the VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issue of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were placed in the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forint each, but used these amounts in a different way.
To cover this up, they have presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices of the Works Team Kf...
These bills were also provided in the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some of the defendants are now expected to have a confession of the way in which the bills are processed, as they have already been filed before the public prosecutor.
A sensation could be, if the main defendant János's supplement decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report on everything in detail on several occasions, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him on the reparation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether it is in return prepared to take responsibility.
It is, however, quite possible that Supplement will now play the "offended" after his requests for relief of the detention and house arrest had been met with deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage to economic crimes and who have not paid for them are at large, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is not allowed.
The Psychology of Overdoing - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus to overrate the price offered.
Neurologers and economic researchers at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lotto while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of striatum, a complex below the brain bark, was measured at the loss of the auction, in which the opponent's overbid played a significant role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by the avoidance of overaction of the striate.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have made additional research into the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should be involved against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their operations.
Another group was also promised 15 dollars in reward in case they were the winners of the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only that the emphasis was on winning, while the emphasis was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "against losing" group were prepared to take higher action than those in the control or "profit" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have, in fact, only justified the behaviour observed at auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding the risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation available "- said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed as the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and the diseases are different.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, for example, through the digestive tract (through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretion or saliva).
In any case, travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
Then the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from the much more severe diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected patients is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most of the infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen is deeply destroying the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular monitoring, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have undergone blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
The number of chronic hepatitis C patients in the world is currently estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated, which will prevent the risk of infection and prevent the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, held for the first time in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of these chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research shows, religious faith is a kind of "painkiller" that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: the extent to which faith in God influences the human feeling of pain, the British paper "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain-scan technology, it was even possible to prove that Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, also philosophers and theologians from different departments of the university participate.
In the experiment, a radiant device was connected to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin."
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would create a kind of religious trance, as they chose Vincent's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and was felt to be reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during that time, while looking at either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "in safety" at the sight of the Mother of God as if they were "worried," and that they felt "peace and quiet."
During the view of the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than when they had seen Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, said that one could also cause similar effects with other, strong-acting images also with the atheists, one only had to find the appropriate photo.
"We would have to find a picture that is very positive, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and does so in many cases," says Wright.
According to these excellent results, the only question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can say with all due respect: it is found in people's pockets as well as over their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go to and what moves them.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managing directors of Google.
In the direction of skeptics, which are plagued by Orwelle's horror visions, he has said: These would just overlook the essence of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main objective is to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the company's original objective, according to which they "want to order all the information in this world."
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?" but software programs are not yet able to do so, as they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be registered in the course of their Internet search, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search course and later to use it so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "recommendations," with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on the previous preferences.
However, users are wondering what happens in the event of data abuse - "When you look at what I do" - some people are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company, which acts as a source of fear, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or the desire for power against the power that many Internet users have to reject.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of a start, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
One example of this was the recent action against paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut," which also enabled the identification of paedophilia.
However, users who were concerned about personal rights could still breathe up in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully moved to court against the FBI: therefore, Google cannot be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with any point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the issue of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms by reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has been denied the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, retroactively to two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who do not like to issue their personal data because by using Google services they fear the loss of their private and intimate sphere, scourge the company with the indignation that is due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "Geek culture," which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, is the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, as opposed to Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users to have any identification codes, unlike Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks look through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been in the focus especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0."
In fact, the "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, in other words, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individual, the main thing remains the same, that is to show themselves publicly.
An average young person can manage his profile at the same time on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect them with each other through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and it can finally include all this in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are flocked on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove that when looking at the party photos of the last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend was having fun with, or the employee is being released because he is only too honest in his blog with his anger about the company's management - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
The one who leads an online life is what it reveals - in this way one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And those who try to keep something secret, or even to circumvent the Google monopoly, can do so - such as Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google's search engine, deliberately leaves no trace.
Not a few people deliberately register on community sites so they can't be found, but also Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be used with alternative versions that are not linked to a huge server park and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords / AdSense is threatening the revenues of the advertising agencies, and the more and more quickly introduced services are not only causing the head break, but also other software developers.
However, critical viewers also find the disconcerting counterpoles: for example, the Group's management has completely rejected a protest from the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten have been doubled, and the management said that the multiple food of the employees is too expensive, but all of this is very mild against the fact that in 2006 Google even went on its knees before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all the regime-critical hits, or those that are in breach of the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that in advance it is not a new service, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could be a lot of a change: while some of them think that Google's book and magazine and archiving project is now taking on a scale that the company would have to deal with the Supreme Court soon, others are rather concerned about the "health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the substance - for example, "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorov, describes in the best Orwellian manner a future in which a human being becomes frighteningly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd to eliminate the trace
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of having helped to remove the traces, the spokesman of the police department of Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were well-informed and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves at large.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having intentionally killed several people out of money.
In the course of the investigation it was found that the 23-year-old had owed a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor on a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the action of a long hand - this is also proof of the fact that he has committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The police, together with experts, are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange issues purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered a 100% purchase of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is fully owned by the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to news from the Czech daily newspaper "E15," the Polish offer includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner of all the interested parties, and he did not exclude that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to be 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European pages already spoke on Tuesday of "the second 11 September."
We owe the global financial disaster to the American President, for example, "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to get his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as the millionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September."
Some of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
In the view of the "El Mundo," the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the global economy is now on the brink of the collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, the risk is that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example the Geneva "day-ad."
While some states could still make available to their money institutions, which have been lost, rescue packages, and save the banks from bankruptcy with the taxpayers' money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are going to be broke, then neither further financial injections nor other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out of weak money institutions, the Vienna "The Standard." In addition, the newspaper continued, the concerns were more and more realistic that, after the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis that is now being swept over the old continents like a tsunami.
The "saviors" would not have to "waver" at once with several hundred billion euros, but it would be advisable to keep in mind in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, in which the Nissan engineers of Hummel were inspired in the creation of new accident of avoiding systems.
In cooperation with the Tokioter University, Nissan has built the BR23C-controlled biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area," which is very similar to our own "shield," Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can be seen in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled spacer.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to the board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in second parts, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tyres around the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctively taking place.
"If it were not, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they evade other bees.
And this has to be done in a fraction of a second.
However, as opposed to the bees, the evasive can not go up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the wendability of the tyres.
While the bees are here infinitely open to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotation, or the acceleration and braking of the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh said it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to save it.
This device must only process and react to some inputs per second.
It does not have to save it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous manoeuvres, so that it is constantly using only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan, will be in production in the next ten years as standard.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously steering the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is the written version of the $700 billion rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and is aimed at the purchase of the banks' bad loans.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, the Congressmen, after several days of debate, went through to an agreement on the $700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, President of the US House of Representatives, and said that the agreement had to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
As a result, Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said: "The programme will be effective and it will be efficient, but we must do more. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time on Sunday night 8: 00 (Central European time on Monday 2: 00 in the morning), but did not start a high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Deputies first votes on the draft law on the stabilisation of the economy of 2008, then it is the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
The programme, however, differs from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of lazy securities with loans.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion is to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday, which is to be spent on the purchase of credit-charged, bad securities, and the President is to decide on the further $100 billion.
The programme is being reviewed by a separate Commission, which is also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion will depend on a further decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can purchase at the same time bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-related securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be done both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying resources and the companies pay the appropriate fees for the damage to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid for the American financial system, be it for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now in need of state aid can expect the government to reduce their copies, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance is helping each other.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry is purchased at an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the bank head is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the managers' salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers' salaries are regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains the right to participate in the participating banks, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank are better.
The draft law provides that the President will have to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get back their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were sceptics on both sides that expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect the taxpayers' money, says the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: "The measures were taken by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1% higher than in July 2008, and have fallen by 3.9% compared to previous year's prices.
As a result of the price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Sales prices in the domestic market increased only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1%.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased only a little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly for bags and belts - the increase was 4.6 percent, and for shoes the prices were 2.5 percent high.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
A fall in prices was recorded for crude oil processing (1.4 percent), for electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and for wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other manufacturing sectors, the price increase was between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the major domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3% in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in the year on year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4%).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, drink and tobacco was 11%.
A fall in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5%) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3%).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry increased by 10.2 percent last year.
The prices of electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase in the capital goods sector was recorded in August (0.7%).
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3%, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained the same as in the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 percent) compared to the same period in 2007.
In the consumer goods sectors, a price increase of 6.8 per cent was noted, and in fixed goods a price reduction of 1.4 per cent was noted.
The export prices of the industry, measured in Forint, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared with the previous month, but there was a fall by 3.9 percent in the year.
The domestic currency became weaker by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, by 7.1 percent to the dollar, and compared to the August 2007 rate, it became stronger by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and by 15.9 percent to the dollar.
No longer a visa to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced in time overseas."
However, she also stressed that the new system will not be allowed to enter, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and she also talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, agreed on Sunday to support the $700 billion rescue package for banks, but there are also politicians who call for the Minister of Finance to resign.
The Congress and government representatives have announced, after day-to-day marathon discussions on Sunday morning, that they have reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted down at the same time.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, whole industries, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened" - he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete."
In an interview given to the station ABC, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time with this (...) but no work is certainly no alternative."
The Republican senator said that the plan also requires the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the clearance of top managers - something that he had insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-hand camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "The Mirror" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution is destroying its fathers."
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his duties.
The Christian social partners have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from it.
The break of the era is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is the case for Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU did not come as a surprise, but something came to an end on Sunday, but this was already quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party.
In 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7%, the first time since the 1950s to fall under the 50% mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in other words in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation of the CSU in the federal state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at a very high rate, but without effect, the secularization, the success of education, the return of East and North Germans to the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the fidelity of the CSU voters could not remain.
Modernisation is always accompanied by increased options, and this has political consequences.
The right-hand camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willing.
It is striking that over the last few weeks, the classical civil groups have been the most distant in the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial citizenship and the electorate with a degree in higher education.
In this case, CSU support decreased to even below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders reserved in coalition issues" article on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP is not allowed to interfere with the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the leaders of the parties were hardly able to see their cards.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann reiterated his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very well possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be possible.
Molterer has, however, reacted carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried to interfere with the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition or in the coalition is now completely open, and these issues should be discussed in-house.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take over government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which is held this year by the EU President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, France, has begun.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, drew attention in particular to the education sector, as it is one of the most serious legal violations that Roma children face, and this is the main obstacle to their application.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the Fidesz press office, Járóka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the job search, the Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have middle-school education and, thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can get a higher education degree."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education was a fundamental human right, which would have a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the opinion of the Members, it is important that these links become as broad a circle as possible - that is, the Roma and the non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increasing, and through income and turnover tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped" - said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member has said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of disintegration in the education sector, and it is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen," Járóka called for.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advance of the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities."
CSU: grace for time
End of October will be decided on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the election debacle, there are no heads at the time; at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates were postponed.
Head of the party Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17% loss of voice will be decided on the last weekend of October at the extraordinary party day.
The much-cut duo, however, already made it clear that it does not want to stick on its armchairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry group and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at his career center - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. But now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "single government" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
The Conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party-internal restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer is also involved in the investigation team, which is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voter" on a possible Munich coalition.
The irony of fate is that with the list of "Free Voters" the Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature, whose anti-stoiber appearance first took advantage of the Huber-Beckstein Duo, in order to then serve the target-seeking politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will have an active role to play. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called the 28 September "the most bitter day of his political career."
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments towards CDU - in his view, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed a great deal to the success of 2005 at national level, is not to be put back on its feet with a common force, Merkel cannot become a Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no sense of her disappointment at the Fiasko, believes that the CSU's land loss will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition made it to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that it is illegal to count the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
De Legislatur of the 10 million population state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposite party, which was set up under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections, has been seriously hoping that Lukashenko, who, in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, would allow his presidential mandate for the fourth time, this time some of the opposition members in Parliament. "
This is why the ODS has even taken a step away from the boycotts that were planned before.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent, thanks to the rising prices of gas imports from Russia, and even loans have been made to alleviate the price increases, and the country has also agreed to the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the context of the expectations of the opposition, the hope was that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-level politicians had a ban on entry in the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, which focused on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections, provided for a temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - so the opposition is not expected to be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
In spite of all this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free for example, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the renegade Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, has been considered independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
In the view of the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let only one opposition in Parliament."
The opposition does not plan to take protest measures in the light of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We are struggling with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of selling stones, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich in allusion to the fact that not even the most supported layer of the Pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the" social security "that is called for the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," said Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition political, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the actions, not the words." The lack of the opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrance and exit of the officials.
From today on, the measure will come into force against those smart people who first stamp and then go to coffee drinks during working hours.
The new "Anti-Faulfur Law" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">" Rotary doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services, "said Minister Brunetta.
"A new era of responsibility and transparency is now beginning.
This is reformism, "stresses Brunetta.
The Palazzo Chigi is the end of the establishment in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of the rotating doors is also of great symbolic value."
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General said: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no breakfast during the working time; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miracles."
During a meeting of the High Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister of Rome announces that "within three months the absence of officials has reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work."
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration.
"their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice the size of the private sector in the last 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for the Public Service is proliferating with figures on lower reductions in work - as the consumer centre writes - the people of 'active sloth' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil service officials have come together to explain the war to the contrary standards of the decree. "
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related disease, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy there are 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 remain in the life of the disabled.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli inforruni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as a result of murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in order to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data of Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial issue of prevention at the workplace," the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to job prevention, the protection of injured workers, the aid to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion."
"An outrageous" Basta "has risen to this; understandable in the case of tragedies that, as measured by their scale, trigger some vortex in the media and the public's participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events, which can even repeat itself in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is a resource problem in any case: it must be invested in education and information."
The many initiatives for a more direct awareness of the school framework on the part of young people who feed the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness. It is necessary to put in place and improve a legislative standard.
On the one hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths is an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all the institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem."
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," says President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this" positive trend "to mean less attention. That is what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you think that, in principle, you do too little to face the phenomenon of accidents, and you can fight it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary - according to Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting at school. "
"A further effort is necessary - he added - in terms of communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency. "
It was also a question of "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work" and of the "abolition of the social system we have been fighting over the last few years."
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under charge: risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a report published today in Brussels cites the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the EU's current and recently identified health risks).
"The report, as it says in a note, makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people who usually place portable music equipment and mobile phones on a high volume will damage their hearing without knowing it inextricably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"There is a clear risk from the scientific findings, as the European Union says, which is pressing for rapid action.
What really matters is to raise the awareness of consumers and make this information a common good.
In the light of this scientific knowledge, we must re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology. "
Brussels had entrusted the independent scientific committee with the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - as the EU Communication concludes - confirm that we are quite concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music and similar equipment."
There is already a European standard at the moment, which limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from too much noise.
One can very much limit these damage, in which one can reach solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the European Scientific Committee points out that, if the users of portable music equipment are only five hours a week (louder than 89 decibels) listen to music so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum sound level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this line of music risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This would mean 5-10% of the users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the European Union.
Roma, Alemanno gives the launch of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it will be over in March, and in June we will take stock.
This is the course set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome," and this morning the Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will be working on the management lines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the city council and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - Alemanno points out. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city council and the local council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will be dissolved, as such a project must have a time-determined end point.
In June - as the mayor says - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission. "
Those who call into question the Commission's competence, because their opinion of the Commission's lack of commitment, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it provides quality results - and this will certainly be the case in Rome - then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in mind, so that we can work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective. "
The Mayor of Rome has a lot of importance to make the following point: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think, it will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetically nor static in order to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future."
A future, said the Mayor of Rome, who "will not only be limited to the current local borders but will look much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. "
Obama - the first anti-American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much concerned with being considered independent, has written: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the United States and who maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and still does so today as a private man). "
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more violent, just now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!. "
However, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
In this case, too, there are people who speak to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the election cabin will we know who the real American patriot will give its voice to.
Here comes a US mentality, which was kept hidden to the last.
"Say what you want, and we will decide who we will make our cross for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before - only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists as well: In the newspapers you can already feel the cuts, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not really say that they were concerned about the general credibility of the information concerning the persons responsible.
You don't feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the major problems caused by the cuts in the newsroom, in other words the room in which the editors work to put the newspaper together.
It is a problem that needs to be solved - the interviewed journalists say - if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the great audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today is a reality for the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism at national level is on the wrong path.
In the local area, there are even 65% of the executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are on the way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they want to join the new technology in the hope "they bring something good for journalism."
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the editor-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety in work."
The managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
It is 30% for journalists.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "editors," An. d. Red.) is always a current topic in the US.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers offer as they like it and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often gets very high wages, while the editor can sometimes get only 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance money.
As far as holiday is concerned, it is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But, as they admit, American journalists often become "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: LAW IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA BLEICT IN GRATTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent's request, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is established against Coppola for bank red in the context of the anti-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl...
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence requirement in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentioni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to get the evidence he was accused of.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's 700 billion-dollar savings package: a large part of the Americans were and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the run-up to the Republican Party, which is becoming more and more divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favoured the state institutions and the business community and the neo-conservative, who is hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, and, inter alia, wins voters in the south and the centre of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example, which has just been mentioned, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing, or even already is,: not only in the US, even in the whole of the West and perhaps beyond, will be affected by it.
In both countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-awaited events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage a huge amount of the assets of households living in a single state.
This is a direct political problem for governments: how to behave with the families concerned, which is also an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis therefore appears to be global in economic terms, but politically it is almost purely national.
In this way, political internationalism seems to have lost its right to speak, and it is clear that the EU has provided evidence of this, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, is not able to find a common way.
Therefore, all now expect the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, among other things, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the US has been in a position to save itself without foreign aid.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two not to be overestimated conditions - under certain circumstances - to which otherwise no international organisation or market will be able to use them in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, perfectly in line with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated with a most closely related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now that we have been so convinced that we have long been in a united kingdom, in a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that we must suddenly see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other in the world, but are still very much connected with a narrow-cut piece of earth - a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another, who lives in a harvest-less, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short entry.
Who territory, who government, who says politics, thus also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for reputable lead ships, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaders, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, a picture of inexpedience, a sense of distance, all of which is directed at a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems that the belief among large parts of the population is the way to go, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as more and more foreign and superior.
The demand for leadership therefore feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of disarming the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in the unanticipated "revolts" of the voters and in the unmediated change of the collective state of mind of the past: beginning with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in the UK, towards the rebellion of the American deputies against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, its parties, its programmes, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say its format, more and more problems of understanding, and therefore less representative of what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West and is being further strengthened and driven by the financial crisis to overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be simply excessive to speak of a "rebellion of the masses."
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The superglue that goes up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a glue and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have almost reached the target.
With a glue applied on a surface of only 2.5 square cm, the researchers have succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO - an American magazine has published the results of the researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material created by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be seen as a set of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the gecko, which are covered by microscopic harnesses that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and grinding paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the reptiles' feet and at the same time "without any problems from the wall," said Lising Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Lising Dai.
For example, to go up on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers think more of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in the space sector.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER NATURE OF RESEARCH - also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present a microfibre adhesive that, like hair, cleanse itself from the dust by moving on a surface and thus always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in the summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin abundance, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the body's absorption.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed out the risk of packed as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with drug intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again made an alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus the health of the patients is at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines, such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENTE IN GEFAHR - The same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the risks of this mixture and stressed to pay attention to what is being drunk in combination with drugs such as diazepan or metadone.
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal by Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually passed on immediately to the various international producers who are so free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is appropriate to read the package leaflet at all times and, if there are any doubts, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or a doctor, "says the Ansa Agency's expert.
The Nobel Economic Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Economic Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in an editorial article of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the US than the attacks.
A prediction that received not a little polemics as a response and was held before the economist years later, but today proved to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style, which is particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package will be released
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software, as a free replacement for Microsoft's office, is gaining an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under freelance and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself with some new features to the audience: in addition to a revised and now Spartan-designed initial menu, a compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is finally achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, there was an interest in the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Some new features are also interesting, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, facilitates sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics processing modules and at the same time to keep the original appearance of the page.
This way, you can now also generate "hybrid" PDF files that extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed several times by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, a frame is assigned to each processor in order to guarantee a better correction process.
Some companies are in the process of publishing different functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html. It follows the English version, which has been on the mirors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if the free of charge can be an incentive for the dissemination of the program in private households, it is also in the business sector where OpenOffice could succeed in the big throw: after all, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which is an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program, which aims at the displacement of Excel; Impress, for the creation of presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase for the operation of databases instead of the more known access; and last draw, a graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads - a target that can be easily exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Also a positive test of cabbage and thus the fourth doping case
There is a new doping case in the framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-ranked and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver who was tested positive for Cera, the third-generation epo. Previously, this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the countersamples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest and, according to the Associated Press, also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber.
THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: Is ITALY RASISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of the emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants," which are only accepted with reluctance.
Do this from the Belpaese make a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy and about the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago, who had stolen a package of cookies from Burkina Faso.
The case testifies to what the Times call "the paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "the most integration and job opportunities exist" and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is recorded."
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times is based on further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation on immigration introduced by the Lega and on the rapid expulsion of illegal immigrants is also mentioned as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also stressed: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting in the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Student victims of up to 900 Euro per room high rental prices
The housing market for students knows no crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits. In fact, whole groups of students lose their right to study, because their families are unable to support them at this level" - said the Sunia, Laura Mariani - "in these cities, the high demand from the students leads to a deformalisation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of non-compliance: free contracts, missing registrations, without a rental price limit, illegal underrent.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which result in lower rental prices through a revision of the tax.
With a closer look at the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping area in the Brianza district is required about 450 Euro; a single room starts at 650 Euro (in the Nere district) and ends at 800 Euro in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district, or even 900 Euro in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping area costs an average of 350 / 400 Euro, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students are concentrated in the districts around the university, 250 / 280 euros are for a sleeping area of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double room.
The rent in the districts around the other universities of Rome is only a little lower: 550 Euro in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who move to outside areas can save money: 300 Euro for a place to sleep and 450 Euro for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 Euro for a sleeping area, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 Euro in the most expensive areas, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bed is 250-350 Euro, a single room at least 350 Euro.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% higher than the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso - the cities close their historical cinema
The historical cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplex cinema.
"A city without cinema channels is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the great urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multiroom complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only appears to be invincible and irrevocable, but also bears the features of a cultural crime.
The most affected are historical places full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with whom one has covered a piece of street full of emotions," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso," who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a world of cinema that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the vast number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these collieries paid most of the cinemas in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
One of the most affected regions is the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprit is the multiplex cinema, because it is these three regions in which the largest number of modern cinemas has been registered: at 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy has been leading the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but the first is the preservation of the already existing one, because a hall in the city closes, not all of its regular customers are ready to visit a multiplexkino in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the lack of budget for the fund of the Trade Union: the government's debt burden is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros in the year would be necessary. "
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinema, has decided to protect it through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, is the first such agreement in Italy to protect and support traditional cinema, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax concessions for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to go to the traffic limited areas of the centre and also to park at more favourable parking charges.
"It is a pleasant initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
But of course we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to do something about the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Bagiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that made me start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso," even though I had played with the idea for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The charges of the Prosecutor of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for being involved in mafia business, are serious.
In handcuffs, Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for being involved in criminal associations of the Mafia, at that time to a compensation of 10 million euros.
"Any kind of moral and legal standard disrespect," the lawyers say, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advisory activities."
"The Mafia force was thus made possible - according to the judges - to enter the city hall on an official way and to co-determine the policy of public administration."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest. "
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, which, according to the police, was beheaded by the Clan Piromalli.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 - and at that time also because of the alleged links between organised crime and local administration - the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then Mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Mitterechtskoalition in May 2006.
He cried out scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He went to the Vice-Minister, Marco Minniti, who he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but in connection with this morning's arrest warrant, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change of the A3 project.
In the case of the Dal Torrione case, it has been shown that there is a willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli - thus making public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan. "
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a non-sealed source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now does it seem to the world's major energy companies understand.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and are also looking to occult, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not happened to have significantly intensified since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of sea energy was taken off, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides would be added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company that now relies on sea energy is Enersis, which in 2005 signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this message was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy sector that rely on marine energy production.
"Chevron is studying these technologies," says the spokesperson of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the opportunity to work with us. "
It is about the acquisition of an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, especially given that, especially in Alaska, oil is still being promoted by the US and President Bush has recently set in motion the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, who invest in the new industry; even if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still under way, not least because the last doubts have not yet been resolved by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland have a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce large-scale energy, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected bojets.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure in the swimmers via piston and cylinder.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The current is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plants of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval, and some of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, is already producing energy for a store and a parking lot using under-sea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotation.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorization to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Profit Research, a particular interest is now worth the potential that is in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, the solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
