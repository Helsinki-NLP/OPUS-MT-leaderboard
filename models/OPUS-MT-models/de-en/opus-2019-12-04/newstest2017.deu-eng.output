28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "At last he was up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, informed the medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the LMO station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job as a cook in the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman of the Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first lived in Hostels, but that "things went up for him at last."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something for us, prepare dinner for us, "said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam with the current.
"With everything that went wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that was bright every day," he said.
Any person who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD's reference phone under the number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made this clear in an interview now.
"I am always put in drawers or get labels from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not wish to be always perfect and successful."
"To be honest, these things are more like me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with a loose dutt and Mexican food, it is said in the magazine.
She asked the question of the children's wish: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," said the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play," Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film is going on from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their time off, and they were hunting home in a fast gallop to the feed rags.
A kilometer at this rate, I was scared.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And with that the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses.
He and his family were led over the ALRV, and on a horse he did not even move for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid provided the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel, Champions Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British queen has already made him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master's winner was inducted into the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and the posthumous handball Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates are divided on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.
He would have a massive reduction in regulation, and he would be strong in favour of a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has the opportunity to open up disadvantaged people and it needs money for them.
That is why the taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that they need to be invested in.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are, for example, strongly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.
So, Trump could still be subject to internal party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump is planning to build coal-fired power plants and re-launch coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in protected areas, and the Paris Climate Change Agreement should be terminated.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to increase the renewable energies with her investment programme and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in the area of infrastructure, but also in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the Transacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They are to be paid better, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 was a hunger wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says that it must not be changed.
But the big discussion over the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics say that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every fleeing woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who's a year old at the most.
One of them put her little son in her arm.
He looks curious in the room with big eyes.
His mother's staring at the table.
Until she finds out she's being watched.
She smiles for a second and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the head of the department of Condrobs, a social aid company in Bavaria, and is concerned, among other things, with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It has been officially opened a long time ago.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard at the door.
"It is not too much to say: every woman who arrives here has had experience of sexual violence in her escape," says Bahr.
"Men are fleeing for wars because they are being persecuted politically, because they are under threat of torture or death, or because their families are sending them to Europe as a source of hope," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape predominate: "Many are secretly stealing from it because they see no other way out."
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsion, honorary killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them away.
On the run, that goes on.
"The fact that tugs, for example, demand a sexual action for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany, the end is crazy, Bahr tells.
Here, too, single women in refugee accommodation would often be considered inferior and at worst abused.
This means that about 90% of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been born voluntarily."
Many women are used to it so that they don't say anything.
"Or they do not dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."
As they often did not know how to help, more accommodation is needed only for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.
The question whether they knew about a project similar to that in Munich in their field of competence is answered by some with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in swabia, women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press officer.
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, in some community accommodation there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important for men and women to be home separately."
"If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can be - and continues to be - a reality."
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, as stated in the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen from the urge that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since we've been talking about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistants strike: demands for new work-related measures
The members of the interviewees have called on their trade union to approve new work-force measures in their disputes concerning a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work-force measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistants and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members, published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have been "persistently quiet" to problems, which led to the Treaty being rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour-fighting measures beginning in early September.
The disputes led to the first total failure in the history of the NHS, six times, this year.
The head of the BMA intern Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract was and should be beneficial.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.
Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow-lipped and he didn't radiate much heat, even for his reserved conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to be rather the opposite.
But a sustainable cool, radiating by Putin, showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launch of a Russian fighter on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was a very intense one.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen in Russia's back.
The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the veto will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media have carried out a violent, full attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious allegations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting only took place because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to make some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.
Erdogan needs, first and foremost, all the friends he can get after he was removed from office last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have taken Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it as follows: "Tourists there, tomatoes this way."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it considers its response to the attempted take-over of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the continuing grudge about the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for asking for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is, of course, a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of changing regimes.
The summit in this magnificent palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described to me, a "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel dismayed from the West and ill-treated and now join forces.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peace-maker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even fought the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator for Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian war jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is only to be reduced to a backoffice role, according to the head of the bank's board.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been dissociating since when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, "RBS" used brand rates to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we do not pursue global objectives, but local ones.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the different brands in its sport sponsorship.
"It is time for us to become a bank of the brands, because how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers (we have asked)?" said the head of the board.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3.000th profit at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3.000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He is followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the cheering when he takes the victory at Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best modern jockey and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic about this sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and a big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was annoying.
A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glory Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an aircraft crash and was banned from drugs.
Three years ago, he was in trouble at the beginning when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin's closest trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a Kremlin statement, Putin "ordered the release of Ivanov from his duties as president of the Russian presidential administration without any reason."
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later head of the minutes and staff of the government staff.
He said to Putin about his appointment, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state on draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidents of Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would resign at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president would like to lead Russian environmental policy at once - was very sceptical.
In his comments to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - for four years.
As it turns out, I have been President of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He was the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation last month in the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
There were artistic differences and differences on the set.
I regret the incident, "he said in a message.
Details of how the character of Gibson is published from the series following a team of FBI agents are expected to be published at a later date, according to the comments of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the first season of 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart blood in the last 12 years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that's not gonna be possible anymore.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the 12th season is scheduled for September 28.
The riddles of fish that landed in the garden in Banff
One of the inhabitants of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandaale spun by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "ceiling blower," which are approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 cutting parts.
The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck is now in Rosyth with a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or the country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern supply bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
As the tolerances the team was working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Luck to be alive"
Three men have "to be lucky still alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit the alarm at 13: 20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength.
"We saw the boat turn around and imagine the worst," said the head of the Moelfre Vince Jones rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we let it go to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency line, but it disintegrated from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was capturing the boat.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Slight hurt - man stings on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic offender cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When this came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body.
The police have been able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man's ex-boyfriend.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who is building Brunswick's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens think that investors will be much more obliged in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "housing policy" for the next Council meeting.
But the argument is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, the big point in the city hall is, according to Bratmann, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such land, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as possible as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market is growing.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.
But the program is not yet complete: because the around 1260 new apartments, they should be built anyway.
But how does one compensate for the loss of other around 1300 cheap apartments, whose support will end in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back into the price line.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved in one shot.
In the West City, time limits are running out at the end of the year.
Some 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners do not want this, the housing companies do not want it.
Because if the number of social housing in the West City is increased again dramatically, one is removed from the objective of the so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of the social weak in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect there to be some movement in the discussion.
Group President Holger Herlichke said: "For a large majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
It had concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.
But it does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
I am of course referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of cartoons, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased somewhat at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."
A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in the number of steps the "average" person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracked 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the game's launch, the number of followed people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want people to "take 30 minutes," "get off the sofa" and "be active every day" were on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy gamblers who always have to complain about something.
And, yeah, someone could run against a door.
What the hell?
A breakthrough has taken place.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity in the past, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will decline over time.
However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the real world's activity, helping many people to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Bines creates gold in the ladies' gymnast
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Bines is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Mühelos on the bar.
Stunning on the floor.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, at last, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
The total result of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles is on the bar during the single multi-campaign women in the art gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-campaign title and the fifth, as she strengthens her reputation of being the best of her generation, or even ever.
She broke into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment was over.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport over the last three years, won 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retson said she was "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Bes and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.
The American women Simone Bines, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-campaign of women in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles received the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as an exclamation mark.
Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey to the top, that's not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - are adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman was training, became the force.
She has not lost a multi-fight competition since the summer of 2013, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was deceptive.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
She again picked up with 15,433 on the bar - and put another one on the floor with a 15,933.
Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her final gift - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Bile's shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
The performance of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a depth went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Granny" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground practice, she threw her hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
With regard to Biles, the fast-growing tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot in the car listening to music
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl have been shot, who have been killed in one of the most deadly attacks in the first series murder case of Phoenix for a decade, while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fleeing with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed in nine attacks, and two others were injured, mainly in Hizpanian residential areas within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found shell sleeves and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the few of his elderly, Edmund has microcephalia, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved.
What's not right at all -- of course you got involved, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund may never know her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest to institutionalize it.
"My first answer to that was' I didn't know that people were still doing it '," said Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until his third year of age and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress.
He can run with support and ride a bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the drawing language Edmund made up for "Please sing something before me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the cikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts may vary a lot.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I always asked, what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. More rains are expected throughout Saturday.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rains, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the communities concerned is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that the community of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as they will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas via the river.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams were still using the flood water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose over night.
He said that another stepson, who lives nearby, would have warned him.
"We woke up and the water was flowing and flowing in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family had all the disabilities and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that all three of them would have been saved in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they had been accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "spread" quickly, as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities would consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the ground has been considerably full of rain since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rain and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed up by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuates.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond in the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the inhabitants to take away, who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city council.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses are said to have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but no houses have been reported on Friday so far.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Killed by bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy in Philadelphia was shot, this week the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents said that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and belly, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He has been through a lot, his small body had been erased by bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men of the offenders could be among them.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had been a cross fire between several shooters.
Patron shells for storm rifles that were traced back to various storm rifles were sewn over the scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuous fight.
On the road, on both sides of the road, there were pods.
There seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved, "police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the police in Philadelphia.
There were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police have been reported to review the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-party on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the gymnasium and for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Bines, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who seemed to be inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Bines, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymasticoutines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this kind of sport, but this is not the case in the whole country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same way as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and that gymnastics are primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents for the training, setting, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnastics and families). The list can be continued as much as possible.
The majority of these clubs are in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, a trainer of Simone Bines, and Maggie Haney, a coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started their gymnastics.
We must allow the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more efficient and accessible training.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnasium.
At my events we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Teams develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.
It's so important to take part in the sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you for giving her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 internees who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS was in a "no-man's land" and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve the care at non-scheduled times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistants, said last night in a communication: "Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current labour crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new Treaty, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes through talks were based on the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes on the deafening silence.
This was the one of a promise made by Jeremy Hunt only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the compulsion and address the concerns of the intern."
If he does not, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-related measures.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide cover for doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, asked the intern to stop the strike.
Mortimer said, "There is nothing to do with the work-campaign, but it is a burden on already overloaded teams and service providers, and it is only a concern, distress and interruption for patients, carers and their families."
In the last two months we have spoken to the Committee of Assistants and have responded positively to the concerns about the guardians and the Whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career, the most training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after the authorities have recommended to give this more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat-containing material in the arterial walls that make up coverings.
When the surface breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft instructions of NICE, published today, recommend a 12-month dose of 90mg ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a new heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding, is limited to a period of up to three years.
Political Correctness culture makes election fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to the knowingly ignored widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is verbally attacking the police, election observers and city hall for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "hymns regarding ethnicity and religion."
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barricades outside of election cabins to protect imprisoned voters.
He recommended that voters carry an ID to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, only a voter has to give his name and address.
The report proposes to put non-removable ink on a person's finger when they make their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only against election fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that is associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the reigning mayor Lutfur Rahman was to be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racial and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the relentless duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of a imitation in which one person is chosen as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud in the whole country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - where older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including holding ID cards to prove the identity
The report states: "It is appropriate to demonstrate that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with a Pakistani or a Bangladic background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour because of" politically correct "hymns about the ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists working on letter-to-vote documents to stop "electoral harvesting."
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires harder registration checks to prevent the list of elections being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
consider options to ask voters before the election for your ID.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic letter selection.
Prohibition of political activists working on full mail elections and envelopes of mail elections.
Give the police the power to set up a lockdown for election stations.
A change of law that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
No photography in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal record was filed.
"The election court declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
He also criticised the uneffective "check-out" of the city hall's election registration departments.
Sir Eric said, "The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of the parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about Kates Radler-Doppelgänger and other famous doppelgänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio this week got out of the way about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive double-winger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic is by no means the only athlete to fight for gold, who has his own famous doppelganger - at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are now flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympic Games that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: Team member of the US team in the archery Brady Ellison, left, is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
In addition to Kate's double-player on the radar track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer of the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The US team member in the archery Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks very similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star showed up.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I myself do not see much resemblance, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus this year: the striking similarity between the British wide-jumping Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is supposed to be able to go through as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gear higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another lasting comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the suntan skin and blond hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to be a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas gymnast, who has her own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m Freistilspolstaffel outraged spectators of the CBC live transmission of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
The Canadian channel CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and during the race like "a pig died."
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he made his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m Freistilspolstaffel.
MacDonald, who had been taken to the CBS's commentator team to give more "color," one could say: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like a pusher, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to open the gap with China.
Audience across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "???
The idiot didn't understand they were still on the air. "
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free-lance game for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many raised him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wow, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast over a swimming performance."
It was an unhappily chosen formulation, we are sorry it happened. "
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to the people who answered the note on Twitter
Commentary college Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologized to our audience on the air and our followers in the social media.
To make one thing clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unwell-chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's pool meeting in the CBC Olympics, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry. "
Buyer in Primark is outraged by the woman who tries shameless underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try on underpants.
In order to make the situation worse, she muttered as she looked in it, took it out and put it back in the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried on four pair of underpants in a store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark business at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before she put them back in the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried on the underwear, "she turned on again and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discrete place to do it - she just stood there, naughty as Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took off her underpants, which she obviously did not like, as she put them back in the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, got back on and went out.
"She didn't seem to mind someone watching her - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that had another person on and who were not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson added: "As I have heard, the employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had her on and moved out and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9 in our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Regardless of whether you are being approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your robber.
If you're being approached from behind, you should turn around first so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with your knee in the groin and turn, while the attacker is in pain, the gun is in his hands. Hit him in the face with the run and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before moving backwards and pointing the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, it's the safest thing to hand over your money to a robbery, unless you're a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright shabbed his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller subjected his immune system and strangleflex to a serious test - by licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shabbed his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the flushing button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
During his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railroads at railway stations to cleaning buttons of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under one test
In the film he said, "As a child, I was relatively unworried about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he definitely did justice to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
In comparison, the number of luminometers of fresh washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This is coming close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company is providing Mr Wright with Valio Felius, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had lick some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film. "
In a 2015 survey carried out by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they used at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogation social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social housing after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls had rattling holes, wooden panels were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family have been moved and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I think that people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as a not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who in the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had added included street fights with baseball rackets, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs have been traded in the past, the wooden floors have been torn up.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police
Cornwall Housing, she and her partner, disagreed with the property this week, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The deogation was exulted by relieved neighbors who said that their life was made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforce Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have failed the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant had failed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, as a deloding is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be seen terribly for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have been courageously involved in our work and have provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and that the message is that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor
The workers of the house administration will now have to remove the waste mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had found guilty of possession of a class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being out of shelter, Tanya and her partner are expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's walls were covered with graffiti.
The police say she's gonna dislog tenants who don't follow the house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police reported that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This is for those who think that they can behave without self-reproach and for those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep-lying military jet overflies the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force put down an incredible fall flight
The Air Force reported it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when scared tourists start to panic after a deep-lying jet falls over a full beach.
Dramatic video shows how the military aircraft was flying almost in close proximity to the sun worshipers on the beach section of Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when, understandably, they began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was due to them through the clouds.
The incident happened last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said, "It really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The speaker said that the jet was flying a little deeper than usual due to the poor visual conditions of the nearby area fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at any time at all.
This summer, land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, which also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worry about Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the duel around the Spanish supercup outside against the FC Sevilla, the back-up is up three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must, at the level of the forces, renounce Neymar with the inferior Cupfinalist and ruling Europe League champion, among other things, who is competing with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is missing.
The German experienced a band dusting in the knee in the training, so that the one-question at Barca is at least for the time being settled in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for the number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique so far waived a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool at 0: 4.
Even at the 3: 2 in the trial against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co did not really convince.
In turn, Seville has to digest the 2-3 defeat after an extension in the European supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana."
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with 11 successes so far.
Ma Long in a separate league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old in Rio de Janeiro defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-page final.
The world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and the Olympic Games.
= = References = = = = External links = =
As expected, the two Chinese made it into the final game and made the title out of each other.
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic staircase was former SVS-NÖ Legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the gallery and left their shooters alone in the fair competition.
"I played the matches to this point for my country."
"I play for myself in the final," Zhang had said accordingly.
After the match, gold and silver medallion winners with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that he set the speed on the record and left Zhang there only 13 points.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected ripping match did not develop.
However, there were still enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4: 1.
In his quarter-final, the White Russian had a rib injury against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, after which he was in medical treatment, had to "finally" be content with sheet.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38 / 2004) and Jörgen Persson (42 / 2008) had, by the way, become a similar high table tennis age Olympic fourth.
Donald Trump admits "huge problems" in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states, of losing their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the normally large-scale and self-confident multi-millionaire expressed some of the concerns, as correspondents reported.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump in front of evangelical Christians, whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
It was his fault that he had false reports of his candidacy, he re-recorded his well-known media tents.
Wobble the Republican strongholds
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey carried out by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his bankruptcy from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were the same.
Other institutions see Trump in the front, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview of the CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton again: "Just as I have done so far."
And after that: "This will either be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long holiday."
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If it was not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that was all right, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to the press reports, the Trump party is said to have threatened to remove funds to support its election campaign if it is not able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republican candidates for the Congress should be given greater support.
Olympia: Triple fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
After the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Kenia's athletics are in danger of being unarmed.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The World Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to carry out its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson announced.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," said an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenia's head of mission, Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become a fourth in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan Athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country's upcoming doping tests for money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
When the IOC announced more than 2000 target doping controls before the Rio Games, it was unusual to point out in advance that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose fight against doping is in line with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, there have been repeatedly allegations that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and that there is a significant mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in the Russian athletics.
It has been shown that in this type of sport it has been completely and systematically doped.

Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he warmed.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and funny and bright."
So she's smart, of course, naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
For him, conducting is a necessity.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It's such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley the "West Side Story" is up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puertoricans went to New York, and the New York people didn't want them.
These are the same issues, and they are now as meaningful as they were at the time.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, has been reported to have died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was assumed that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she intended to leave the war-stricken country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from East London entered a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultan's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will stay with Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court of Antonin Scala.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty."
A spokesperson from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the highest judge for the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the nomination of Garland, being Lakaien and helping the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was not suitable for the President's office.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and men"
The Treats magazine works with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find their NU Muses Calendar for 2017 the next generation of top models.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine was different from Oldpool playboys, because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
He seems to think that the calendar is doing the same.
"We must return to the presentation of timeless and classic nudity, in which both women and men feel at ease and are inspired by these pictures of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects in the short term tens of thousands of protection seekers who are fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand," believes the association president Ali Toprak.
Because of the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count on tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Association President Ali Toprak of the "world" on Friday.
Because the government had already overtaken Kurdish strongholds with impunity months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
After the thwarted coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself receives refugees produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevite cities.
With this, Erdogan wanted to increase the exiting pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association called for the Federal Government to "position itself as strongly as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."
There is also a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics in Germany.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially the Kurds and the opposition.
The fire-marking as a Gülen-trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemallists and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "World."
As the newspaper reports by reference to the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks set up the largest group of people who have been recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
As of June 30, these were 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those who were recognised as entitled to asylum (39.625).
This survey does not include those who have fled from war, poverty or lack of perspective.
Under the Basic Law, asylum rights are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the country's election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it is not possible to do more stupid than before: summer holidays, heat and country election - that is what bites.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters, are on holiday.
Most of the holidaymakers who are in the country on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting votes, are only hard to find.
By September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to have an election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can even say that, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selling, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end of the coalition fit.
Selling, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, has been doing an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one does not think of his large-scale posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks to the people a little, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and is blaming Chancellor Merkel for the afD's blossom.
Her refugee policy, her "we can do it," has accelerated the rise of the right-wing lists, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to do a campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale recollections; Merkel Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently complained in the NDR.
But it is also a pity not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely renounces the usual campaign stands in market places and in front of shopping centres with parasols and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role."
The Union, too, has noticed that you are rushing away the base in the country, that it must make a great effort to find a connection with people again.
It is like the left, the SPD, the green: in the far of the country there is hardly any.
The CDU election fighter Kokert's advice to his fellow leaders is, however, self-revealing: "They must go where it hurts, that is, where people are: the village's most, the golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because there is a lot at stake, Selling has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats last had 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had won a clear 35.6 percent win in front of the CDU (22).
The Greens, the small party with seven percent in the surveys, are expected to make the jump into the country's day.
They make the need for a holiday a modern virtue and place their campaign on the Internet for the most part.
"Online campaign," it is called the state president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election fighters go on track search for local voting citizens among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curvating through the Mecklenburg Lakes with a houseboat and is still beautiful.
Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27-Redevelopment: restaurants suffer from blocking
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.
For those responsible for the construction works, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end at 8.00 in the morning, there is a lot of praise.
"They made it all pretty zaggy," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet gas station.
This is a superteam.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
The meeting of those responsible for the construction work is also being praised, for example, when it comes to the establishment of accommodation facilities.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the barrier of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and the connection to Rottenburg again, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
The citizens can now move from Ofterdingen to the B 27 again on both sides.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to be going back.
"There have been some significant complaints," says the deputy head of the office, Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation.
The residents of Bachzetzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of them were looking for narrow paths and trusted their Navi rather than the signs.
Which led to some trucks being fused in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality more and more requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been considerable overlaps," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was in the speed 30 zone with 77 km.
Since the construction site moved on, it has become more calm.
For the business people on the B 27 it is only a small comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
You don't like to look at the cards, do you?
But the fact that the B 27 redevelopment has led to a fall in their sales, makes everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", that is to say, produced for other companies, have little impact on them.
Even at the Maier car house Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum slight decrease," but also admits that of course "the running audience is missing."
The most vulnerable are the villages along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words.
This is already life-threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard."
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
He estimated the sales loss at "well over 50 percent."
The road renovation had "thrown back" its operation by two years.
He had to release half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt replied to a question from Göhner on whether there could be a financial compensation, saying that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages of the rehabilitation.
Göhner knows about other counties where such a thing was handled more generously.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, referring to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice elsewhere.
The fact that his regular clientele comes back after the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about that.
Despite the BSE and avian influenza crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on its customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being bolted.
After the recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a debt status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the mercenary.
All his proposals were "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package.
You're not extorting anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, he was, however, in favour of results and of a "viable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière had some time passed before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But these are now all the more important.
Some things are already known, announced, hailed: The fact that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second call for proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish the sympathies advertising for terrorist groups and to take off the German passport with double citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still considers this reasonable and does not ask for anything that the coalition partner does not have any chance at all.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have it in part: he plans fast procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before the deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
He wants to make some worse in the case of complaints for rejected asylum seekers than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to hide their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some of the things still seem unexplained and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, in the case of the unequal treatment of the patient - the question is: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in the face of the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be excluded even in election times.
Internal security has become an enormous focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns to be held.
The Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly involved in the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties have been high.
First a horrendous dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then a security-policy idea-collection of some union interior ministers, in which the department leaders also call for a Burka ban and a departure from double citizenship.
De Maizière is also working here to make a sound of reconciliation.
He doesn't think he's gonna turn away from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
I don't think it makes sense to reopen it.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show up.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to prosper on the issue of internal security.
The head of the party, Sigmar Gabriel, is a careful signal of willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen's still getting through.
Despite diesel scandals, the number of deliveries is increasing worldwide.
But it is not going around in all markets.
In the recall, there is a vortex for a term.
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year in the case of the deliveries of the last few months.
Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to show an increase in the course of the year, despite the diesel companies, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the VW core brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again loaded the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
The VW brand worldwide sold 1.8 percent less vehicles with 449100 cars in July than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China's second most important market, sales were 14 percent lower than in the previous month.
In the home market in Germany, the deliveries were almost one-sixth.
Trademark sales leader Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July to two days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there was a "change in the economic environment 'of the market.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, a speaker said that the British vote had also been a burden on them to leave the EU.
In the United States, where the exhaust gases first escalated, there is also a minus to the beech.
The major support for VW is the Chinese market.
In all, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is still glittering through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery reduction of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is possible.
Group sales leader Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales rate from January to July.
During this time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, with 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to be upgraded to the workshops.
In the course of the retrofitting, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer will issue a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customers after the upgrade, but will not speak of a "guarantee" as it was said in business circles on Friday.
The reason for this was legal delusions.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for redesigned diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW shall fully comply with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that, in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion, there will be no deterioration and all type-approval relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen himself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in business circles.
With the broad term "warranty," Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come into a workshop with engine damage half a year after the upgrade - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of the customer, it was also important to avoid any other damage, which had nothing to do with the exhaust channel, being unsure about the possible guarantee arrangements, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee."
In the future, the Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will require rich savers to pay penalty rates - as the second institution in Germany.
On Thursday, head of bank Josef Paul said: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in current or day money accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers "do not have to be afraid to pay for their savings rate."
If banks store overnight money at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September on by private and corporate customers for deposits of more than EUR 100,000 on current or day-to-day accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
For some time now, he has been protecting EUR 40 million, which could be removed from one day to the other and which he cannot use.
"These are in my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't lay down 4000 euros for every million."
He is now passing on the costs according to the 'polluter pays' principle.
To just leave the cash in the Raiffeisenbank's vault would be far too dangerous: "I've already seen four robberies, I don't want the fifth one!" said the bank board.
Most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The cooperative association of Bavaria said: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course is a major cost for all banks."
To carry them alone is "not possible for the long term in business."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or credit transfers.
With penalty interest for deposits of up to three million euros, the Thuringia Volks- and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, the main managing director of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay comprehensive charges for deposits, and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that on Lake Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is a little more equipped with the wealth."
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if it keeps money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The cooperative association of Bavaria "is currently not known to any other banks that charge an extra charge for deposits from private customers," said Speaker Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go into negative vis-à-vis the private customer is very, very high."
The competition was tough and it threatened the emigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not be able to do this in the width.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lone middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment part to oversow it under the pseudonym Non-AlleUnsämenMännerMittelage with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the many-mentioned resurrection of records is not due to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are, in all probability, between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and stare wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something specific like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room out.
The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when he appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early' 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hop, people who have heard about the comeback and who see themselves being forced to buy their old records again.
From the discussions I have held, people have usually disposed of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.
That would explain the boom to the members of the record revision of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record business offers a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers started the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that raise happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector, and I think that is the case with a lot of people.
It's a simple way to be mentally involved.
"We are like their social workers!" an employee flashes from a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not heard it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I was blowing through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said," I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radio head record so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-like, less music-like.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience as I go in.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop, instead of experimental jazz, drips out of the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.
None of them look very lonely, but nagging psychic trauma is hard to find when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of the plates for sale.
She's more like a shop window bump than a big buy-in.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is... "it displaces with a in-love sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be patching the jeans hotpants, I'm watching a group of young teenage girls group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just purely decorative, some so far up that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "record art."
But given that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a group of people who have more time and money than others is also the one who spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning with the hustling of record shops on Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while avoiding the stare of a creepy, 30-year-old false moderator who does not rise above the shoulders of a middle-aged man.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebral animal - Video report
More scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is investigating sharks, says that the record was in a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused to take down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to take down 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, to offer hairdressing services or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which would be at risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also said that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who were in the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
The judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the low-rise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated on a community basis and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes and advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure "for these children would be a disaster, of which the last eight years are old."
On Friday, the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains fighting
In spite of his disappointing performance in the Olympic time-driving, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be let down.
"I keep my eye on the World Cup, stay confident and continue to fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"It's really hard for me to comment on yesterday's time-driving," said Martin.
He had to analyse in peace what the reasons had led to the debacle.
At the time-driving World Cup in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in recent times."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time World Champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday on the 54.5 km at the Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis professional wins and misses semi-finals

Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was able to carry out its impact only once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, there was still a chance to jump into the forward round of the medals Angelique Kerber (Kiel / No. 2).
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).

Group increases at start-up for live video game transmission
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is going on for the takeover, Microsoft did not tell us on Thursday.
With his offer, Beam only started in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to the players and face enemies and provide equipment.
The player's Activision Blizzard will launch a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The staff of the start-up, which has been based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, are moving to Microsoft's headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam's co-founder and boss Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, the acquisition should not change anything for the customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google's mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforce Trailer
Germany's razor has to adapt to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are to be particularly effective in the transfer of speed lights.
The futuristic enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accident centres where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or to be renovated with temporary speed limits, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly.
The Enforce Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as driving bans after time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
The trailer can be moved in a high-speed state, according to the manufacturer, with any car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measurement operation, so that the wheels in the armoured and by the way also fire-proof outer cover disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lightning from vandalism.
The trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also blinking with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 last year.
United Kingdom gets silver in the 7-time rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-time Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, reigning, line-running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one British will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one thing here.
This is going to hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began with a wonderful start and made the attacks of Gb go off for fun.
It felt like walking on buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.
With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A hefty tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua read a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reattack and there was still over a minute of play time... in the first half.
Vatato Ravouvou pressed through another weak tackling of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning to play.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant midplay of fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favour of the South Seas Sulans, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the gallery.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-top with another attempt in the last seconds.
The fiff sounded, the fijis hugged and GB kicked in the lawn with a devastating impact.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a short half-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Asian team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the trainer's cancer to the rudder victory
There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games and that will mean something.
From the first rudder to the last, 220 hard hieves that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were at the rudder, there were three votes in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was present when they rudged to the second Olympic in two in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, who laid such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th undefeated commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of tails, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to the whole.
Behind every gold in the rudder is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, it's spreading everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if in such circumstances this is the right term.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal artillery regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you goes to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped right now.
Helen called "stay in trial, stay in trial."
It's really important not to be carried along.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backhall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better, "she said.
A good example of clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered to be "Bavarian-wide exemplary."
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago it was said in the original album in a contribution of the Bavarian radio.
A few years later, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken appreciated the special purpose association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was considered "Bavarian as exemplary."
Rupert Göller, who was a 31-year-old employee in the special purpose association, is behind all of this, of which 28 years as Managing Director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water group of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current president, the mayor of Breitbrunns, Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water waiter in 1985 and was already appointed as the managing director of the special purpose association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they have spread from water management and maintenance to office and organisation activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events, it called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the new wells (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high-rise tanks (1999), the new creation of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renovation of water lines.
There had been no standstill and there had been always new developments, because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudatio, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.
He was working with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he really lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He had received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best of water, and he was a faithful squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
In his view, he described the well-being and the restructuring of the special purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the tubing at the high-level container at Kirchlauter on a January 3.
Here at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who is following Rupert Göller.
The soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera."
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, had come well forward and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang to the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
The relationship state in Bargteheide - man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) on Friday at 10.45 am and killed her.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his partner," said a police spokesperson.
The culprit was on the run, and he was prosecuted in public.
In the meantime, Sven S. could be on the way by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a bald.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
By now, the man is bald.
I don't want the man to be directly addressed.
He could still carry the gun with him, the police said.
If you see Sven S., call 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship state."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck first did not want to provide information on the outcome of the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but it confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder offence."
"That's all we're saying right now," said a police spokesperson in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special mission (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-filled and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions.
The financial burden that the industry threatened to face in the field of eco-electricity production is off the table.
It remains in the case of the exemption from the renewable energy levy on the stock facilities for the so-called self-production of electricity in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that we have finally achieved this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of between EUR 120 and 240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works will an EEG levy of 20 percent be incurred.
However, this would not be collected in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on self-electricity production.
In this way, the status quo of the previous scheme is largely defined.
The success of Gabriel's efforts for the steel industry was particularly important.
"With regard to our 'steel is future' campaign, this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment objectives must also be weighed in the reform of the emissions trading," said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to deteriorate when the world's largest producer country, China, threw massive steel on the world market in the face of the weak domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have had an effect, and on the other, the economic prospects in China have been brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Finally, the prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
In the end, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.
In the German steel industry, some 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel producers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced about six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Stahl Economic Association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than in the previous year.
The association expects an increasing output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
community, mind, health: singing does seniors good
The singing has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching office she was in the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.
By the way, she does a good thing for her health and her spirit.
For Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music with the like-minded, describes Hackler.
By being together regularly, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also been made by Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To discuss and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together."
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the bust so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.
For the elderly, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of the senior organisations.
In the older generations, the common singing was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in the elderly is a source of many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementified people are taken into account in long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required to have a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, to focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially the elderly, who live alone, practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get through singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are enough good reasons to start singing.
Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if they think they have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes by?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the group of acquaintances is singing in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the church or the church head.
Many senior chors can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the Internet search.
If you want to sing, you should join a choir, advice Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cats to the cries of the young
In Hannover, biologists have studied the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the mowers did not let the males cold - but they always behaved the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can see the agitation of cat babies on the mew of the little ones.
They respond ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who feel in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Kater also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"It seems that the acoustic differences between the mew of less and strongly agitated young animals are either inperceptible or not of importance to the males," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first student of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams are different with the urgency of their need for assistance.
A total of nine adult kats and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
They were played for the first time by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded in a differentiated way to the cries," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call was played by the very more mature kitten.
This ability may be inborn or develop with the sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males even reacted," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise on a number of occasions in humans.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt an important football game is held in Turkey again.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the overthrow in July, the government said that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
It is not stopped before the football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
As a result, the suture now living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sukür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, in fact it has almost no effect on the life of most Turks.
The night "democratic guards" in public places throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas are not traditionally among the friends of the president.
But what unites the great of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besictas.
The cup winner "Gala" will be particularly interested in Lukas Podolski.
The Kölner demonstrated his sporting value in the past season: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first season as the top scorer of his club.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best on the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record master found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also left early in the Europa League.
= = References = = = = External links = =
The season was not good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"We have done this and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.
The year was better for Master Besiktas.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 season hits as the South Lig goalkeeper, laid the basis for the 14th title.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, who had been under contract with the AC Florence and only borrowed to Besictas, had announced after the coup attempt that the political situation in the country had not returned after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said the magazine "Kicker" Clubhead Fikret Orman.
To this end, however, the striker should be prepared to give up about a third of his annual salesman, estimated at EUR 7.5 million, said Orman, "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have a medal chance at the Olympic Games in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already closed twice because of doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanova must not start in Rio.
Other Athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The theme of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who, after a doping ban, had taken her right to start the games, was gracefully shoved out and rested out at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a curious scene: with an on-the-spot smile, she had still stumbled into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was found that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke into a cheering storm.
But there are many other athletes who, despite the doping past, are starting at the Rio Olympic Games.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-season / USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in the athletics.
He was already closed twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic winner and former world champion has been running even faster than before, and is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-season / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month lock in 2010, after having been shown to take the pain agent Oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic winner from 2012, the World Champion from 2013 and the European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively for the prohibited stimulant mean methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the knowledge and was closed for six months.
The four widest litters this year go to the account of the great gold favoritin.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-season / USA): The Beijing Olympic and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and closed for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, besieged Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerschlag, Belarus): I don't think so many medals have been withdrawn from one athlete.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later, after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse.
He also won the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games, following a judgment of the International Sports Court (CAS).

Liu Hong (20 km to go, China): The world record-keeping and gold favoritin was only tested positively in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of the use of a forbidden food supplement, the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was closed down in a mild manner and already ran off on July 13.
Bomb crisis in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll, on Friday morning.
She had had had cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She planned her trip home for early September.
The fact that the other explosions on the island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this respect, says Schnöll.
In the Hua Hin, located about 200 km south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs had first exploded on Thursday night in an outbound area.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more sets of explosives went up, and another person was killed according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
During the detonation near the beach beach of Patong, which is popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to the police.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive was blown up in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, the detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several injuries.
It was said to be a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee on Friday in front of journalists.
"We assume this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to comment on possible motives - but it was probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
In the attacks, Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
It is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past few days, the authorities had received secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and the places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police have instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement areas.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are not usually directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by the King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage strongly recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (level 3) was applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After disputes between security forces and Muslim parts of the population, it is not recommended to travel to these provinces without necessary travel.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence over the years to come.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which had taken power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, has taken advantage of the Kingdom's return to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to control the uprising of Muslim rebels that has been raging in the far south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
In addition, almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack in the country's recent history.
The right "identity movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identity Movement' indications of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said Head of the Constitutional Protection Office Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are defamated in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement.
The "Idental Movement" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multi-culti-delusion," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's identity through overalienation."
The "identities" are already being observed in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia.
Maaßen said that his authority had been in close contact with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identity movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of the constitutional protection.
In general, extremists try to speak to them with a youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
This is what Islamists would do, as well as right-wing extremists.
It's not a nice commercial for one's own business.
The propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
It's dangerous.
In the last few years, there have been reports from several federal states about the contacts of the "identities" with AfD politicians.
Maassen said he had no knowledge of that.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction and becomes so extremist by certain people who are extremist.
It is therefore important whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not apparent.
In view of the significant increase in the number of right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps, Maaßen said that he was not yet talking about new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have seen in recent years that there may be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, it was not possible to see the management of legal terrorism in Germany or in Europe.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen was concerned about the fact that many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in the attack on asylum camps had previously not been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who might have been politically insufferable or who have chosen CDU, SPD or left-wing, but who have then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Hate becomes an Internet hit
The Olympic or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the section was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old, with a delay of 48 seconds, finished his lead and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not very sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was given a special status by the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.
Since most of the athletes in ethopia are running, Hente just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Hate is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames made the round quickly.

The English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-metre freestyle, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also made.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run provided media attention.
Unforgotten was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to go on his own in an advance of over 100 meters of freestyle.

The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsriedin had left her business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and had forgotten to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15, some 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the imminent election defeat so closely
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida.
If it's not the US President's election, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, he would not care, "In the end, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, said Trump.
He was the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia, and was the president of the United States, Barack Obama, and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great.
The post office is planning to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
The group is about to start trading with the transporter.
The post office wants to offer its electric transporters in the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it is to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which supplies letters and packages to other companies.
The post-board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always questions, for example by craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the Bonn Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-owned production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and per shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term it would be able to make a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK-management departs after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK has shown that the longer the success he has promised the chair of head of the board Matthias Hartmann will become all the more uncertain.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company's management, the global number five of the industry is facing a new human start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the board of directors will take over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger as of September 1, the company announced.
He is to officially take over the function of a "board speaker" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesperson didn't want to name details on Friday.
Those who will be leading the market research company in the future are still unclear.
On Friday, investors said that the last time the shareholders were disappointed at the continuing success of the restructuring launched years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The results of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad business figures of GfK, each shareholder will at some point become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," they said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016 after a setback in the previous quarters.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.
Sales in the first half of the year decreased by 3.4 percent, with EUR 721.2 million.
The profit in the second quarter was mainly due to the fall in the value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company's depreciation of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience division, brought the Group a loss of 148.2 million euros under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in ditch: Eight injured
In an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (district of Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, told the police.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid, according to her, a truck to meet, which was partly on the opposite track.
The bus came to the right of the road and slipped into a ditch, as a spokesperson of the police of Aurich / Wittmund reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department liberated the inmates.
Six ambulance and an emergency car came to the accident site on the state road 2.
The uninjured passengers were brought back by a line bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
They should wait there for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators called on the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl 3,44 instead of 2,10 Euro; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lop 3,36 Euro (so far 2,26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (so far 2,18 Euro).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an excessive calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 Euro per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landrat Office of Kulmbach, it was found that these waste water treatment plants are under-covered.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal principles, to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.
As of 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the business and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take deeper into the purse.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As head of management Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overcovers and / or undercovers from the previous calculation period were also to be offset.
The serious fee increases were due to Schmidt's fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water consumption, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants fell slightly.
In addition, during the previous calculation period, all three plants had a significant amount of renovation and repair costs, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp were almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water treatment plant Azendorf due to a damage.
In the Welschenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor plants had to be overhauled from the ground and the Lopp pond sewage treatment plant had to be used for the first water treatment pond after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed in order to continue to comply with the water requirements.
Schmidt: "To this extraordinary expenditure came the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 were well below the current level.
Stone houses made it clear that, in the case of the low waste water consumption in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance "fully go through."
In this respect, Schmidt added that the market community had been spared large maintenance costs for the waste water plants in the past 20 years.
In the view of Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants would remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water treatment plant could not be extended to include these plants because they were in deficit.
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% in terms of the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed in the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurde.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unblatant, property-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All flaws come to the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the app would promote blackface or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
When a few users proposed a filter this week that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asian - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a major problem that the company has diversity.
The news and the outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was meant as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asian.
But outsiders who have experienced racissmus, the filter reminded of vulnerable clichés.
Others strongly rejected the Anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was pulled into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold.
And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believed that race-related controversy reflected a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of snapchat.
Zhu criticized the majority of the white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in her staff, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its staff and points out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently hired a staff member, who concentrated on underrepresented groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, for their part, that she will have her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that's not OK."
Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence information, notes Committee of Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a committee of inquiry of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Wehrbudgetkomit, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, typically sent by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide any direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the central command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to lower the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after being told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information during the investigation.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-level Democrat in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.
This process, said Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morality among analysts and "gave too little room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said that they had not found any evidence of the White House's intervention in the Centcom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who was received after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press officer, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
The allegations made last year, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the clashes of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government of George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government authorities, noted that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, reported the Times in September.
Cencom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The US wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is coming
One day after she had scored three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I am not one of the people who remember their gates.
However, she knows that the American women are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in the first place in their group with the British women, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and the second in their group of six teams.
The first placed will avoid the strong Dutch women a little longer, leading the other group.
However the game may be going out on Saturday, the American women have caused a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they ended up in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three had a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team and things began to turn to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work in London we have now.
We've been able to complete the rudder.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal ring in the first half of the game with a back-up from the close-up area.
India had gone into the game without winning in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in her hands.
She carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and lured the ball into the gate to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging race between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning rod, which is passed from the arm-breast-shooter to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Bines, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who was present for the first time at the Olympic Games and is a woman's swarm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that are being sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.
But if I may be modest in making arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparingly perceived over the past 16 years that many of the, I had asked, did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will be defending their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an Earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoon trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grazie of turning and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Ascending winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to have a number of falling movements (turning, piercing and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to the design, difficulty and "flight time."
Two-and-a-half athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
In their quest for gold, medallions must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only pursue the finish line or the starting wall, but also another high-level goal in television broadcasting: that of the world or the Olympic ecord.
The goal-oriented striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel as a little tiring when I watch these games.
The trampoline offers an apause of this.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she is going down, apparently heavy as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here too, there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamlike, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualifications and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase of consciousness can only be achieved by angling and objecting to male athletes - as the male US turners recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base, which is in the air.
"A generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during the shooting.
Is Ethiopia just about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and have spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that police officers shot and killed a dozen unarmed demonstrators.
Videos in circulation about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the government's oppression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and these have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Tesome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to strangling of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100% of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this contentious, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turbulence and re-armed.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode under the surface after years of being in front of it.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in the case of protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered in this way to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Aeons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have been proliferating in politics and the economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in shallow areas.
But this is also changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, who account for about 6% of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly versed in seeing early signs of discontent and using special agents to work on opponents and to make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia had such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently pampered by the government and then stolen.
During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of riots passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not prevented the internal maladministration of the Ethiopian government from intensifying.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked Tigray-led business, and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin gratwalk."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS had been "sarcasm"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group was not meant to be serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.
It also brings his fellow members, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant.
After making the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rebuked the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to slightly weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know.
The last storm of criticism shone down on Mr. Trump while trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject.
On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put forward sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he made a strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as required.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction is." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his survey values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal fellow leaders into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand at him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent supporters, made a great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it a hinterbanker, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of going around and being biased against each of his words.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" TV experts who were trying to understand him and said, "You can't do it!."
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as a further proof that he was unfit for the presidential office.
Once over the price displaced from the market, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front have been disbanded.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Local people mourned it as the last loss in a creeping city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is out and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, it's a new invention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He began working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new branch office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnish like capers and sauté onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady current of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she again drinks coffee, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is another long-standing and faithful customer since the start of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same.
"I came a quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no grudge about the soap business taking over the old business area.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we are going to deal with her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he is planning to issue it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill the cold-brewed coffee in the bottle and sell it.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the place and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for the refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water-shield turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be published on Tuesday at the Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, cordless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, the couple found it appropriate for a discussion about the food in the Great Depression era.
"Rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that would stretch the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinst.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country was dealing with not being the Schlaraffenland anymore.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for the Americans," Coe enjoined, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: secret food such as bread and casseroles became basic food, which was used as a "wonderful way to restore the rest of the food," said Ziegelman, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Some strange mixtures have been tried, as a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even common kitchen sense.
During her research of the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition at lunchtime," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical of many of the home-based recipes.
As never before, or since then, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have so driven the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housewives" and to meet the challenge of turning pampa like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical delicacies.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Let me, cake-food attitude, are delicious.
As he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the million-dollar man of the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He was eating in an almost gilded dining room and wearing a tuxedo.
He was a great stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in her taste by Ms. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate prepared. "
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple, when writing the book, said they better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw food away.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind-bag incident.
After the plates were removed at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss a nice name for modest recipes.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each of them unwillingly dipped a spoon into the teeth, brown glibbers.
I'm surprised it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a supplement three times.
Like a can-do budgeteer, he said to his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a facebomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to the Bild-Zeitung, saved almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to draw people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil protection officer, which shows him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of war.
But as a hero he never saw himself, according to the picture he said, "For me this is the real jihad."
"If I die saving lives, I think that God sees a martyr in me."
Just before Omar himself was the victim of an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing in Syria.
The helicopters have dropped four face bombs over the Alzadia district, one of which was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people have difficulty in breathing.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebral animal is almost 400 years old
It's a rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims through the North Atlantic with a good 1 km / h - until today.
Greenland sharks only get young at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark is largely floating along the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to this, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a rate of 2.6 km / h - and is at this top speed half as fast as a seal.
However, this slow-moving lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least on a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," Alexander Schehrlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are becoming stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, and they are living in the ice sea, especially in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their time-lapse pace when they put out six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitbergen.
The prey still makes this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice sea and looking for cadavers who are torturing down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which brought fishermen to Greenland or Spitbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 as by-catch.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters were measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lentils of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tried to throw large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear-weapon tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark at 502 centimeters is likely to be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland females only get young when they are longer than four meters was known.
The researchers were now able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can be seen to be at least one and a half centuries of time with the propagation.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrate animals at present.
The fact that such methusalems live in icy waters is not a coincidence.
The record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon was on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a sparse flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
For the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Schehrlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources more in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues related to building.
With relief, the panel took up the statement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated housing areas can finally begin."
After the issues of land, parcelling and development were resolved and the applications for measurement made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and rural seniors alike.
As it was said, the members of the building will be able to report to the city hall immediately, and the local council is expected to be consulted on the allocation of the parcels in its September meeting.
In order to be able to meet also requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises, linked to the creation of jobs, the Council decided to amend the new land use plan in sub-sectors only in the spring of this year.
For example, in the area under-time, the commercial area already identified there is extended by two plots towards the State road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from the Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of the Main therefore has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies moved from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial operations across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been able to obtain approval in the UK.
That's what big US banks are using right now.
Several banks have already announced that they will move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10 000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the euro area's largest banks, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority (EIOPA) and the ESRB risk centre.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had its headquarters, but this was less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, but it is also a poor sector in the infrastructure sector, as is Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easily available commercial real estate.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
In the Seine, the rent for first-class commercial real estate was also 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg is ranked 19th, Dublin is ranked 33 and Paris is 37th.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference, "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
The conditions of power also speak for this: in London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt, there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the hepatitis C case with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million compensation payment for the violation of two patents from Merck related to the Blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including the perjury and other unethical acts.
When the action was brought on Thursday, US judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to pay the costs incurred during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to equate with Gilead, who controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and took possession of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
U.S.-supported troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-supported troops have reconquered full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left it, said a group spokesman on Friday.
The Democratic forces of Syria (DKS), after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city, are currently in the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish informed the Manbij Military Council of Reuters, allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are in the process of cleaning up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which gave the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost $5.3 million in Redehonorare; the former Minister of Foreign Affairs reported an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's candidate for the vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In a raging contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and reversals in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, even though they are not legally obliged to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You're on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sam on Twitter, in relation to the release of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organisations, his business and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already turned on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-level Republican Trump is calling on his tax return to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax returns." she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants who indicate that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a minimum tax rate of 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is located here, called for Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subject to a tax review by the IRS and Trump had "fear" of the voters and not of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published a tax return back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The tax declaration of the Clintons of 2015 showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Its main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chilipowder, fireworks promote Tanzanias elephant protection
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to people-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipowder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has, together with US nature conservation, intensified its support by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Before, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Day of Fans, which is dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the... toolkit, we have been able to see a change of attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipowder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust into the air on chilipowder.
A touch quite usually already out to drive the elephant away.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold-fired fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No new kiosk building on St. Goarer's bank of the Rhine
The St. Goarer investment projects are usually accepted by those with a kiss-hand - but the retail sector in the core city is considered to be significantly expanding.
However, the city council is now unanimously opposed to the request for a new sales kiosk on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rheinbalkon under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed position on the Rhine bank this kiosk does not fit in," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin Hotel because Israeli code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli code, as it "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, for Israel to be eliminated and deleted?
= = References = =
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have asked for the code to be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and dismayed by this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is even a greater shame.
There is no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused a pretty big resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some told the Kempinski Hotel that it "gave in to the alleged calls of Arab guests."
"Shame on you," it was said in another article, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all the accusations and called the incident a "mistake" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the quick-dial list, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disconnect the students, which led the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the participants in the protest were seen to spray graffiti against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in mass to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade sales between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent in the year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, Russian companies' interest in business in the country has increased strongly, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies have established existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is based on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation spent some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, on Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, will be broken, "he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses sought: Beverage market in forest oil mugged
A robbery was carried out on Thursday night on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
In the presence of a gun, three dark-dressed people, who had suspected their faces, demanded the employee of the beverage market to issue cash and then first fled on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW-Golf.
The police do not share the amount of money they have received.
The perpetrators were supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters in size, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and can be viewed badly.
The perpetrators must have run after the attack in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking lot entrance by the silver-coloured car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladerring).
Those who have made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (around 7.45 p.m.) should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer free time
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social-educational day group / social group work of the Nagold Children's Protection Association with their carers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home of Hardtwäldle the joyous group was located during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Mulbronn, where there was a special children's guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Mulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plansing.
Culinary children and carers were pampered with their self-prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Spächle, the Seebronner Pänle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübingen-Bolognese.
In workshops, a nice piece of jewelry was made of pearls and stones, or a Roman-mill-game was made of wood.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Colorful evening."
On the day of the journey home the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home happily.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Romwalltrip of all the ministers in two years, the Upper Council round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were tested and the Bishop's City of Freiburg was finally decided, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered with the open gate of mercy at the Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and of Gruol, and of the haigerloch, and of the holy rooms, set out on the way.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the cross of the pilgrims and gave the blessing of the pilgrims.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and thus the pilgrimage path from the Münster was initiated.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and text.
But also on the way, the Minis took a rest at field crossings, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled Pilgrim book.
For the nights there were each parishes of the local parishes available.
At the stage goals Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and strong dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous way to go, had to be descended in the event of a low heat at first about 500 meters of altitude and then climbed again.
In the evening, the reward was a common grilling at the Badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage in Freiburg.
In the later afternoon, the Minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in the Münster, the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operative Markus Obert.
After the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon, we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all the participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scottie Callum Skinner storms home when Brite wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The young man made the legend proud when he stormed home to take a victory from New Zealand's favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Railway Championships, despite the return of Hays.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hindsight.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the bulkhead that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
After his round, he was just back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, in which Hinds went in a higher gear to slow it down and to allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they got on the pedestal.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set up an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a great victory, there was no such problem this time.
In the end, it said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the gallery."
We've come together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that expect us to be successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form of Kenny it is in the area of the possible that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the one of Hoy's.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten as a knight."
It was the only medallion competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Dull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.
They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
Yesterday he had a fight with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie avancied in world record time in 4: 13.260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a set of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were reduced.
Dramas played in the background, the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexual and bullying allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which at the perfect moment has reached its peak, can be repeated again.
The future of the melting of Portland due to the repeal of the Energy Treaty is questionable
The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the Victoria government at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, there may be domino effects, as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, as a result of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it would assume that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is in the majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the melting plant," the company said.
AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions' which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impact on the revenue for AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts at its annual closing of $187 million in "expectation of termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts did not affect the "ability of Alcoa to operate the melting plant or to ensure the power supply to the melting plant."
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a statement as to why it has resigned from the contract.
The industry's poor economic conditions warn analysts of the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity a year.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market] market.
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator, "he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians like?), written reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problems of Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the all-popular show-biz-uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party.
This is the cliché-based action of almost every birthday episode of a child's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon canteen on a broadcast place at 8: 00 in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publication.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim may have hit her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.
With a circumference that is more similar to a tape than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of the 832 pages of the waltz).
The unveiling of his cover star is expected to be so long-awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leaked even before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "celebrities, models" than "models that are celebrities" have been on the cover.
Oscar winner and dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a little tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised and called them "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings came back up when the news with the appearance of Jenner came out on the Vogue cover.
But it seems to be passing by the point of discontent.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your priming of Etea Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centres reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is concerned with the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who do not have any means of unjust delogations and the like - are already rejected in their request for free legal advice and assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the community rights centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the Federal Government's decision being lifted.
"Queensland's community justice centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are dismissed from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families going through divisions, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut the funds by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Justice Minister, as well as the senators of Queensland George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal justice centres and their customer communities and the fact that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to an employee in February while they were in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said that for months he had waited for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The head of the campaign, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run in Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his charge.
After complaining with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
The indictment only comes two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment people - gunmen and arms friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were to be elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for assault and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks was not available for a statement.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
There was no response to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far conducted a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin / Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the forthcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses have been recorded for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys by the INSA Opinion Research Institute for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could rule just further, this is not possible according to the survey rates in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.
According to the survey, the party would only be close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the country day with 19 percent.
The Greens, in spite of slight losses, have returned to the Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country day at 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only be 23 per cent in the Berlin House of Representatives election (2011 election: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They would be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Deputies with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss out on the move in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clabby.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they kind of come from the stone age of the Internet age.
But 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "office in the west pocket format."
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.
Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, though torturing slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
In August 1996, no one could imagine that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, but not for Nokia.
The Finns' cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
The market is now dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
To be online always and everywhere, this is today for very many people everyday.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.
The global sales of the devices are around EUR 400 billion.
In addition, there is the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market only came in early 2007, when Apple's head Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, everything can be easily operated by touch screen.
The winning move of Apple began, still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the chance.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The leaders now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
Today, on average, every German is looking at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Bummer, in charge of staff at the Siemens Board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and all over London.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question he has asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is a way of creating up to 180,000 new jobs, creating £211 billion in weather growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was chosen five years in a row as the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the midst of the world's two most frequent runways.
Now they are ready to provide a third running path, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the enlargement of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, to secure our future trade and to create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads in order to make it difficult to recognize ad blocking the recognition of which part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth struggle between the display-blocking open source community and the bystanders has been in progress since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has become involved in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad-blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad-blocking agents worldwide; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile phone advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue from Facebook.
The company is aiming for ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker said.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes up a sufficient proportion of the revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" in order to have people more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks' new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for the users, so we are planning to address the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we have instead focused on development tools such as ad preferences to put more control in people's hands.
A woman in case of suspected suicide on a Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are calling for witnesses after a woman was hit in the early morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was run over by several vehicles, including a load car, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who, as well as every witness of the incident, are asking them to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, and Gilles Hofstetter told the Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - where a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer of the negligent killing was acquitted after she ran over and killed a man who was one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and became unconscious on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went in a justified way and that a man's presence on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere, could have once established Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and yet it was slowly turning on.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus is exposing its day-to-day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected by planet researchers.
Although it was probably habitable, Venus - over the course of several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by the ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left behind -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy retires as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday and led to a low level of participation in the team's decision-making process.
Alternatively-President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I've been thinking a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth, this needs it and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of participation in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanche 2013-14, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche had a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As the Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start talking again, putting out strike
The working struggles on the pay of North Sea oil workers are being suspended, while all the parties to the dispute are sitting at the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Disputes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unit and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to start the process of the current dispute again," it says in a joint statement.
We will have a few full-day meetings over the next few weeks, which will start at the beginning of next year to readdress the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced its market rates this year by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure in the North Sea.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10% reduction for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the space to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released thousands of people for his part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega-merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which had been strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
At the beginning of this week, Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few," he said.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be compared to an average of about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the Pleyades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the starry cluster of the Pleyades.
The new data help the astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are related to the creation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of stars of the Pleyades is 445 light-years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which were created about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the" Ballet "of the Pleyades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the cluster of the Pleyades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The cluster of stars of the Pleyades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us about what we want to know more about how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes."
In three newspaper reports, Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleyades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star quits
The tears of Alex Rodriguez ran faster than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, he won the World Series with the Yankees.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his team ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he has made some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
But the 41-year-old should not be included in the hall of glory of the baseball.
For as successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted to having had banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was closed for 211 games in the so-called Biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect of having received power-promoting funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
His days of farewell also do not go unheard.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi etched.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and is said to be in the relationship with the pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang in the 4-9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympic 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping sample, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
The first official doping cases of the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games have become known before the seventh day of the competition.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critical athletics competitions these news comes at an intime.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the progeny of over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," said Xinhua in a communication: "We will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS which is responsible for the sanctioning of the athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample at Danekova leaked through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the athlete.
The report states that the prohibited substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to the BNT the B-sample is said to have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister, Bojko Borissov, immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight levers from the chronically doping nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days before positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both of them disapprove of the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletics, especially the case of Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association of the IAAF had banned the launch of the entire Russian team, except for systematic doping, and the running nation of Kenya also produced many bad news in Rio.
In the swimming field, the former crimes in China had also led to a violent conflict between the athletes.
The French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," he said.
In 2014, Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships, but only had to sit a three-month lock.
Dachau: So perfide blackmail hackers her ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey of malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, in part several times the victim of an attack with blackmail software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies have already been the target of Ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the offenders in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are now specialising in attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching a frightening rapid evolution of the malicious software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."
In 2008, most of the Malwareprogrammes were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks has been very fast in recent months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, she is looking for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailer.
In order to get the end-key code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop the business, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be at risk of losing medical records.
"We always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in the company.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the F-Secure security researchers have examined the user areas and contact with the blackmailer and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt example files for free.
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to deal hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from Ransomware extortion, the hackers become more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski explains from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that these are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building box to the actual blackmailer.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"The delivery includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailer then search for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in to one of the underground forums, you buy the set from a criminal and you order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually the criminals then order spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company's IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to prevent Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful suffocation, the perpetrators will instead be threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is still a lot higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also set new targets on the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
It sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the fund, it does not seem narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is a little off.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage area.
Not only is there a trunk of 453 l available for high-level and 1026 l for folded back-rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: The seat areas of the back bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus provide storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the charge height is 650 mm slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasant.
There is another engine: a 1.5-l petrol tank with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
The steering, however, should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes open in the tested top version "Executive."
The security systems include the City Emergency Brake Assistant (working up to tempo 32), the collision warning system and the trace-stop assistant.
The collision warning sometimes irritates, because he considers many obstacles to be "approaching objects" when ranking.
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent temper reacts to the traffic sign recognition and, if necessary, reduces the speed.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and can therefore be reached a little bit cumbersome.
The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 Euro.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14) argued that liability is only possible in the case of risks that are typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Disease case: When does the organizer pay?
After their trip, sick vacationers will only get back money if the cause of the disease is unquestionably found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been found to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, on the second day of her Turkish leave, a family was severely ill with diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Her illness led the holidaymakers to a defective treatment plant, which had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family considered that the journey was a lack of time - and complained against the organizer.
The applicants had no success in the court.
The treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume that the seawater was all right until then.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
In addition, no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - is a general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that following the acts of violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to be careful and resolute at the same time to respond to terrorist threats.
It is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If offenders had to leave the country more quickly, this would increase security and also strengthen the people's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further strengthening of the security forces, "in a medium four-digit scale over several years."
It was said that the promotion of sympathy for terrorism had to be re-punished.
Video surveillance is to be improved, arms law is to be revised in such a way as to make it more difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed obligation of confidentiality for doctors is to be maintained according to de Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical community, he wants to find solutions to reduce the risk to the public, he said, for example, of mental abnormalities.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social assistance is needed.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière is planning the use of hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was a slap for the snipers in the CDU / CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
He considered that a general ban on full cover-up was a constitutional problem.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
It is possible to talk about rules, for example in road transport or for witnesses in court.
Green-boss Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate power and ability with ever new anti-terror packages.
Head of the Left Party Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet proverbs and a strengthening of the right of residence do not bring security to the people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway provider
It is regularly located on the bypass road - here is a picture from November.
But this is to change: the right-hand lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in the traffic jam every night on the surrounding road when they drive over the highway (A 43).
The state-owned road construction company will be extending the right-hand side of the road by 700 meters next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 and 17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then turn right directly from the Hammer Straße.
The great advantage: the traffic is more early and the overall process is improved on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU Group in the district representation of Münster-West.
The distance between the train and the driver is particularly annoying, especially between 5 and 7 p.m.
On working days, the back road reaches to the bridge over the Alberslohe way and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only one-lane directed over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt about a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required capacity to take up, in particular, heavy duty traffic in two ways.
How long this bottleneck and the related business-day congestion will last, the competent national company cannot say.
However, it is expected to be years: the bridge has an official rest period until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand service, the state-owned company has deliberately chosen the less traffic time during the school holidays because it is expected to be disabled.
The traffic is carried by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House."
The Nima's Association and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students between 11 and 15 years of age visited the production in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the objective of cultural integration of young people with a migrant and refugee background, has been offering schools with a welcome class the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the class's young people came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a background of escape and migration between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to attend professional courses in the areas of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre and theatrical language services are in the planning process.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of a star: hope for weather improvement
The weather in the south-west of Germany in the night of Friday made a line through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was bad for watching the sky's spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of stars in the sky.
The star scales are persides, which are among the fastest star snaps at 216000 kilometres per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which is rising in the northeast.
Recreation night: tips against sleep problems
In the evening you walk around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep before the wake-up.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, one is in good society with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep problems and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep problems express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders and they can be caused by a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Orgasm and Sleeping Medicine.
But what you mean by it is the insomnia, that is, an insomnia and a sleep disorder.
It is precisely through sleep that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep problems?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This can include organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs.
The sleep disorder is often the expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is particularly common in a depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are interdependent.
For example, if you have a tape disc incident, you can lie bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to worry about everyday problems and concerns, Weesss gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you be with a doctor with sleep problems?
If you do not sleep well in at least three nights a week over a period of one month and is affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, advises Weesss.
The impairment can look quite different: one is cut off, tired, unsleepable, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood changes or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.
In order to ease the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, and also medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
In Germany, low-level dormitories are hardly present, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, you should first contact the doctor, advises Weeß.
It can be used to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what's going to happen?
For example, in the sleep laboratory, medical advice is given in the case of snoring with respiratory suspensions, in the case of sick daily fatigue, in the case of sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't go to lunch, please," says Fietze.
After the cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you have a nose glasses, a chest belt and a finger sensor.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get their hands on the problems?
There are quite a lot of position screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weesss counts: regular hours of sleep and rise, not too long in bed, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler said on Facebook about the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won the first gold medal at the World Short-Track World Championships in Doha, and at the same time set his first world record.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has faced his ex-team colleagues in the criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets €20,000 premium and a Jungle King €150,000 no one should be surprised at missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote at night to Friday on his Facebook page.
The promotion system in swimming was bad, but doping controls were very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look too closely at or even do it on the subject of doping.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent WADA / FINA controllers for a certain time before the World Cup / OS is not allowed to participate," demands the Wahl-Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream shop.
Airport: Bunch of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, civil prosecutors of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage theft as a gang.
At around 9: 30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year and had done so together, in a work-related and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Crime Commission 34 can prove four actions to the thieves who had entered Germany for the purpose of committing crimes.
They had taken over 15,000 euros in total.
Old buildings, a few lindenbäumchen, in between a rest of the cobblestone plastering: The Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first sight, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you pass the playgrounds, a new-painted kindergarten and a biolade.
To the facade of a grey house, someone has sprayed "ugly!"
In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here by 2017.
However, articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, have been shown in the last few weeks by burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel has been in favour of a tough action by the police against the project, the area called the "no-go zone" for police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After on June 22, the ground floor rooms, the cadtersmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police, according to official statements, had been patrolling for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the ground floor, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers left under the cheering of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before the late days.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and genrification.
It doesn't sound like a jelly that most of the time wanted police protection from the vandalating left.
The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and the police between the occupants and their neighbours do not exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which has a low average income and high risk of poverty even today compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990, many houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police order in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and some of them are still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election berlines from all over the world: with them now residents from the GDR and former house occupants share their jaws.
This is also noticeable in the rent, which has increased by almost 60 percent in new rental since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: you can see them on cast-in slices or freshly painted facades, which have been thrown with color bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often, along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence."
One reason why not all neighbours consider this a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as assault are directed almost exclusively against police.
Most of the crimes are damage to property, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there is no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is a complication: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly were not.
The famous burning cars have not been in the Riga for a long time.
For her studied architect her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."
Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Riga street - and remained.
That is why it was so important for the residents to get their streets back: from the police, the politics and the media, all of which in July all of them suddenly claimed the power of interpretation over the district.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former building gaps, which the old inhabitants displace.
"These are, after all, condominiums that are not interesting to many here - people who are not so well-off live here," she says.
"I can't agree with violence and destruction."
But what do you do if no one ever listens?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry with color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiev.
Those who move should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a bar district, can complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person on integration and the organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social teacher supports the team of the administration around Achim Groskenberger.
She sees herself as a contact for all the actors: refugees, the working group on refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the icy wool-milk sau, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mockingly than in the large number of desired areas of work - had meant when the administration wanted to write the job.
An administrative expert was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an egg-making wool-milk sau.
But administrative work is not her central area, Annika Deuschle says.
In particular, it is about organization, working with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes, as well as network activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50% job limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding apartments for the refugees who have been recognized for some time.
The local authorities are responsible for the connection.
They must place the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landrat office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work so far, but it is dependent on private apartments, says Deuschle.
This is why community housing needs to be furnished, as it says.
So new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not done with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent place of residence, it is the place of work, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," reports Regine customer.
Many work in the Bauhaus or help house masters, do non-profit work - and this is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive impact.
That's "no occupational therapy."
But activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So we need offers such as sports, contacts with local people and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So this is where the administration and the volunteers are coming in.
It was central that the refugees felt that they were welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and that they can well bridge the time, for example with language courses.
He who at some point develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach must not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people with nothing at all." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All this is already a "mammut task."
A difficult question: after the recent events, are they afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some people may call naive." But a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.
But the helpers are already aware.
These incidents were also a matter for the refugees.
They'd be afraid the assassins would completely discredit them.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honorary officials on the ground and in the region must look for activities.
They always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, the policy is shy.
Actually, it's not fair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already in the process of properly integrating the previous people.
This is currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Burglar with helicopter sought
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men entered an apartment in a multi-family house in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8: 50 am.
The resident surprised the two of them and put the unlucky on the run.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both were wearing bluejeans and black hooded pullis.
They fled to the city centre.
The police used several crew and a police helicopter to search for them.
The investigation was unsuccessful.
The unknown may have appeared before the action near the apartment or at the time of their escape.
