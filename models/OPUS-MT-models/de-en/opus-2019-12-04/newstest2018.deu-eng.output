Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city
A lunatic institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small gardeners manage the former reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to the ground.
It's annoying when maps are not up to date.
This is what anyone who had to get upset about, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian atlase, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but for this reason very revealing.
Especially when compared to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of Munich's Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.
In the large map more detailed maps, so-called prima facie sheets, have been incorporated for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and are the result of the first surveying of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.
The original page for Munich dates back to 1856 and is found like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of the former / today is most impressive in the example of the capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian farmers' uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces of land from the so-called "first-name" from which the property tax was derived.
There are no longer small parcels of farmers there - but small-scale gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original page, in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, you can read not only the street name "on the gate" or the hill "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.
In 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of the so-called lunatic.
He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working on the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients, there had been first room, and later 500 seats were extended.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, it has been home to the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatry in Germany.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architectural way, in line with the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War during the bombing.
The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as "Haupt Platz," the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allies' bombs tore many holes into the city centre.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the stage for the second S-Bahn line will take place.
With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the air image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning to people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling through the State, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have occurred and are noted here recently," the Group's opinion states.
A recent law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination claims, and the state law enforcement authorities that are disproportionately targeted at minorities, led the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"They have violations of the civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning that the organisation has issued to a state in the US.
The group cited events such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gas during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also drew attention to a recent report by the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are being stopped 75% more frequently than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring it with them, or to let their relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which rank the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the country's 16th place.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to sue a company for discrimination against housing or employment.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU considers will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but interest groups have recently used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaunproject is elementary
The Fangerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU-Bundestag members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have received a picture on site.
Representatives of the Fangerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members of the Schwendemann family.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest Milk" is the alternative way of marketing the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also the chairman of the BLHV of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaunproject as "elementary important."
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The grassland has a lot of work to do, and much has to be done with the motor sense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," stressed Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental holding and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not run a organic plant.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The community has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject and is happy about the Leader support."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3000 and 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be extended for a long time.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can continue their business," the mayor said.
The farmers are often in criticism of the support.
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were fenced in through the grazing fence.
The surface area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be refilled until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was supported by leaders, and a quarter was paid by the municipality of Fischerbach.
As a result, the farmers remained EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of Weidezaun.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac said: "You are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women."
Peter Weiss also said: "Here the best food is produced."
The Landschaftspeltigkeitline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of pastures.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The requirement is the presence of a funding environment designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be shredded (a slope of more than 35 percent) and must be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fangerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application is currently under way by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 km of fence.
The surface area is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes over the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have yelled at him if he had.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
When Miller Acosta said, "I don't want to go into this whole thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is in fact right, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the arduous words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tides, your poor, / your troubled masses who are longing to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were working to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act.
The sculpture was to show the links between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing had long wanted to change it back.
The great scribe Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early Neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh came across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the position of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And of course that's not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to light the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two bulkheads were part of the UK team
The performance director of the UK athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the UK's athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And the guy on the corner of the street.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilidh is rather modest.
Your Captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will take part in the 400 m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 bulkheads are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-distance runner Muir is on this path and last year set up five British and two European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Cup when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me," she added.
"I am obviously very proud of all the bulkheads that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we got.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podium.
As for my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just gonna be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not apply for public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to its political principles.
He was pitiful of the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to see Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?."
"It's just Facebook," said a lot of people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary warhead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict respect for the principles.
He was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whip online.
The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news show "The Post."
"I do not appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are rather disrespected by some as a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical key articles, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's what's happening digitally right now.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for shaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question was in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterwriters hit his lead.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't shut her up.
Freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for local comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordic, who in the next year led the Archerfield links to the final round before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen the Renaissance Club built, and we see it achieve its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he fixed this place.
He is a zealous supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course. "
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always appreciate. "
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on the home floor.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad to see how this has happened. "
With the trio in the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, the parking price is £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer by passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
This is the result of a study by scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study director Heiko Mug.
In comparison, he used his own study on the subject of 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
The number of household connections is very complex.
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "some time is in progress," says the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of domestic connections, the situation was more complicated than expected, as there was a lot of underground hiding, which was not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which always hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and lock-off bars is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road was closed and only the scheduled buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kosorz and Tim Kosorz of Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kosorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian gold land
If Bardina Degei is cooking dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the coiled tuber is taken from and swallowed up with the zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the lobe - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, for example, to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5: 00," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hibernation in front of the occupying forces.
An existing movement, which stirred up for independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which has control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua-New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning car ride by car.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs, which have been converted into different yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesian people have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans venerated a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold land.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a high-land province of the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport's value of $3.1 billion was reduced to gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which will ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
An investigation in the New York Times in 2005 reported that, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970's have become genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" is said in a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane in 2016, which contains reports on the atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are, according to another report, particularly popular - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsino, Indonesia's Human Rights Watch researcher.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese maintenance canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"Migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to work in the provincial capital Jayapura.
"It cost the local papua - the mother [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The scared children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took a push on their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking hunted and beat the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - in a circle and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, an order was sent to the soldiers on an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," it is said in an official document of TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for rest and asked the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who was the witness of the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesian people, only has one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta on the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical maladministration in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism for the resolution of historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through, "he said.
Then Wirto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
The UN accused of "crimes against humanity," which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Rising villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witness to how the injured were quickly brought in here, according to the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the mobile brigade of the police to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai was always a source of concern for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and abduction of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested in recent years and arbitrarily detained under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: above all nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nola only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own companies in a competitive way.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been realised.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him to "We want freedom," according to a source that also attended the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robberian military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai victims carried out a last symbolic act of trottism: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that perhaps they will never be given justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, a fire was found in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape from the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to be swept through the high-rise house in just two years, which is by chance called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and people's screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire-fighting units at 4: 00 local time (00.00 GMT) erased the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cover, the outer cover for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and disguise at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two winning rates was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
The very long, but also very much appreciated, five-set classics are thus preserved for the traditional competition.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, and the aim of the ITF President David Haggerty was therefore only slightly missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions, "Haggerty said.
They will continue to work to improve the application.
After many objections, it was not only for the vote that the proposal was made that the final be carried out in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only relatively smaller details: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places, etc., will be made easier and the players will have to do less official media events before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring prohibited items on the plane, find out a survey
A survey of air passengers showed that more than 20 percent of the objects that were deliberately or unconsciously banned were being smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent that entered the plane while they were wearing accidentally prohibited knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had been erroneous with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were rather disrespecting the rules.
Of those who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something that was banned by TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to having knowingly carried objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it had asked travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many would have done it on purpose.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were the ones who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA Directives are a little complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about the liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of the items confiscated by TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could look at books as a smuggler.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
He has so far considered that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla's head, Elon Musk, has, for the first time, betrayed a different, less brilliant number in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: that of the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
In the past few months, Musk had frequently advertised with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now, Musk admits: Of the 518,000 preorders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."
At present, 455,000 such non-binding reservations were available, and Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84.000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models together - it is expected to be 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently available per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in a host.
EPO leader Pruitt is retreating because of the delay in the rules of Obama-Era to reduce emissions
One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of public environmental authorities than to previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a federal appeal court.
It is about a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental rules for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries are resisting.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that its reversal of ozone standards would simply increase the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Among previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have seriously. "
However, the EPO's opinion said that at some point Pruitt will use its "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on a sound policy and the best available information."
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists rejoiced about Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer itself to environmental polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlings celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16 at 4.30 pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "It is a unique village little thing."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in the Wuerttemberg book of documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold the "mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg there was also a magnificent court, with the exception of the former parish church, to which the Church or the right of the Patronage belonged and not the other way around.
So people also lived there.
As the description of the "Oberamt Freudenstadt" of 1858 shows, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are now still to be seen in the picture of Tumlingen, the "Berg" was the third, the ruling center of the village.
Old maps from the period around 1600 support these historical conditions.
The right of the patron was established by the early medieval right of the church.
A Lord who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
The right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop was associated with this.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two crumbles at Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616-1648) the window windows were hit and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops were stationed near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead of the Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was abandoned.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On the New Year's night in 1834 a storm split the church tower and half fell.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the current Turmzwerg was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentnähnen" are the successor of Dieter Dockhorn to the Hilarius plant.
As the organizer, the friends and sponsors invite Tumlingens to the sixth Serenade on Sunday, July 16, to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Inlet is from 3: 30.
To the end of the serenade there is a drink in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumors and listeners.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade-Organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind wheels tested
"Boisheim resists himself" sees no legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved as at that time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are in principle possible, but at the same time the concentration zone does not allow the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
These areas should prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by a change in the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim is resisting itself."
Current state of affairs: The city council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This is where the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is not subject to planning law."
The circle shall confirm receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week," said a speaker.
The circle takes them as an occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to cause the process to be stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district did not wish to express its content on Thursday on the argument of the association "Boisheim is resisting itself."
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four wind turbines each 200 metres high on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
In the past year, the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved had already concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare area.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of about 11 400 households is to be met - that is about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-star households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens Stadtrat gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was killed in the process.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to the police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich took her car with her 53-year-old mother to the direction of Bogel.
City and Dealers Plan "Home Shopping" Weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business club and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure the inhabitants to the shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to raise the awareness of the offers that the own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
It is therefore planned to have a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre should invite you to "midnight shopping."
The action is not only aimed at the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, said Christian König.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The business club and the city thus go into another stage of the "Attractive City Centre" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the well-being party and sold Sunday, discussions with all the traders and hosts to make them participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the renunciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be reopened or reopened.
These include students and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city centre - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly spread, that King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five cities in Thuringia were first involved in the country's third "home shopping day."
In addition to Bad Langsalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleiterode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and make it more important for the common good of our cities," says prank.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after an explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people have been hurt.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) there was still an injured person in critical condition.
A person died when a part of a school building fell in the explosion.
A first missing person was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday period, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico on the payment of the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On January 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The President of the United States denounced him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US and swore to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "bad," "stupid," and "stupid," and that the existence of the trade that was mediated by the Obama government would make him look like a "douche" after he proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: activists reintroduce racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and rattled to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came out to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-striped suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates were hovering in fear.
"We want this n -- r Roger!" the man yelled.
"Get him out of the car!"
The silence was torn apart when a young black man was dragged by the passenger's seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a replay.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience had a very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been coming back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It is really unthinkable that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the organization of the reconnaissance.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life-long civil rights activist.
For him, the redesign serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner puts a bed towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farm owner Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor was that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to the prison.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, Harrison was the one who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more concise.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you. "
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-establishment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their representation is vivid, touching and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe does not exist in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We do not want to talk about the lynch, because we will then be confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - went into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He's been playing the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive, because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm, who yells at Hester and pushes him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n -- he, get out of my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n -- he'."
"Yes," one of the other black actors waved.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that is where the energy in the room is moving, a feeling of cameraderie is replacing the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharp and strong.
No one's laughing.
This repetition ends in a violent and fast way.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a funeral dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's grieving praise "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced Georgia's pressing moisture every almost eight hours, when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you're in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song stop, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and to inspect the body name.
Children sit on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper at each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters like he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchrope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw hugges Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down weeping in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason. "
Later, the audience will be working with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is talking about the rearrangement with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance feeling.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions coming from people who look like themselves and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds the court at his table, he eats and reminds of the civil rights.
He said he already started planning the performance next year.
"The redesign is in a way inspiring, for it describes the terror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is so, if we do not learn from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are doomed to repeat it. "
"Dusk of God" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also relies on a colorful-frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-story setting.
The filming stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner, including the Wall Reg and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Paste and Elaste" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer is parked in which the Rheinhöchter pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through its "ring" production.
The three Rheinküchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as well as in the "Rheingold."
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), takes a body into the trunk in Hollywood-Manier and gives the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful, nasty hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Fester, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in a stormy manner, who is modest and who is bending his hands to the Merkel-Raud.
There is great applause for the Festspielorchester, which will be shown on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat again in a few casual clothes.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was expected with great excitement.
In 2013, he had to pass a wonderful pipe concert, and five years later, there was great cheering, in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festspielführer Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about it.
"You can see that the audience has grown with the" ring "in a way," she said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of his view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Tange works as a volunteer
They work in a number of places in their voluntary year.
Where?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school in the open whole day.
What are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late volunteer.
How come?
Quantity: I've done an abitur.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me, and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I was wondering, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on site, in the focus, perhaps also.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I will study in a dual way, probably in the youth office Herne, do a social worker training and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a little unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your FSJ.
It can be done from the old age home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also in part in the OGS, in other words in the afternoon care.
For me, it was just the right thing to do.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head, who have a whole different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, or a young person who has been taken out of the family - one must always go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you were not afraid of touching?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are negative moments, too, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job reduction, which was mainly announced by Director-General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is in addition to his previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost-reduction programme a plan to reduce costs by a further £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was taken by the fast step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had achieved an increase of 1 percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, told a statement by the Nato.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died during the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A statement by Nato states that the explosion had happened on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was "attacked" by a "person-driven improvised explosive."
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO returns decision to delay the smog rule after actions
The US Environmental Protection Authority has lifted a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama government, which obliges States to reduce the emissions of smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the Agency for the step.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to move forward the so-called "ozone rules 2015" and said it indicated the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPO head Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to delay the ozone rules - to measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to return a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have triggered the setback of the Democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that the inhalation of air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
The Council wants a common area
In the end, the decision was clear: in the case of two votes against, the council of Fluorn-Zinkeln decided to set up a common area in the future senior housing area.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the land is signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area to be owned by the church community to be in the community, there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be carried out by a private investor.
There is a discussion on this about a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council have the right to provide such a common area not only as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the seniority-like residence, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knickcafé" went round.
The decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget in the past autumn is sweetened by means of support.
The building is located in the renovation area.
Tjaden reports that the establishment of a Community area would be eligible at 60% of 30%.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that in this respect they do not want to throw a stick between their legs, provides for the conclusion that both saddle - which is based on the environment - as well as the pultroof - which reduces the height of the river and makes the construction of the economy possible.
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer think that this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps, he's going through the board unanimously.
The common area is not so easy.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which one does not really make progress, for which one is now leaning out of the window in the common room, she says: "I am doing this very hard."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against local participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a grant, but get a real, in case of doubt, equivalent value, is the opposite.
Staiger's request for the decision to be split up in line with the proposal for a decision was made by three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller summed up in this way: "If we take the decision in this way, we take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Radler is thrown on the road
When crossing the road, a 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike on the road of the road Schwarzer Weg from the direction of Hilden at 12.20 am.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went on the road, he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic.
He met a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must renounce David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The supercup takes place without it: David Alaba has to let the game go against Dortmund.
With staff concerns, FC Bayern is going to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website * Official website
The staff concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 am / ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalwinner Borussia Dortmund.
In the duel with the BVB, coach Carlo Ancelotti must also renounce David Alaba.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the Münchner Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical state and the missing balance in the game of his team responsible.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It was not good at last. "
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intensive game. "
The duel of the two German football heavyweights draws the fans into their spell.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the resin from star to star
The first "Starpath" is to be created in the Harz.
The Sternwart Sankt Andreasberg Association is planning this.
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
He combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-attainable installations in five to six places" in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegreiss and Sieber would be in question.
The information on the boards will be added via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile phone reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the Starpath train is to be extended by train.
"On the starpath, the viewers experience a lot of interesting things, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association said.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star was more light than another, even though it was much further away.
It is also directed in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
The club has been operating the highest-located observatory in North Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
The Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with the naked eye are often clearly visible from there.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Starry Weng - the Planetenweg.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our solar system, the planet path leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto at the end of the dwarf planet - are located exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun measures at least 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres.
While the light takes about eight hours from the sun to the Pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council light-weight champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimps noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I am a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I have ascended for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I am not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on light-weight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give it to them. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimps asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to agree next summer with Garcia a date (37-0, 30 Knockouts) that is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all fans have asked for it," said Garcia and later expressed an open view of fighting at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he would appreciate Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he might be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the Triangle Champion from Riverside would look "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the moment that built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "
Four injured by tyre plating
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partially seriously injured.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 4.30 p.m. shortly before the connection point Marktwide probably after a tyre plating.
The car swung to the right into the embankment, where it overcame and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then traffic on the left-hand road could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
After the 2: 2, Andre Hoffmann hopes for the start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation will bring points in Aue.
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, would not have been the two opposite goals at the 2-2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two counter-gates too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the defenceman of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge the three-chain is to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick the Fortune don't want to catch any more.
"For the future, no one will be on the line next to Michael (Ransing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better equipped with the three-chain than with the four-chain, even after the experience in the preparation.
"I do not yet know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build well in the three-chain at the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, but we are even better at harmonizing and we do not afford so many playoffs in the building."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a draw, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay, "said Hoffmann.
"But if we stand on Sunday with four points and can focus on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be broken off early because of an unweather.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, saying that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension Favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know so much where they are at the moment," says the interior defender of the Fortuna.
The guests from the Rhineland, as an easy favorite, are going to the meeting on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we have the right to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the start," explains Fortune's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Bank) was criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were under age.
To date, the Migrationverket has sent 6,880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were considered 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age."
The tests shall be carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been constant over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was considered to be over 18 years old does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases "suggesting that the person under investigation was 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI-images of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, were also criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the method of measurement should be used.
The assessment of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could, "he told the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is that if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "
Full in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well advanced.
On Wednesday a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it is going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager of the department of road and transport in the government presidium of Freiburg.
In April the work began at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted arch bridge, which is covered with red and coloured stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and safety of the road, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, respectively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach now received a 1.30 m wide and seven tons of so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a border attachment, which is also used as a operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path is to run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach has required special fingertips.
Because there is also a glass fibre cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by hand.
In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished at first.
For the bridges between the Bauhofbuilding and the collective consecration in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a single traffic light.
For construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bound protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties are on the same line, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to bring together.
The parties represented in the "Kreistag Vulkaneifel" (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on that day, because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the "big campaign start" according to the poster.
And well-known names bring to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on the ground hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the people of the country, but want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the well square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rindell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that can be seen there.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Eine Welt and one of the relevant organizers, is really pleased: "Great, how many people have come together here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "German potato salad, which the AfD could eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence in particular at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulcan Eifel reports that he has made an effort to make such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but received a cancellation there, because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there are not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
With a view to the event on the Rondellvorplatz, he says: "This is the good right of the people, as long as it remains peaceful."
It does, too: At around 8: 00 p.m., a band of entertainment is provided on the Rondellvorplatz, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhenland-Pfalzian AfD-Chairman Uwe Jöger.
There are about 200 listeners in the room who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour the AfD event takes, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but there is also a short after 21: 00 cleaning up.
The police can leave - no special events.
Trombone meets trumpet
A reunion with the Wolpler trombone Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher Kloster Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets the Black Forest," or "Balkan Folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in bubble music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
In this way, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new dress, Daniel Schnyer's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz-champion Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything out, "says Kristen Stewart very openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'."
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was the one with her "twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually went apart bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously. "
She had suffered especially from it, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in the school period, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I'd look like a boy.
I really felt attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think: 'Girl, be proud of you!'. "
In particular, they do not like to explain their love life to the public: "People expect you to act in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the whole public. "
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, "said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement to the West Virginia Rally before.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday night in which it said: "The change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," said RNC President Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
The world's leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as a clear excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-admitted to sport.
Russia's Athletics Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the banishment of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to redeploy Russia," said Coe.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-employment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and prohibited trainers are still free to work, he said in London, after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Obituaries for soldiers who have fallen down in Mali
At a funeral party in the North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1000 people of the two soldiers who were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security arrangements.
On the unexplained crash case, Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) did not say anything.
However, she described the two inexperienced pilots as "the master of her specialist."
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old staff captain from North Hessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of Sankt Peter on Thursday, accompanied by a wake of the death of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the family members in the church first took their leave.
After that, the funeral party began in the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the German Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The guests of the palace laid down the roses, and the family stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen described the lost soldiers as "highly decorated" and operational experience.
The chief of staff had built up the operations of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained tigers pilots in his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersach, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, said: "If this crew could not turn the crash away, then no one could have."
The United Nations mission in Mali did not have any doubts about the fact that the operation was dangerous.
But he was also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That's what the royal house told me on Thursday.
The Danish couple is traditionally buried in the Cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed to the decision of her husband, it was further stated in the communication.
The place where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French home country.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to have been king.
In 2016, he retired and was named "Prinzgemahl."
Since Henrik did not have the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself to be equivalent to his wife - even after the death, Lene Balleby, the head speaker of the Danish royal house, said.
It is still unclear where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French home country, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's been working for over the last 50 years.
The son of a French noble family, Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames at the French Embassy.
While his later wife was always at the embassies of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand with the Danes in his almost 50-year-old regency.
In an autobiography, Henrik said over the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco, who had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed of myself.
That was two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
After the loss of the red-green majority, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, Parliament was in favour of the dissolution.
Before that, the surprising resignation of a Green Member from her country-day group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official election, the Red-Green Coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green Member, Elke Tweiss, founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said in Hannover on Friday.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group that they be included.
This would make CDU and FDP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been the opposite.
The new country day will be regularly elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the country's day of self-resolution is decided as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility of the country's day of abusing the Prime Minister's confidence and choosing a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legal manner, "said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace when they are legally sound."
Thümler called Twestern's step "a little curious."
The politician herself said, "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She called herself a follower of black and green.
The Greens called on the renegade Members to return their country-day mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her country-day mandate, which she has received on the green country list, with immediate effect," said the country presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group president of the Green Group, Anja Piel, said: "We are extremely sorry about the decision of Elke Tvern."
They have deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transition of the Dutch Green MEP Elke Tvädner to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only treason to the voters, but also treason to the red-green," wrote the Federal President of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the country's day quickly.
The exit of Twestens costs the majority of the red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the well-being of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty play of intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Niedersachsen's CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputies that Elke Tweiss be included in the CDU.
The group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Tvädner of falsifying the result of the 2013 national election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at that time, but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic agents, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Fellerwarnung.de, the federal states will provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the German authorities became aware of the concern.
All information and the risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, as well as the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe.
If the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg / kg is exceeded in eggs, these shall not be able to operate.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it's not the companies' fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in the event of an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of consistent competence?
It was, after all, the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that it is of crucial importance to provide a consistent information on such events and to give them to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may be present.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and efficient food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The combined means have put manufacturers, traders and consumers in a situation which is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and completely.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Some consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar signs and takes him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich family of rulers of Qatar.
Clubs can spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to use legitimate sources of revenue to counter them to allow them to break-even in their business related to football.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from the focus on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - was to become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini has fallen in love with the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksandr Ceferin continues to work to discourage excessive expenditure.
"Certainly, FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount of the accounts over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that for the next five years the total amount of the transfer can be shown in the annual accounts of EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, took the most serious sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the normally 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenue from companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered as a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the World Cup 2022 organization committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, because they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsenen Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play, because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new market supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now there is a possible end to the sweet cooperation: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott, at the request of the news agency sda, confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.
According to the current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the speaker.
About 17 million small red-white-packed plaques of 14 grams per year distribute the cabin crew to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Nordwestschweiz" to be between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary has an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is all the more important: it is a prestigious order for a shoggy manufacturer.
The Swiss does not want to tell how many candidates there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey is trying to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate plates on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-range flights, the first class customers are pampered with delicacies by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the business class wet passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the economy class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short distance, both in the business and in the economy class.
Athletics - Diskus Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches the World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the Olympic winner of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup selection and could only look at the Diskus competition from the gallery.
In the first attempt, Polish champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres far, also qualified for the final match.
Nostalgie goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90's grunge era (when the forethinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening to the core of the gas - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they still created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting-can principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that rocks the cradle").
At one point, a character robs through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The kind Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot, in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the ex-courses are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard of "Singles," whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could heat this franchise up like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," the last scene of which will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another type of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-against-West Ringkampf iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as a director, says to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The leading roles - a hard-sotted Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police spend time watching chess on TV, how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides for a decent game 'find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes, it goes there, and the comedy is not fast or common enough.
"Comrade Detective," which was edited to a lesser length, could deliver his Agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef are constantly visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a joint.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with their own.
Blow against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor told Constance on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials provided large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were in the operation.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the Public Prosecutor has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in the southern German region.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Rottweil Crimean had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, four officials from Palermo accompanied the major mission.
The investigation focused on Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant in the morning, is expected to go to the gang's account.
Weise laments large gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "sometimes serious misdecisions" in the case of asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign nationality are registered, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
As the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who are no longer alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and were not supposed to appear in the register."
"Incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes," says the report.
The statistics on people on leave also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave.
However, such false arrangements have led to "a distorted debate on how to deal with those leaving the country," it is said in the analysis.
In the meantime, the German Government seems to have begun to send refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 when they have entered the country.
This is the result of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrück Zeitung."
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "with regard to families with children, with the exception of infants and micro-children, to Italy since 1 June 2017."
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU state are responsible for the first time they reach them.
When a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
For the reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minors in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy had provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECMR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic political spokesperson of the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened with human-rights reception conditions and a threat to the child's well-being because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Oberreichenbach already provided the predonation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who, with his 100 donations, now shared 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, the community at the meeting of the municipal council has recognised the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even more unselfish," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the district manager of the German Red Cross (DRC), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned ones are decomposed into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK district management director.
Apparently, the change to the theater house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Already before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many as Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger book, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times per 500 milliliter of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have slowed the speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.
The decision-makers of the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 in favour of keeping interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking to increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that in the next few years interest rate increases would be necessary to curb the inflation heated by the Brexit, and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut economic package, which was published a year ago after the Brexit.
It will be asking for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this system - with £115 billion sterling.
The Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, GDP remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to be a burden on consumption."
At the interest rates, she repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly greater" level than the markets expect.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downward adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared with the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31, and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced the increasing expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP in the second quarter has increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the Bank towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases, as the tightening up first becomes even worse before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent the fall in income in the next few years," but she added that wages will recover "clearly" at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the fall of interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to reach prices and the economy in full.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy-makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and that it will be back on in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its 2% target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again, as the lenders are very much looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of existing deals and complete the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-sexual exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86%, is now provided by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the process after the appeal court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for the PREP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England leader Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants who agree with the study are identified, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is used, included and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said, "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We very much welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, Chairman of the Management Board of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us to come a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society. '
Living the great life: the middle floor and smart designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was similar to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit the 1.000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room estate with a tiled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the best use of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other without having to bend.
It was not only a question of building a simple platform, but of building the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the middle floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne's stoves and glasses.
By the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
It's not a new thing to go together.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A little engineering went in there," Erfan explains from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it's very easy to glide."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the floor area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the land."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fighting for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in an argument over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to share her property and business assets.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul has about one-third of its assets.
A court record says that this means that Colin owns the value of 316 million dollars and Paul owns the value of 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed referrals.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but that Paul is accused of incompetent management of some of his possessions.
In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he is hoping to settle the argument.
"My Italian heritage requires the family to be the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held on both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had dairy bars and delicacy shops from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jean shop.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he "was high school in my last years, when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to pass on their property to their sons in kind.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, while Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "have been bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin was very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media made contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much," because the case is in the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current fight," he said and added, "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the Chief on a more equal course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior staff on his first working day, he was a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of positions that were to be convinced," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control is, according to six former campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media use includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something we don't know to others - that Trump's tweets would have contained more fuel without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts have been worth their while.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the advisers' preference to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press excerpts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened to find out where they come from.
This is what happened at the end of February, when someone miserably gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source of a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that in the past he made false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove himself a more effective manager as a priest, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still seeking influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
As the address is unknown, the help of the population is asked and hoped.
The police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are naturally not known, references from the population are hoped and asked.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the winter "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar.
The experience had shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, it was said by Europol.
There were 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them based on information from the website after publication.
Travelers negotiate on a ditch and return to the 'millionaires' series
Some of the wealthiest house owners of the West Midlands are back at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a trench drawn by the community to claim a field in front of their manor houses.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "millionaire series."
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters, after they were only thrown out in May, but without being scared off by a trench excavated by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that was not prevented to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the Council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after being sent away by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The passengers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it. "
A resident who did not want to be called said, "It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travelers, just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area. "
A spokesperson from the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and we work with the Solihull police. We take the necessary legal steps to make them move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case. "
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the forest hotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30 000 nights per year were lost at the time and also revenue from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Landrat Office as a collective accommodation in the face of a dramatic increase in the number of refugees who came to the district, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed at the time in the municipal council.
But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time now, and when you enter the house, it is clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were torn out, some of the ceilings were removed, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything was to become "nice and close to the citizen," as Thomas Scherer expressed himself.
"We want to make it a piece of jewelry."
The facilities include a swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high level of downtown, Scherer stresses.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its about 60 rooms, wanted to be wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual vacationers, groups and business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He had already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, said Scherer.
The ideas of the city are the same as those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
When asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise decision.
Just under a million euros, he's expecting.
The outside systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: US special investigators use Grand Jury
In the Russia affair of US President Donald Trump, the special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The panel had started work in the past few weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" on the basis of people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigation.
The station CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret services have been accusing the Kremlin of having been specifically involved in the 2016 presidential election campaign for a long time.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted in the election campaign as a Republican consultant.
According to reports, Mueller also had more and more Trump's private and business environment under the microscope.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally moved to the center and investigated the accusation of whether the President might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to charge.
Grand Juries are therefore also called the indictment chambers.
They are usually switched on when the cases are larger and controversial.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The body may also be used by the public prosecutor to invite persons to be heard under oath.
According to the CNN, there have already been invitations to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, said the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's counselor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign leader Paul Manafort were present at the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday night on US television that the establishment showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he would want to act quickly.
It should not necessarily be said, however, that the Grand Jury would end up being used to decide on the charge.
However, the establishment of the body was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," said Trump.
The subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know about the setting up of a Grand Jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president is not being investigated.
There was no reason to believe that this had changed, the statement continued.
However, Mueller was only used after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this disgust, he had made accusations against Trump that he had wanted to hinder the justice.
In June, Comey told a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation of the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
This caused speculation as to whether Trump Mueller would be released.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair about the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the request of the President.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be released so easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has been disbanded from the Schelfeis.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which is over a trillion tons and is 5800 square kilometres, now drive north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
He does not think that there is a danger to people.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the closure of the iceberg is unclear.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapse of ice-cream in the region, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this bead the balance of growth and demolition was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete flaw had been disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and could fall apart if a piece of it is broken down at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it results from the melting itself.
However, the loss of the Schelfeis results in the glaciers entering the sea and being able to flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas) writes.
According to AWI, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters thick.
There it breaks off on a regular basis.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly fall apart, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not lead to the demolition of this gigantic iceberg due to climate change, in the last decades a lot of ice-cream in the Antarctic Peninsula has been disintegrated.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice area has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature increase had contributed to the decrease.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature rises fastest.
CDU wants to have house status with staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU calls for the employers' association to leave to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the district day has wanged through 41 new places in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now again 17 trainees have their first working day.
The teaching places in the circle are obviously very much sought after.
Some 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff in order to be able to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the district of Mettmann.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are being sought.
The CDU now wishes to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district day and to face the shortage of staff in the administration.
At the request of the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept for the acquisition and development of personnel."
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but to address the future-oriented of the applicant shortage, it says.
The overall approach should be oriented both inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle is dealing with staff problems that you never knew before.
Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The debate is about a real "competition of public employers."
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
So it's time to act so that no more jobs are left unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU's group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently provided a feisty surprise in the district day, when he publicly questioned the coverage of personnel costs and surprised the other parties.
People want to see all the possibilities that allow them to leave the local employers' association being reviewed.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions, perhaps in cooperation with the city-related cities," said the people.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which is based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
It was only a few weeks ago that new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitutes Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, the Landrat Thomas Hendele and the district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone of NGO-Migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turkish daily La Stampa.
Minnig's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Save' because their team had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that made illegal immigration easier.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in a statement on the social media.
"We can only judge all the allegations that are being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Save', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that his crew will take on board tubular-boat migrants who will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to keep to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring "significant changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organization is doctors without borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy following the rescue measures has fallen sharply over the last few weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two visitors met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friends of the Guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed points of view, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer increases, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the point of view was at the point of view, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate ascents.
In the last two days, many meters of altitude were required again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in the open-air inhalation of healing brine.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is preparing for e-sport
In future, are the sports stars in front of computer consoles instead of being sweaty in the wind and weather to fight over the stadium lawn?
The fact is: E-sport has long been a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high margins.
This is also recognised by the first German lira clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start of the 2015 VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and the last of the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says the board of directors Jochen Röttgermann.
He is certain that "on this train there are still a number of clubs."
The following weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup," in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football.
"In particular, real football must deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be present online much more often than only once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation are played at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have established, in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of a habit.
Ingo Froebel has also been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
There is also a need for cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fat player is a good player."
But it also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue."
Control is difficult to do in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
The scientist positively highlights the high inclusive effect of e-sport.
The players are on the move internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth of e-sport.
In 2016, Germany had implemented EUR 50 million, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, sales will be 130 million.
This is not very much against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, the e-sport is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already further international.
In the United States, it is the second-largest player in the world, and the second-largest player in the world, the second-largest player in the world, the second-largest player in the world.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot to be done in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject, says Froebel.
In the Netherlands and France, the first-league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB's board of directors Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia and to clarify the old times is not enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," Dutt also says.
"You can't hold on to the fact that it's the only way it's always been in football."
Gift Eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal of toxic eggs has now affected almost all the federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and all the eggs have been taken out of sale throughout Germany.
In the shelves only eggs which have been shown to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts that Conrad Roy is pushing to suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is uncomforted.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy had a mental disease.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down-looking eyes when she was sentenced.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She did not take any responsibility, "she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance she completely regretted."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that "there is no day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all the pain we will have for eternity, "it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "persecuted" by the realization that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having the only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stone yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered her to benefit from the case by some press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to be a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner for a big season - extra motivation does not hurt.
There was something different in his place in the cabin, that Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even if the additional garment was very, very small.
But since there was no Philipp Lahm and no new Manuel on the second day of the Audi Cup, he made the tied to his arm.
"The coach did not announce it," said the Confed Cup winner after his first engagement as a Bayern captain.
Well, the stand could have been better than the 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But the coach's sign could make Kimme feel the same way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf, which was made up of youth players, deputies and just retired professionals, but he.
The best way to distribute sugar is to give it to those who have a lot to trust, who you want to keep in a mood.
So those who have been chosen to take on the heritage of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flickered over the field as a mini-lahm.
At the right side, this is his position, the white tie on the arm did the rest of it.
And at all, Kimmich seemed like the one who can take the rudder in the best hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed force.
He had the view for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal was to overplay his missing fitness (hardly rattled); Renato Sanches was to come out on the devil to connect to the achievements of the Asia journey (even in a limited way); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle were not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bavaria jersey.
That worked out very well, after all.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to make a few success in the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not what we expected."
But he also showed a proper performance in the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "I was taken for this style too."
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new entrances, one could see after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but was certain to have six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye to his new players after a few crunchy statements.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria, you just have to win every game. "
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new people.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our public service ladies
Austria's most well-known football player just before the game came in on Twitter and wanted the best for the public football ladies.
The Bayern-Legionär is a club member of ÖFB-Kapitän Schnaderbeck and is playing with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian Football of the Year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivation.
The famous Bayern-Dusel might be a good thing for our ladies.
Company satisfied with Rheinland-Pfalzian Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often imreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on the T-V question of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister is blaming.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that has all blocked Lemke."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
The Ministry is still hoping for a planning procedure this year, and the construction law is to be established by 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the western circumference of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal road transport plan.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says Minister's spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sown for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the completed master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates make their own business within ten years of the master's training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts were to be created quickly, while the country lacked the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to stop Wissing in the country's operation of mobility, only 29 jobs have been occupied so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to the Court of Auditors' calculations that the country invests more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept from the country, as it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
He also said that the existing broadband expansion in the country was disappointing.
In 2016, regional companies evaluated the network supply in an IHK survey only with the Note 3.4.
They complained about stocking Internet connections and abortions.
On the other hand, ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still on the board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she left the field after four months of disagreements.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counterreaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company was of the opinion that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pacifying the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which have been able to control the use of so-called off-turn devices to comply with the requirements when a car has been tested, but to return to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emission rules in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft runs through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
The one who draws it to the Isar on Saturday will see a large raft there between the Flucher and the Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft with Isar tourists.
It's the building department that wants to clear up.
On the raft you can see a large information channel.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protected wild flow.
Last summer, the river passed through the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo tuber noses and the laugh for the suffering
At times, Mordillo was one of the most published cartoon artists, the tubers of his characters are his trademark.
At the age of 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: "Laughter," because there is too much suffering in the world. "
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he was, among other things, a teacher of congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made the breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist was always inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures are in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he is still sitting at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for large and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his thrill figures continue to be widely used worldwide.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-foot opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is supposed to be on the screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're gonna say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he is more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the disease, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only attractive for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil. "
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and a slower evaporation from the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thüringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year anniversary this year.
The high point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, Zünfte, Dealer, Vagants or a land-sknecked camp are to be seen in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce meeting usually on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and continuous drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer: to take their children to the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, business people, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are increasing throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 have been under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter are their editor and inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," is on the front of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamel.
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a Special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa even though they are uncomforted and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we trust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "12th River."
The shooter left in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's most bloody battlefields, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, someone or more people are shot every day on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleas for drug kings who are bigger than many houses for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of "peace" if only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
However, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He thinks that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he merged with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without the problem of narcotics," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take over the task that is for you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, "Was his love for the routine his destruction?"
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean business, their secret runway," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. Days before, it was announced that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
There were two police officers outside looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were one of the 50 percent of the police officers the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government expenditure, which focused on the governor's home town.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the state's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military robbery.
Only a few months before, the readers would have considered the column of Valdez to be the best-informed source of the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body statue.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez was rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the Public Prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, it's his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organised protests "SOS Press" on walking paths and buildings.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for the justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked for the government to redivide her because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by order of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with the organized crime.
Last year, the media guard group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipa six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade is scaring him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of a sudden all of them started to hum their phones.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the borderstone edge, they have published the news on the Riodoce website over a mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who held the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street to report."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies
At first sight it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miners were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "uncalm past."
The report in the "Current Biology" magazine described him as "the best-kept armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodinosaurs that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His unbelievably well-preserved state has astonished researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herb is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock at the place, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of the earth's clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will be included in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."
Researchers have found that this plant-eater, although covered with armor and similar to a walking tank, was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white cover to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a countershade used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed a better mix in its environment and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurs family made the first headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully uncover it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.
They discovered the counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than their bottom.
Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or girdles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodinosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for evidence of his life, including his conserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much further inland than they are today.
"This nodinosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just shove your eyes a little, you could almost believe he's asleep. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, an 38-foot (11.5 m) long six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-kept armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that were on his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was flooded by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
The petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread up.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
In the storm: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometers of traffic jams and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured during a mass carambolage in the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5: 00 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg), almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were intertwined during a thunderstorm.
The exact number of injured persons was not available at first.
They were mild to moderate injuries, said a police officer.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a 10-kilometre-long backlog was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there have also been massive disabilities on the counter-road - through numerous Gaffers.
The fire department took note of the characteristics of the vehicle handlebars, who now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: There is nothing to be afraid of sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep into your work and you have a genius thought right now.
And then, pufff.
The conductor comes and wakes you up or pulls the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions will soon be over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.
You can simply confirm by phone that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two lines.
"If the offer comes on, let's extend it.
It will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes, "said a railway speaker.
"Comfort check-in" is called the ticket devaluation without a conductor.
However, in order to be able to use these, some requirements have to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You also have to use the app of the train that DB Navigator bought, which is the most comfortable way of booking tickets anyway.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
The "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, you call your ticket under "My Tickets."
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.
The train attendants will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to place Y during the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with already lost online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train accompanying staff, you can simply check in in in in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train, "says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing board.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often go on the train know that, in addition to delays and missing trains, the ticket controls are one of the biggest problems.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document that you have to present is missing.
The result is endless discussions between the train crew and the passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of your own ticket and at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same line are not yet open.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "What Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it was said there.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly reweet on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed live by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," said Ferrell.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She left her phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who were screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who was wearing a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another cop took his gun and yelled, "I will kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we've been getting used to, and we can call it typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and wept. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11: 00, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the next morning the two would go to Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and of resistance, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who had a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me, "said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a climax of... what happened in the past.
She must know and see and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it. "
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has changed completely after August 9," she said and noted that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come. "
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white people, in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought the project closer, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whare Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We talk," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, for this is how I will be represented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whare Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider black-live-matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in senior positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and that is why we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women."
However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, even though she was at the front of the line, because in a life at these crossings, there's so much at stake as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos."
However, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
From "Dream" to "Size": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, even though it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold doesn't leave the subject.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some people say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Greatness!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, and the other shops also benefit from it, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the property on which the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work it will end.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always very happy.
We have also discovered the butcher's work for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is especially interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
However, this is not likely to be very low in the new project. "
Eva Klic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugged or supermarkets, I think it's unnecessary.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rent there is often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special business and what is left of it will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farm market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or is the ghost bit gallery already able to drive out all the shops from Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "It's just not gonna work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.
But there is no place for a farm market hall, thanks to the vast many - I think - useless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farm market hall is broken, another piece of culture will disappear. "
A matching resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek-swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making public classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a leading dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - from which 30 portraits have been created.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly speaking about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which manning was clearly unwell sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blond wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette dummies and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people might look like.
This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They had an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you made contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letters, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Supported Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which provided for a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
In fact, only a few days after the book was published, Obama would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further ignite the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which was sex, race, sexuality and culture, with her oversized signature (the" i "in her family name is with a heart).
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfoot of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the artist's advanced scientific lexicon), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, that's why that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a free-phone in her hand from the United States Disciplinary barracks like King Kong.
"When they kill your speech, they won," they say.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who says hi from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was previewed in the comic book - but if it does, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by its own genomic simulators, which are like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
A country-wide human hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are wanted as a suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued with warrants for murder for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of the event, and detectives are investigating the stings as a murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Since 2007, Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been on leave and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investigation authorities in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he was urging the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their location, and our efforts to locate them are increasing," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it has nothing to worry about Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-supported doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system has accepted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist. "
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In a conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one is planning to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.
In November 2015, as part of the Doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was moving "in the right direction" to be redeployed.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
The groups of companies reported this.
It was a mere precaution that no health impact could be expected further, the communication said.
From now on only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which had been shown to have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lice.
Aldi wanted to make its customers clear and transparent.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees' luck at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never any consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software, which has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow Whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite managers and directly contact the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Errett said that they won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so you can drill up why.
Companies come to see that the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convert, which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in miscredit.
Convert has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convergence lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The public opinion court has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convergence.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or acts unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convert for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way of reaching their company headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company uses Convert, problems that have previously been hidden by leaders in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee involvement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have both supported start-ups.
Convert received $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only operations.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefit and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convergence and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and use of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee involvement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have too much relied on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves," Did you really hear me?
You gonna take care of it?
And who you don't care about it, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, said Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you're gonna lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes to 11: 00 when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new practice fields on the campus.
Some have removed their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactivity minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
This is why the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7: 15 p.m. in order to meet the players' already full schedule.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the six seasons of Moras in Westwood.
They are to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA's change of rules, even if it added another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep plotting, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task in view of the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel, which has already been thrown with foot balls that have left a net behind a gate post.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then getting ready to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to intensify facts review in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party file verifiers and then display their results under the original post, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It's one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to evidence verifiers who may display results of the evidence examination from the original article.
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential elections, and Germany is supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the September elections.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook said that in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched.
"In addition to the knowledge of what stories are being challenged by third party factmakers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "related article" and will work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Create a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshire man with a preference for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says in pain.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
"A Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobines," he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell of smoke, because then a fire was set on fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was there.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I have overrated my welcome"), this all seems to be too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape flyers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it in the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who had what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that fought for the two families.
Guys, let it all go! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves on a broader basis in English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two of them are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is presented, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always making debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to promote the first. "
After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has made a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämämäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been called back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to get back to fucking life."
Campaign started: over 300 years old Mary's Chapel in Röndorf
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Röndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for the introduction of a new badger (round show of Thursday) on Friday.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
"The makers of the action have been asking on the posters at the Röndorfer Chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website that was released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
In fact, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer, we know citizens very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The action is about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique position."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a middle five-digit amount of its new badge and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on the retirement and promotion of the officers' corps.
So is this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it was in the Prime Minister's office.
The five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the President.
The civilians in the YAS were in the overnumber.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, the head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who Erdogan sees as the warden of the coup attempt.
For 486 people who are to be directly involved in the coup attempt, negotiations have been held in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already described the attempt to fall as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean the armed forces."
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unease in the Military Headquarters."
In the general staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifested itself in the lifting of the ban on the head-of-the-head of female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale reconnaissance of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be the real masters of the country.
Three times, on the basis of their role as a guardian of the secular state order, they were puzzled.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least on the basis of the European Union's reform targets.
Former officers say Erdogan is specifically driving an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the "Vocal Europe" magazine, a name-not-called officer, who was looking for asylum for the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that in a few years the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists."
If that is true, such a development could not leave the Nato cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the alliance about the commitment of the Turkish army after the cleansing.
The management structures and operational skills were "weakened," said Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US is spending green cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for racecap shuttle
Over and over again in the past few months, the future of the race stage shuttle had been discussed - now it is to be done very quickly.
It is planned to be built before the end of the year on the rough route on which the tourist railway is going.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the racecourse shuttle, the Ministry of Transport says that construction work on the line is to begin this year.
"With the decision to further order and redo the Ilmenau-Rennsteig line, the country is committed to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," said State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of the repair of the line was estimated at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75%.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being definitively voted, said Aühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as an operator already agreed on the technical details.
"This negotiates the road map, the vehicles used and the quality standards," said Aühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company was concluded for a period of 11 years.
The Rennsteig shuttle was to be ordered on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations.
In recent months, a pilot company has been tested to see if the route is used by a sufficient number of people to order it regularly in the future.
The line is also very well-developed in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything, from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it is even more worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," heals the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the course of the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, be fixed to conversation or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step towards Frigid (means here: disobedient) Farrah, worry one the most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap in the fact that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has been proclaiming to have sexually attacked women.
The most terrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') is not the graphic images, the stranded bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just go away.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they're good slaves.
Or to express it in the words of 2017: maid
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the healthy human mind
It has become a sign of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-format families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.
We're all supposed to be trying to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and very strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I can see in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the degrading effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and "Trump," we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will not be able to reject us.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" Republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear to be the epitome of sensibility in comparison to its standards.
I now find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's very funny version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - both of which, in fact, are a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel in the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climping music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, since here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40's and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop table.
This not only results in a slowing down of what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store was excused and grinning, while I was tired of the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night-long intruder who was hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of his sentence being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
The last of the Blumberg schools were the fourth-graders of the Futzen and Epfenhofen in the holidays and the secondary schools.
In the future, three of the students who have been dismissed will go to the high school, four to the real school.
On Tuesday evening, head of school, Angelika Sitte, welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Bürgerhaus in Eppenhofen.
As a symbol of the school release, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm but was then released into freedom.
The band also performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Court."
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and had it brood out by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken, and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain, and departed.
After that, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goggles who wore cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said head of school Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but is one of them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His destiny was to be free.
She wanted every fourth-grader to feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of school Michael Müller, who always jumps in at teaching passes, and the parents' representatives.
The Kükzeit is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it had been a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
In the end, all the students made a song of summer and holiday.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first-graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camps in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, informed.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegal people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, while an investigation is currently under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased control of the free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have computer software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the German Federal Motor Transport Office (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has announced that he will write to each of the parties concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within the framework of it.
How long should the overall rearmament take?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far."
How long is the update supposed to take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What are the drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would be following, according to Smetanin.
Is there a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But in the regions where driving bans are in danger.
In rural areas, there have so far been no losses in value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and take part in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
Lear has already announced that he will not be able to participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to take away the means - and that is what is bothering me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her view clear.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city building master, will retire next year.
The job is already open - but suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city building master.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he teaches in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time.
In this way, there is still enough time to be involved, taking into account the regular periods of notice.
As Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the management community, the applicant must provide such qualifications.
Because this function is what the city wants to keep.
If they could no longer fill it, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But the city and its own citizens are important, says Wacker, who reports on a good operating climate and good mood between the public and the public.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure of the building office and his employees.
But in the future, there are still a number of different projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the low-floor parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a subject.
The latter alone will beech with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun. "
The design of a city building master was very much in place.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening, it could be quite flexible to react to a lot.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green areas is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
As the old town as an ensemble is under the protection of monuments, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder stresses.
In any case, the city building master has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "In the end, everything is going over my table."
In support and coordination he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (building) has been in the company for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been in the company for 15 years.
Wacker also wishes his successor to stay long: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
For continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, those who want to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed study as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction planning and planning law.
The town building office is subject to building and civil engineering, construction management planning, basic business affairs, management of the urban properties, the town farm with the Bauhaus and the town garden and the Lower Building Authority, including the protection of monuments.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South track closed
According to the police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bike from the railway transfer in the area of the Leoben Street (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so much that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators are from two male offenders and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the scene of the crime, witnesses had been observed by a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a coup d'état," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch on the APA.
The offender or the offender would have put himself in great danger and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of the rail replacement traffic, there could also be pönals of the railway customers to the offenders.
Overall, the speaker said that a "significant" sum should be expected.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south line could be carried out without any disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had been cancelled on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable condition, which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the people concerned are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that immune cells are patrolling in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, this may result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is present in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan, which is more tolerant and less flammable, should promote darmilieus if the same system is effective in humans.
The postdoctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was isolated, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the darmicrobioms of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice 'intestines were sequenced with DNA and six types of bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing without them in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a darmicrobioma and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
High tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genius," believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' preparation-Asia tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admits had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to meet three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for which I thank the club," he added.
"I will be happier when they get four out of four for me, but they have made a lot of effort."
Boeing "painted" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots left Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and took the form of a Dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had done such advertising before.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New deep beat for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, the Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before the elections.
It was the most important wish of the campaign fighters that was not just a fire from the party's centre, but only a counterwind from the Federation.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was deep.
One at a time.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network of Germany (RND).
The surprising political outburst of a Green Member has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost their one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the renegade Green Member of Lower Saxony to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Elke Tweiss has to return her mandate immediately, "said the Federal Executive and the Green Party's campaign leader to the German editorial network (RND).
"This can't be true," a SPD election fighter sighes, as the new Hiobsotschaft reached the party center on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, will be there without a government majority after the transition of the green MEP Elke Twehr to the CDU.
It is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
It became that too - and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tumble, the Düsseldorf-Bleitung killed the party in a smooth manner.
The comrades rattled in the weeks after that.
Then, when they had just taken new courage, the G-20 summit in Hamburg came.
And with him came the next deep.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonia while his city was burning.
And because in the crisis communication after that, he did pretty much wrong everything that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
The Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time because of the VW exhaust emissions and his role in the Supervisory Board.
Bad survey results were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps because of it, Weil has been increasingly trying in the past few weeks to set accents in the covenant.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden from comrades in the context of Martin Schulz.
They let him be granted because they promised to stabilise the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
At the same time, Weil is not in fact guilty of the party-internal compulsion of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And not Schulz at all.
At times the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, the renegade parliamentarian Twedenn.
"It is unbearable and damaging to democracy, as Mrs Tvern puts her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Bundestag group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Tweiss was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony Member continued.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, is lamenting an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The electorate's will four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result," said Oppermann.
He asked for the background to be clarified.
I want to know if there has been more, or if there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for local core III
Those who want to rehabilitate their house in the years will soon be able to get support from the country.
The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development informed about this on Wednesday in Sensigen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been redevelopment areas in Sensitive Areas.
At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the total funding.
In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant still stood at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it was important, after all, to promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new building areas.
On April 4, the Government Bureau of Karlsruhe had received the information that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The total amount of support is 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 Euro would be from the country, the rest from the community's sensibilities.
So how does a rehabilitation area come about?
One will, according to Schindler, continue to examine where the "really old" houses are.
It also has a role to play, however, as to whether there is any interest in rehabilitating the planned area.
If necessary, the boundaries could then move again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the "Social City" programme, in which the renovations would be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per land.
The renovation area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The grant period for the support has been running from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the inventory would be carried out in order to fill out a questionnaire for the parties involved in the rehabilitation area.
In November or December, the law will be adopted as soon as possible in order to start the redevelopment process in the coming year.

It is a question of assessing the urban maladministration and deciding when to redo it and to what extent.
The property was then also subject to a redevelopment note in the land register.
Pietzschmann himself would come again to sensations and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Mr Gotzel stressed that the participation of the participants was an essential factor for the success of the project.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet," which deals, among other things, with the state of the building and the renovation plans.
The grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet," provides information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a residential area.
The blue "farm return" shall be completed only if the building has business premises.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funding works according to the "Windhundprinciple" - who comes first, grind first.
It was not possible to "reserve" any funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Stellkern II" were shown to make a "tasty" renovation for the present.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House's advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, according to the military, which was left to the TIME magazine, taxpayers will cost up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was exhibited in addition to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire-fighting car and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on July 17 at 7: 00 in the morning for the event at 3: 00 and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6: 00 and 9: 00 in the evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff remained on the ground for the time being.
It was not clear from the records made available to the TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the destination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," said the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was called official by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate, and he encouraged efforts to control government rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump carried out an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the background of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and its Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show" Made In America "- which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to drop the US President in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in the issue of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
However, according to the US Ministry of Defence's hourly rates for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
"To set the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates of the refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press officer, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that. "
It was not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and with the media he was joking about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website * Official website
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow at 11 o'clock in Kiel at the table-riding Suchsdorfer SV.
In spite of five games still impeccable balance sheet, the leading rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has the sense of reality.
In any case, team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the rear positions I find the team very good. "
In particular, the high-north imports provide for class and stability in the search-dorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to operations in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double, "says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this will be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck. "
The new team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue-White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the French currently active in the Challenger tournament in Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga game, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays at the tournament in Liberec, comes to his first use this season.
The previously undefeated Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was to be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the training staff around Marius Zay is filling the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed the law on Wednesday night to strengthen sanctions against Russia.
"In his power to pass the law," he etched, the Congress packed in a few "unconstitutional rules."
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for European companies to be punished to help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
As a result, investors of the local OMV have been concerned since then, who, together with other European companies, co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2.
The threat is huge.
However, it was too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by an executive order.

Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is brought to the centre in the row of hits by Netflix
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad guys on the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bethe, and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city has 46 kitchen aids
The city reorganizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With fixed contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's day care centres.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city's day-care facilities (Kitas) in its own right.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid, this is a good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooking is still out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates in the Krefeld area 46 day care centres, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time.
In the last year of Kita, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who have 45 hours of care have lunch in the Kita," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care, if children stay until 2: 00."
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September: they warm up the food provided, add salad, raw food and fruit, portioning the meal individually, give out the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the length of the hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"In this way, they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the central administration."
This is also what it is all about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is therefore useful.
For the children, too.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity was important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in terms of the cost of the city's own resources and the allocation of foreign resources, it is said from the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are being rehired.
"But these hours are not so much in weight for about 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, President of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be running for the Council elections in the provinces. Three women will be running for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an election process that is linked to the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be handed over the power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million registered voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the 13-year-old men who were with friends on the Kolping Street spoke at around 2.55 because they wanted to use the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old, however, refused to ask and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, but this failed.
The duo fled without a prey.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to check with the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie on the long-term commitment to production in its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said that the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
McVice's owner, Pladis, said he's invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's head of business, GMB called on Scotland McVitie's to "express concerns that the financing for the modernisation of production lines would not be advanced."
GMB-Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is a deep concern for our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force is strongly concentrated on the local community and the Glasgow region, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie. "
A speaker from Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to this, as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our rabies site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this. "
Did the PSG Barcelona warn about Neymar three years ago?
The site of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in her persecution of Neymar after she made an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did you warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 a week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this view by the PSG President three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, it will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its offers for Neymar.
Roller thrown over and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately threw a scooter in the Königsfelder street in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle's disguise of more than 200 euros.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, ask for information.
In an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car was coming to meet him on his track, the driver of a VW tour had to avoid and touch the guide.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on the way to Leese on the B 215 from Stolzenau with his VW around 7.55.
In the area of the town bypass of Stolzenau, a car came to meet him on his lane, so he had to avoid to the right.
The tour driver toured the guide plank.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the approaching car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the car driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the responsible vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau on Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnender, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would very much serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their false assessment of the events at that time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that in reporting on violence in the domain, "two-fold measure" was measured.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future, but it is striking that the "degree of media manipulation," said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of the daily experience and is preparing public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
In the interview with the Bavarian Radio, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth "beating was a very normal educational means" to "deal with the insidious children, as I was."
They would find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In the context of the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often also appeared.
Quite unjustly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who is responsible for the education of the Diocese of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "To sum up, it can be said that in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
However, in contrast to many other accused people, it is noted that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even bring together positive memories with him despite violence. "
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is in his opinion relieved.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of the exercise of violence at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a domain spatz did not perform at the top of the music.
How do you consider this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: When you make the effort and read the whole 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more about why the name Georg Ratzinger even appears in it.
He is devoted to only eight pages and is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The acts of violence at the pre-school also took place outside its sphere of action.
One can at most blame him for being too late or not having taken the first insinuations seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all the respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also presents a very excellent witness, describes him as "warm," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," a very good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candy and "was always surrounded by grapes of children."
Only a minority complain about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to a break-out.
The fact that he not only banged with chairs and threw the key band on the ground, but also shagged the ears and drew too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted, deeply regretted and apologized for it years ago.
However, in order to save his honour, it must be said that in the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s, such methods of education were widespread among parents and teachers.
Do you still know such methods of breeding?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state school.
In comparison with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the acts of violence in pre-school, these are, of course, small.
It is a question of whether it is not more about his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell on him.
Many people who have never understood him are still working on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a great deal has been reported in the context of the report on the subject of abuse in the Regensburg domain cats.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also being charged with any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Very clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have confided in the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one of them said in favour of the others, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was, and is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader, who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it's... really absurd to assume that, of all things, boys have been more intrusive, more clear, or even more open than to their parents, interns, teachers of trust, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and / or their environment were entrusted with it in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of any co-knowledge.
So he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or having brought him to the report.
That is why there is no reason to link its good name to these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "violent processes" at the Regensburg Cathedral.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschau."
Does he have to live with this charge?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything in the reporting was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence processes and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is the abuse of the report in turn.
In fact, there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the high school of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let's say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with events from the period since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beating education, the cases in which boys were harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and were horribly suffering from them, all of them took place at the pre-school in Eterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have rained.
But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domzatzengygymnasium.
The subject of "pre-school" was taboo, as most witnesses stress.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "Paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this is also true of Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even in spite of violence, have combined positive memories with him."
The only reason for this is the accusation of having looked away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on the pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself, and from the operations at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger keep his ears closed before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz Gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.
In this he pointed out to them that "in the pre-school, the penalty is still being applied."
In view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when there was a long time ago a ban on punishing in Bavaria.
Before that, they were in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people concerned may have been overworked or dramatized and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the school was officially abolished.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism," that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards.
The Princess is right.
But of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and not to what was done in the pre-school of adversity and violence on innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was at that time the usual.
This is all very terrible, and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, that is to say to draw slags and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg period has Georg Ratzinger given in the discussions with you for the book "My brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of a beating sentence also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedral cats played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not know that he had a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form a world-class institution from the previously well-known Regensburg Cathedral, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candy alone, you don't make a big singer out of unruly boys and stand before every success, no matter in any field, but always discipline, passion and self-overthrow.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and have seen him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-faith, and heart-good person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could do anything to even one fly.
I regularly get to know how many former domain cats still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict to them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral cats today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a kind respect person to whom they are still looking up today and who truly worship them.
And please, once again, very clearly: all that is being accused of is education methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have long overtaken this time.
But it's very unfair, a man just because he's prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.
The evil intention behind it is only too obvious.
For the report that has just been published will relieve him.
Now the decency, a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one else would know the Regensburg Cathedral, would finally be left in peace.
