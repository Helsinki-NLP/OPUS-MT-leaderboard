The main task of the kings was to build a tomb, which was thought to be as timeless as the stars would seem to remember it over the sand of the time, in which everything else sank. The planning of the afterlife was more important than the life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led to the walls of this tomb, in whose stone the scenes were carved, to remember it. Of course, many things were charmed, and in the later period even battles were presented that had not taken place.
