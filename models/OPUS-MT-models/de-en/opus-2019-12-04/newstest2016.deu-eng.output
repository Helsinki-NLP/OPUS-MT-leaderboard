Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
The meeting should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that was discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been exciting for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The deal for the Iranian nuclear programme, which Obama has promoted, has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans to the US Congress, Netanyahu had made a controversial speech, some of which was considered to be an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, and a meeting had been rejected with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel at that time.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb, with a somewhat disgraceful voice from the police, told him that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a hand-written note, which was written on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was, according to the authorities, in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school site, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call some time after.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his life as the police encapsulated him.
One day after the university shooting, the students and teachers forced them to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, with 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not be a guarantee for him of an automatic way of working as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's performance."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's lead when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb himself killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the back of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
In 2009, Lamb began his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lambs' long-time friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was all right.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared at a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weak-lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmonic game in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and we were kidding each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar programme and specialized in American native and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
On Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, staff, students and members of the community, took part in a candlelight memorial at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Vigil, during the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a Day of Healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that in his emergency call, Lamb called Prentiss his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that it will not hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and sales centres all over the country. In the Christmas period 2014, 45,000 people were still employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start with a call for proposals and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays are even months away, the Christmas business is coming closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great time for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and I'm starting to realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it seems to me that I am a simulated yawn and an army-length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had a premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "the biggest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only make violence and misery worse for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the margins of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in meeting a nuclear deal with Iran in the face of the crisis in Syria.
8 Survey values that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have put him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper ranks in surveys, it has (yet) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump lead in the two-digit range, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate moguls.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain, none of which won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's endurance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they were either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they're "angry" if he's the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they're "excited" vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).
The next one in the field of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office, and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC / Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their student hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a survey of CNN / ORC last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is gaining majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to hit him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS / NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little over half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change the mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of the public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombing of Trump will keep the decisive Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC / Post survey on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing it.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new levels.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC / Post Monday survey say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellly angry."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a Reetdachhaus on average costs 73,300 euros.
"The offer of objects is naturally limited on Sylt," it says in the study - that is why the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 Euro per square metre for a student shop in Munich is not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top places of residence, the price seems like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a list of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters in dwindling heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros at a time - per square meter, of course.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here for once.
Champions League: Bayern-Dreamstart thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a 3-0 earned at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their first game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52nd / 90. + 2) and Götze's hit (89th) earned 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth start in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to take the handle pot to Munich in the third run.
In his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bayern lead, Müller received benevolent help from Olympiakos-goalkeeper Roberto, who made a flank of the world champion pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern-Captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich people kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including the famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
But the Bavaria, undefeated in seven European-up duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They took a bold approach, but often too unimaginative to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by a game shift on the left-hand side of Douglas Costa, who rarely got through to the former Brunswick Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the upper left corner.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2-0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos-Sturmer Ideye Brown hit the head ball of Poland off the line (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, which Torwart Roberto parted with his knee (35.).
Although the Bavaria raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set conifers.
But Manuel Neuer was a good goalkeeper.
Like, when he took a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Before the new one, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did it well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the squad, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero had only given the green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, that is already evil."
Also at the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the hit Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, by elfmeter Müller put another one on it.
Before the game, there had been riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially suspected Bayern fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the followers of hosts Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went with batons against the Munich followers.
At least one Bavarian fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke do not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news is that if you do not do so, the risk will fall quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely in order to increase the 2.5-3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 3,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE stresses.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The link between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore due to more frequent gums in smokers.
The extent to which smoking also increases the risk of caries is not clear.
But people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research."
However, it could take more than ten years to get the risk back to the level of non-smokers, said first-man Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
It was necessary to convince people to become non-smokers, study director Heiner Boeing of the DIfE said: "Smoking shortens life time."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to the old age.
In Germany, over 20% of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists meet the remains of the late antiques at the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
For the repeated time, archaeological finds were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic-Museum have dug up skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist office for archaeological ground monument care.
In the third phase of the Rheinboulevard the archaeologists now found.
From text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century there was a fortress and in the 8th century a church, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman died at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police asked the people for help.
On the early Wednesday morning around 1.40 o'clock the woman crossed the tracks from the direction of the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the federal police, the train has caused the most serious injuries.
She was treated on the spot as a medical doctor and taken to a hospital by the rescue forces.
There is no evidence of the reason for the night-to-day crossing of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
In question are residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be provided under 24-hour and free of charge hotline of the Federal Police under telephone 0800 / 6888000 or any other police service.
Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the European Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private conciliation bodies for disputes between groups and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which is much more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said Cecilia Malmström, Commissioner responsible for the EU.
The Swedish plan is to bring the proposal into the free trade negotiations with the US as a European negotiating position.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the US and third countries in equal parts.
For the first time a second instance is planned.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of opposing their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it will work towards an International Investment Court, according to its own information.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS), especially required by large companies, are considered to be one of the main reasons for Europe's great resistance to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can make damages to taxpayers, defer national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact considered the EU Commission's proposals to be insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a great step forward.
The Commission took into account key issues in the reform that Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel had developed with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration was off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European Business Europe Association warned against the fact that too many new rules would limit the scope for action by the economy.
It was said that this could put small and medium-sized enterprises in particular at a disadvantage.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
A framework for the agreement should be established at the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be no longer valid.
Delicious Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy-looking folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost seized by Stevens's talk.
He tells on the basis of various places, which he always records on the map, about which his minuciously and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his home country.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative lunatic.
With the 2003 and the third album "Greeting from Michigan: The Great Lake State," well-composed songs appear, which are harmoniously very close to American folk in the late sixties, but can drift into great opulent at any time.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" is the first part of a series: each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine "Seven Swans" has already appeared and is breaking certain expectations.
It's a reduction in Stevens' performance.
The guitar and the banjo are enough for him.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
In 2005, "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Anoise") was released as a full-scale masterpiece.
Binding to ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album goes into the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses very large electronic pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
The stage shows here become the colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decorations.
The band is currently touring Sufjan Stevens as part of a five-member band through Germany.
In the dark-held Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, the clearly mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you can hear: the lecture is "more opulent" and you can throw away the "record" in fact.
Only for an encore does Stevens give a modest thanks, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bow down with a touching applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time is very much awaited.
The new Labour Chairman, Jeremy Corbyn, is to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and for the first time to engage with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and by the workers in the vicinity.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, for it will come after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour Chairman's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the national anthem's singing during a commemorative celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of Tory-Mps and is at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A speaker from Mr Corbyn said he "stood in respectful silence" and he recognized the "Heroes of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, said in the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow employment and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman who has been facing David Cameron since he was head of Tory over the Dispatch box in Parliament for the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and that he has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontive, and that he will refrain from "bravery" and the fight with disgust, and instead has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor and that he had addressed John Berkov, the spokesman of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became the leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics of a "casperle theatre" that is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
As it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow Members, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': Homeless young people trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg (er)) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their environment and make a profit from it.

Pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose as a result of data showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom. At the same time, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most recent estimate of the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009.
The pound increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and had climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the acquisition offer of rival AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said that he had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment for the company's rating on "sell."
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports-holding company had reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are a threat to expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On the Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Luppy 21 years old, a hanger with an upper-class crisis.
The guy with the platinum-blond hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More like it.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
It's all right.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the Polin is sitting on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: This is where you Idol, whose poster is hanging in Stettin, has been living since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much as her mother Ewa deserves in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "Actually, my Viktoria should be in the 10th grade in the high school."
"I will fill her with a dream."
compulsory education?
Who is it?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He's taken care of anyway.
For the advertisement in the Super Bowl's commercial break, he took three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pick company, and rinsed many, many dollars into the Beaver account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the shop table, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stare at the window window.
He is said to have taken over 100 million.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others point out that Bieber is at first place in the United States and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to be followed in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to the idea of potato dör
Potatoes or döner?
It is both in the potato-döner, which the Oldenburg imbess owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the word "potato instead of döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
The idea was brought to him by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Döner," which he had seen on TV.
Since then, his shop has had a barbeque with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered with the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
As a result, Alhay does not want to tell Alhay how much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the world is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground-resistance campaign to combat Aldi-Income
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-level campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Simmo from Dunsborough, who distribute samples in IGA stores and store owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment is carrying out its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcashs IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the East.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that, 12 months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million of sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the East, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash has made contact with Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is resisting and investing more than $150 million in order to match sales prices with coles and Woolworth for hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label food.
Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and shop recovery programs will increase to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, in the view of the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is often called "Special Ks," was in the spotlight of the notorious discussion of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka with the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, saying, "Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios, and I should have hit the child."
While he was last seen as a tennis racket, after a cramp of a potential US-open-win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against the UK.
"One thing I'm rather jealous of is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the fight," Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost to the US Open because of a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a bat with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he's been doing extremely well in the US Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's working very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's been respected in the changing area, he's training hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take account of Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra as a long-term integral part of the team. "
"First of all, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around it," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary explained the state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held down all those who tried to get into the country illegally. Everything with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border, when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's country and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter was hovering over them, the migrants "opened the border!" shamed insults against the Hungarian on-call police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" for migrants to be sent back from Hungary while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels, no common immigration policy could be agreed.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not set its hopes for an early action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions, which was called on Tuesday, gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are in search of a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force in Hungary at midnight make the crossing of the border or the damage to the 4-meter (13 foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also set higher sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree in procedural terms to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security consultant for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to fix the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push itself into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Wahl-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders is halved in national survey
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the first elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidential office, receives support from 15% of the democratic voters of the pre-election.
More than five months before the first election, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their election than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton has a great lead in women and the moderate, but these lead has been reduced.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has been futile, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead in the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the national elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Maybe not surprisingly, that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the primary elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and the selectivity are also quoted.
As the Vice-President has a potential for the President's office, 57 percent of the democratic electorate would like to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not.
When democratic voters of the first elections are asked who would be their second election for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
When Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this figure of 78 percent has fallen last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees it as the "most selectable" has increased.
However, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about voter.
In the same way as last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these voters of the primary elections.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results on some important features of voters of their party's pre-election.
The majority view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best off with honesty in the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion about it.
Democratic voters of the primary elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as ideologically in line with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions on Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs are still being asked, most of the Democratic voters of the primary elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their overall opinions.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general Clinton opinions, although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had worsened.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the national voters also consider Trump to be unhonest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades in the lead.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush best cut off with honesty.
A majority is more likely to see Sanders as honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is getting close to Donald Trump in a country-wide survey
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News / New York Times survey
The two candidates now account for half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support is growing by 23% in the last CBS survey, which was conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well received by demographic groups and that Trump is above the level of higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% last month's support to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is increasing in the polls - it ends up with 19% support from the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The recent ABC News / Washington Post survey also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
With a view to a Carson ascending last week, Trump found some side-bumps for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to call Trump's faith into question.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vacationers to find still warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go into the sea: The water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) tells.
On the other hand, the Mediterranean continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a bully ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said he had been exposed with his eyes tied with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and he was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about a headache, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide Utensilen and put the good of the Brotherhood in principle above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to the head, hull and thighs with blunt force.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died every year from the harassment since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brethren and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended a third-degree charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also being charged with harassed attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood has withdrawn its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
A rise in interest rates is coming, and the house is going to be on the rise, yields for bonds are going to rise, and the economy is going to slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, in the end, market participants could find that the whole excitement due to an increase in interest rates may have been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money, "said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at too low a level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset income to be devalued 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after the Fed's interest rate increases.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate increase, rather flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Plant Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the event of a Fed increase in interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 have only twice had nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have been looking for a Fed's interest rate increase all year round, and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the future trade is only 25 percent likely.
"In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and have put pre-recession heights in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery," the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market is anticipating an increase in interest rates and the pattern is quite similar to the one on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, the yields seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction is made in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategies of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer convergence of yields between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones says, that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a stronger monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flat, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
In general, companies that deal with the larger part of their business in the US will benefit from this if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse, as an increasing dollar will make their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debt.
"History shows that" quality "shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial increase in interest rates," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet exceeded on average 5 percentage points by each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility on their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Company with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts have different opinions on how fast this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for its "degrading"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits.
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the station to prove that he is doing something that the private channels are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-law radio station is "stupid" and is increasingly not to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 doesn't seem - I like to use the word" stupid "- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also directed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn anything else about classical music.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to order new works, I think it is really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was necessary to work harder to hire the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that, during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, was under fire for the commercial rivals to step on their feet.
Tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC way."
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our own stable" next time it started a entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of other series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased the slowest in August and the Black Friday may be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday stopped spending in November
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the UK's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure on August showed the lowest growth since the beginning of the records in 2000, with only five percent increase on the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and fall by 2000, it has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He said that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started buying with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is coming to an end, and we may experience that growth is reducing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average number of buyers was five times around their computers to make their bargain, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought for a bargain, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of 5 £issues, just over 1 £was spent online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca in the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part to the burden of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane fell into Mecca's Great Mosque.
Grieving filled, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed by at the Holy Site, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the beds.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the Bin Laden family building company for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beds that were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch.
Saudi officials have already made a firm commitment that the Haddsch will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the crane's arm when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the state-owned Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden Group was also responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman vowed to reveal, which caused the fall of the crane that fell into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the Haddsch, which later takes place this month, gathered.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the cranes and its representatives have not been available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for non-current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's large-scale Mosque as part of the massive construction project run by the Bin-Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990's.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) be paid to the members of the killed and that the same amount be paid to permanent injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B & Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has been increasing
This leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q sales outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home.
If you can use a hammer or a brush to paint walls, you seem to be a minority today.
Because British people increasingly employ craftsmen to do home-made jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the building market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe, who offer services at low prices, is now obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops, which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B & Q sales outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, men predominate among the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends, with more female single households, more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said, "There's still a majority of men working in our stores.
We must move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the head of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-year profit and sales after the group owed the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new branches.
Aich / Dob officials for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Champion Aich / Dob had to be responsible for disloyalty and tax evasion at the State Court of Klagenfurt.
The defendants did not know guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the Attorney General Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation had revealed that the defendants used funds from club accounts for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011, through which they were allowed to dispose in their functions.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
The President of the Council, Judge Michaela Sanin, resigned this fact.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
In order to reject the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had never suffered an asset disadvantage at any time.
The sports officials would have only charged expenses and the sports club, for which they were active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money, took out the debt - the liabilities in 2001 were about 600,000 shillings (about 44.000 euros).
"At that time we were faced with the situation: are we going to continue the club or are we going to lock it up?" said one of the defendants, in the office's bread profession, the chief accountant of the financial office.
He then decided with his colleague and co-defendant to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have launched money, put our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at the hearing.
It was agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, only no debt can be made.
In addition, in the event of a corresponding financial success, the payment of the expenditure compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991.
As a result, part of the expenses were paid out only years later, from the year 2003, when an increase had been in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed accounts appeared, the former obman explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed in detail to the association.
The association had not been interested in detail in the financial management, the answer was that it was only the freedom of debt that was important.
In 2011, when an official investigation of abuse of office began, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the club's account.
These were reserves, the defendants said.
This security account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
For a long time the respondent knew no answer to that.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the DA put it in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "compensation for damage."
Why damage compensation?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant said that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "You're all out of line with him."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
In addition, the official said that he had never received a cent's salary, he had only charged the mileage money and diets.
At diets he had charged the club 1,000 Euro per month, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an audit, in which everything had been considered to be correct, they said.
The second defendant had also received the mileage money.
All the corrections had been made in cash, and he had to go from his place of residence to the international market to the bank in Bleiburg, he said.
The main hearing will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard quits another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year staff reduction, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
The position of the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US Technology Group plans to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in its company customer sector.
This is intended to save costs of $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The three-year reduction of 55.000 jobs has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year, HP still employed some 302,000 people.
The Hewlett-Packard share went down 2.3 percent after the stock exchange.
The group from the California Palo Alto, which has become large with printers, is now divided: the computer and printing business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business will be listed on the stock exchange.
A again disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from company customers for its services have recently increased the world's second largest PC manufacturer according to Lenovo.
In the third quarter of July, sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
The proceeds thus decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to the change in the industry with a split and massive position.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only been late in responding to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and are doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for the total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflict: majority support for the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in the fighting in Iraq would be most likely to be rejected: 54% opposed, 35% agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24% are against intervention in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is opposed to 51 percent of the respondents, and 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.

As two years ago, the organizers of the car association VDA expect about 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: Interruption of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water launchers on the Serbian border against several hundred raised refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
A police line had formed behind it and a water launcher was standing behind the police.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials first used the pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was then disbanded.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while ago.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees were sitting together and suffering from difficulty in breathing.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of the decision on interest rates for the US central bank
The world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether for the first time in almost a decade interest rates are raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little over half, which was still in the opinion that the Fed would do so last week, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and that the interest rates will keep at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed put interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubid, head of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, $trillion are added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adapt to an increase, but the signs suggest that the chances against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Death Sentinel at Delta State University left apology letters
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a professor of geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10: 00 on Monday morning.
and said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the 911 staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but that "no one will bother," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, when police officers surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's performance."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and she was "destroyed."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb was awarded a doctorate from Delta State University, as his life-long status on the university's website indicates.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor is also supposed to have to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of possession of drugs.
I'm sure all of this is a tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is reconstructing the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large-scale restructuring of the company.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the world's around 1000 managers will cost the company's restructuring work.
The pilot union, however, has new negotiations.
Lufthansa is reconstructing its corporate structure and valuing Eurowings' low-cost daughter.
The aim of the reorientation was to make a profit contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline was to be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team for Chef Carsten Spohr.
With the new version, Spohr highlights the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group will be able to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 company has been complex.
The airlines registered under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three-quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective agreement with the Cockpit pilot association (VC), negotiations will be resumed after the court-run strike on this Thursday.
That's what the union told you.
The subject of the discussions is the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wanted to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible "in a year with a forecast record result."
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
The background is the "Wings" saving concept in addition to the pilot's transitional supply.
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the Eurowings Group's own low-cost line in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
= = = = PSV Eindhoven = = = = In the Manchester Champions League defeat, Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left foreign defender cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the changing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the imposition of an Elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Related to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the English defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked like it had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel very bad about it.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
I'm sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It's one thing that all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won't take you long to get to know it by heart.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, the environmental fable of Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far."
It's all nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book, instead gives a content of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but was completely unknown.
As if this was not yet suspicious enough: Cameron's text reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is devastated by the money-gifted, trees-raging, Thneed-knitting once-ler despite the protests of the naming Lorax, a cuddly, cuddly-bearded being "who speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
It is a difficult task to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but if you see the cadre England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out an away victory.
Alastair Cook's side is perhaps less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting set, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size on the test level, is an option for the attack.
The news is that Adam Lyth is leaving the England test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave out Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyse.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are oriented towards results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selection.
A long time ago, the course of Lyth would have been extended, but he was in control of his own fate.
If he's hoping to make another run for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not do so well, and I am not surprised; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test hit man gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away games.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a hit man I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must be given at least the same opportunities as the ones before him, but of course this depends on the team's position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen hit next to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowling and get four quicks, showed up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a baton can't beat there, and this left-handed man has already shown that he is a devil's kerl of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred runs and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up weirdo, and in my limited way of dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there are no large number of backup spiders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen youth.
He's going to learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made some smart additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a lot of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the changing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with the previous one.
Colly's team mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Days, Root received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easily in the heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain in zulauf if the economy was to be slapped by 2017
David Cameron's unfinished renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be more and more in trouble with every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn, the leader of Labour or the TUC, who was very much in discord about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply involved in various crises as the EU is and not always on their own fault, are filled with Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disturbing Treaty changes, which they do not usually want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it endangers social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outside UK inside the EU tent - "Let us not alone with France," says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's carefully informed Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the excessively long-standing, such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is looking forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, and Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg out to help the Selfie British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan non-helpful comments, entirely in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and what EU skeptics the oligarchy of the press barons is, but it was not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2-1.
You can easily remember Boris Johnson, the euro-ore opportunist who made a name for himself as a "EU-straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but noted that if you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of being at lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had put the principle on the unadopted EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs time to waste for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80's, a mistake back then and today.
It may take, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is in the process of development, and I would like to express it in a friendly way.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional bleach tendency and the wild areas of Tory's little Englishman can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary said "A Burn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and on the TV this week, when the Boy Scout fought in him, not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father on TV tried to be illoyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor was JC telling his colleagues and Members after all the reports at their meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the strudel of social media, a breeding site of paranoia and treason.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to think of Labour's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about Nato - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not launch a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction in the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start of Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticise Public Health England Report on E-Cigarettes
A state-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created by a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Policy Report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, some researchers have called into question the capacity of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people called to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to synthesise their opinions on the damage of various nicotine products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director had previously received from British American Tobacco Mitte (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarettes manufacturer, but did not add the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not delivered, but these include several well-known e-cigarettes champions, some of whom also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting was attended by the tobacco management of PHE.
The group's research work "confesses" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are a way to smoke for children or non-smokers were premature."
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had been responded to before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what is proof and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By providing clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in hard-hit times against the most popular shows of their rivals and from channels like BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC will or will launch programmes that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidised rivals," Johnson said to the Oberhaus-Kommunikation-Committee in the context of his study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program is financing, which could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own production.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this should be public-law television.
I do not think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was responsible for the hunt for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't measure quite the audience, but they do their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees," Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
They put it in a time window where no one ever wanted to see it.
On the radio fee, Johnson said to the committee, "I call on you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms of who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think, we all think that you get a great value for £150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky- and Channel 5-head David Elstein, who also told the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, form and entertain."
He said that little of BBC production is now officially classified as education - he said that it is 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should take an example on the public service television channels in Australia and Canada to change this in "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on TV, and enter alliances with commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction of the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses, which have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process, called sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fadenworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, such a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the changed creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent on an optical fibre to the desired place in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International anti-weapons show video.
Horrible killer drones!
Foot-to-foot-to-face-to-face-to-face-to-face-to-face-to-face-to-face-to-face-
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods, which cause painful pain, but do not leave a trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government's willingness to place weapons on repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains, which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you take the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR... Customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a 6 £pack of inbus keys, which is claimed to "gain access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London is not funny about this "vandalism."
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol's designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters salutes the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed over more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works for the non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms fair - through a space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they were trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic, shady company advertising, but "by blasting in with bright colors and animation it remains more adamant."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and a guarantee that torture devices are not being traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are spurring fantastic euphemistic products.

Eight golden rules for life in student homes
11 years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student's home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smile of those I have been angry with - and the numerous, long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to swat: people tell where you're from, whether and where you took a sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you "honestly Marmite don't love or hate, because in fact, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes got on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Let people.
People's rooms often turn into drinks, film-night venues and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people get dressed and move their underwear.
In relation to this: Don't remember to start with a relationship at the university
Introverted people receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space-stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life-long friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I have used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a student of sociability is exhausted - and send him a text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorms had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back mania, the knock at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
To offer home-made delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and will eventually perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to come to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the claw of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate, who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleep or work.
It is not just a matter of being a decent person, but of being one of the people sitting in the glass house in the truest sense of the proverb.
A girl in my hall asked her neighbors if they would mind putting it down a little bit, because it was 3: 00 in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even more loud music.
When they finally stopped at 5: 00, she kindly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she made her own music sound, closed her door and went to her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse were to move into the same dorm?
On the other hand, it would not be abruptly embarrassing if you thought of a roommate as your future spouse, getting on with her, getting back together and then seeing her every day and maybe seeing her move all the friends together?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to give your body a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone left his keys in his unclosed room, the border between an Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for it to become a boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson on safety - but never screw up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door and put your keys in a glass of water, which you put in the freezer - but do not tack your possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Roundhouses for refugees, lone parents, low-earners
The real estate company Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in the middle-Franconian Eckental for people who don't have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need residential space, but also the single mother and the low-income."
"I show how you can still build well and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly to create cheap housing: he is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gymnasts has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a large part.
In view of the flow of refugees, we will also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A completely banal, three-story terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It makes integration easier.
It's different when you put people in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a common room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
It's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I have carried out my project correctly under construction law.
It always makes it particularly complicated the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the place regulation.
It's creepy.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a terraced house need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is there no place for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their townhouse project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you exacerbate the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True is: We have had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments were built that hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message, and the normal people also need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single-parent mother or the low-paid.
I'll show you how to build well and well today.
That's the point.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first studied environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they receive an error message that tells you that the "software update has failed."
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to either wait until the storm goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by the extension of the update. It will also be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger, so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to be continued, as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to an end of the update.

You should also make sure that you have looked through our checklist of all things before your download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
In the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg only knows one foreign word: "Full Attack."
The second World Cup stressed before starting the decisive seven overseas races, "I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice-world champion from the title champion and two-time champion Hamilton on this Sunday before the follow-up in Singapore.
The British won seven of the previous 12 season races and also took on the Flutlicht Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
It is still unclear whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix.
For days a mist bell has been hanging over the city, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club, which was founded three months ago, "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen," has recorded another member in its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for a cure.
Gauselmann is the holder of the first class of the Federal Merit Cross and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that President Alfred Klein received.
This makes it possible to record chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search will also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" is seen as an expression of his connection with the Kurstadt.
Quartier's office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonististil centre have joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and have opened a new point of contact at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultation, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and counsellors will immediately receive information on questions such as care insurance or health and care insurance services.
For years, with our outpatient care service, we have found that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are many questions.
"Also, many of the benefits of the funds are not often used, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood," said the new home owner, Jutta Weigand, who, as a business manager, is also responsible for the Antonistig and the Bürgerspital and for the outpatient service "Amadeus."
In addition to the discussions, the new office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
It is therefore possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the senior centre and the Saludis are in an ideal way complementary.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and rehab.
"The senior care and care centre," described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is the demographic change of both managers.
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration ceremony, the Quartier's office also dedicated itself to the unification in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite you to be a regular social partner."
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a great contribution that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 am to 6 pm and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg v Würzburg Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third club Würzburg Kickers had not yet been set because of the renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was now set as the date.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website * Official website * Official website * Official website * Official website * Official website * Official website
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19: 00 at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will go over the stage, now we have planning security," said FCE-Teammanager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the card pre-sale that is now being started.
It's special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because flutlight games have a special appeal.
In the final 16 teams, Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 by winning in the district club 1. FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and at home against the regional club 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 Euro and will qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016 / 2017.

Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus is losing an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as it was called in the sending.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also worked as a teacher, writer and director of the Institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at a police officer
Ex-football player Tim Wiese has unnoticed in Bremen.
Föfbaler was once, now Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he has increased 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
He didn't get involved in intellectual matters.
Wiese was just cut his hair in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking room guard issue a parking ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Meadow then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
In the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still under examination," it says from the city of Bremen.
It was only then that it was decided whether or not to show the meadow.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest-typical climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the thriving of the marijuana plants.
For three days, the authorities of Panama have been ripping out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat in 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11.45 pm, three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft service station.
There were also three people on the premises of the gas station.
One of these men now yelled at the young man and hit him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a rupture of the nose and was bleeding very much from the nose.
When his two friends hastened and made a complaint to the racket, he left his victim at first.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The offender followed the group with a car to their home and went there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the racket and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim's face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, only a vague description of the perpetrator is available.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket was about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-and-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to report on the telephone number 06181 / 100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock houses and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felhausen.
This is also the case with velvet mayor Bernd Bormann, economic sponsor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: on October 1, Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock houses.
While Ursel is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be with his successor in the next few months with half a job.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was a sympathy at first sight when the rock houses met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training in the Verden Hospital and is also planning to enter the practice in the coming year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felgehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The couple liked the idea of operating their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up there, followed his medical studies in Hannover in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
In 2009, he was appointed as a leading emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and is volunteering for the DRK-Standat Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felhausen works as a home doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as a house doctor.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need one more room.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total grant of EUR 50000 as part of a funding programme from the district (EUR 25000) and the Samtgemeinde (EUR 12500) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will be continued," says Samtgemeindebürdemeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come into the practice of rock houses every quarter, in the North German average practice there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another house doctor's office.
A positive side effect of the practical acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felhausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had found herself, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit Müller's session continue to look mainly in familiar faces: take over the seven medical staff and the cleaning power from the rock houses.
With their farewell an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the medical practitioners have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel's rock houses remember, grumbling.
After a long time, she is feeling a little weary.
"But we still live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients many times," says the internist.
Your husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000-square-metre plot."
"So far, I've always been in the middle of gardening, and now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and is happy to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also going up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can make this "of course."
The care and security of people is at the forefront.
It is also clear, however, that "there is a need for clear signals," said the Minister.
People must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even through the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considering "Corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to have incoming refugees travel to Austria and Germany and that it might also establish corridors for the refugees.
However, this is not what the Minister of the Interior, Vesna Györkös Znidar, saw in Laibach.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable," but Slovenia would step up the monitoring of the border, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, however, Slovenia does not want to seal its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to pass the Tovarnik / Sid border crossing in the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles have been constantly arriving in the Croatian Tovarnik with new refugees.
It is mainly a matter of Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use.
In the coming days, his country will have about 4000 refugees, said Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday in agreement.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor do we want to," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on the road all night from the Macedonian border about 500 km away through Serbia.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue their journey to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could, in fact, lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route, Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which has already been predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Comprehensive opportunities for border control"
Croatia's Minister of the Interior, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive opportunities for border control."
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007, and the EU partners have since consistently provided the country with a good record in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
It is still unclear whether the remaining refugees want to move on to the Croatian border.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local sight in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area, there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, not yet open minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners in the border region was sent.
Exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of having been able to keep up with unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information received is intended to have been used to make insider transactions on the financial markets.
According to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were found in this way.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught," the SEC Communication states.
The trials against 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the US and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is a lot of operation around the Mannheim Parade Square.
People do their errands, sometimes fast steps, partly cozy and humbling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon at the Parade Square.
Stopping the city railways.
Pulsating, bright life with a beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large plates each with the heading "Before I want to die...."
The ecumenical hospice aid brought this action to the attention of its 20-year-old existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is available to the passersby as well as to the volunteer staff.
While some of the passers-by spontaneously take to the chalk and "say yes to my life," "can read," "with which campers go through the USA," "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long," others remain short, read, say sentences like "I am not yet that far" and then go on.
There is always little discussion about the action itself, about life, about how to deal with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point, can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diaconian work Mannheim, who together with the Caritas Association is the carrier of the ecumenical hospice aid.
Therefore, this public-sector action on the 20-year-old was good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to be publicly informed on the boards, and it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still subject to taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the subject through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in the help of the death.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought volunteers by a call, it immediately registered and was present at the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who are accompanied by the affected and family members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences made in the process.
"I see the life of another wait, think it's precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free and non-denominational.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of family members and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the death and mourning attendants.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now shown in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook for 2016 reduced
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supply giant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it is planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
According to a survey of factSet, analysts expected $10.84.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9% and will take effect on 4 January and despite higher increases for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November.
The company said that it still expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid income by considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below $2.44 per share, which predicted twelve analysts interviewed by Zack's investment research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zack expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has recorded a decline in international priority shipping, which has stalled sales in its unit of express shipping.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares decreased by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them at the end of the decorated two-storey meeting room is a wall of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to keep US employment and prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognised that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it, and it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the close-to-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that it is growing well, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid of increasing this volatility by increasing the interest rate on federal bonds - and even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they are watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsure of the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait and see, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists reduce the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy would maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the sentences at that time, "he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to reassure the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed to be doing well to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
In the spring and in the early summer, Yellen had said that, despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And even though inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labour market," said Ian Shepherd, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world shone together at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would reduce global growth.
The market has recovered a little this month, with the Dow now being almost 10% lower than the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have put on the reins in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US Central Bank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by the then head of the company Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a story of overactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its lead rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite a limited apparent impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability aspects only in the first place during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-fixing committee.
The recent turbulence is not coming near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are getting upset," said Poznan, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should go ahead with time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that is also sold to the general public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a one-stop-shop and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to walk through the corridors.
If the whole shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is close to the cash box and has various take-away options.
What is there: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallows, whole ducks, fish, cow's blood and bile, pig's colon, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping cars and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash register.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small help for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 lentils.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum-seekers' home on Dillinger Street.
There it helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German.
Of course, this is a very different class from a real school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying in a shocking way to tell women how important good nutrition is during breast-feeding. It does so with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy food.
Mother's milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative effect on the immune system.
Exemptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The Bernried municipal council approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof is allowed to become flat for solar systems.
The planning for the long-awaited gymnasium building on the Bernrieder sports grounds is progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
The panel had previously decided, among other things, on a request for an "exception" or "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form of roof construction.
A "saddle roof with non-centre first and roof overlay" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderful large south roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which, for energy reasons, is to be less than ten degrees, unlike in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "exemption" became necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" to the roof inclination - the Bernrieder municipal council is usually more restrictive in the case of exemption applications.
However, it is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with this," says Steigenberger.
The gymnasium building at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from the school and wide-range sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36-metre hall is now submitted to the Landrat for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, confirmed by the councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, the Supervisory Board will take a decision on this, and the Supervisory Board will meet next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were to be implemented, then all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The majority was to move to Schongau with Fischer and the more existing inner station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
The employees were informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play in the question of who is to follow the line, who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this means in any case a "appreciation" and a widening of the offer in the field of "internal medicine," says Jochner-White.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemaker and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is on the inner station specialized in gastroenterological diseases.
As a transitional measure for the next two years, Fischer is to run both houses with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, until next year the former hospital of the squadron, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
To date, the district had planned this for 2018, when the current rehabilitation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landrat Jochner-Weiß, who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board, met with rumours that the house, which is owned by the Federal Government, will be used as a home for asylum-seekers in the future.
"I exclude that." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there were several considerations.
At present there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said Fischer about the quasi move to the Lech, which had been taken up by the employees "positive and very understanding."
There was no real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongau's colleagues to take over the position of medical director.
The hospital of Peißenberg (once 100 beds) has been threatened with closure over the past decades, and departments have been closed, for example, surgery and obstetrics.
The hand-balers of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are required this evening (8: 15 p.m.) at the Bergische HC.
The Bundesliga's table leader is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be overhasty.
In the last season, the BHC had a painful defeat and had something to do.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Abernten on a corn field near Pratau (Wittenberg district), several hunters were in operation, as the police reported.
After a shooting, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
At first it was unclear how exactly the accident could happen.
The police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crimes
A suspect led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In an interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young people and throwing their body in a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found on Tuesday night in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as the prosecutor and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who, according to the facts, confessed and the investigators led to the site of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the eve of a visit to a autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the group of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was finally a suspicion of a crime against the 20-year-old.
The alleged offender then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the prisoner admitted in the police interrogation that he had killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the channel.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the judge on Wednesday, and the investigators put him to death.
The further investigation is to provide information on the near circumstances of the action.
Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for a affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the coming refugees and job-seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Association Alliance "Social Housing."
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be finished in Germany.
This is a lack of 140,000 apartments.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in a first-time reception accommodation.
Many then enter the housing market and line into the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, in the last year less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also shows significant failures in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
At present, some 750,000 housing units in the conurbations were missing, Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many workers therefore lived in large cities in need of WG rooms.
Young adults stayed in the "Hotel Mama" involuntarily longer because of the slutty in the apartment market.
In the large cities, the number of square metres per head had fallen for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a new start.
The aim is to restore new incentives to social housing.
In this way, the basic employment tax could be waived and the real estate tax on assisted housing could be suspended for a limited period.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation possibilities are needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation at the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and communities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been made available on Monday night, with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees are free: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no more transit, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will be able to pass through Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary we will organize a corridor," said the Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left for Croatia to go from there to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, the Croatian TV station RTL reports.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
In addition, new laws that came into force on the same day make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are here, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU's neighbouring country Croatia in the morning.
Most of the media reports have come from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to Sid by bus as well as by taxi.
As soon as they arrived, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip has other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mines are now to quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the border is closed, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 attacked people.
Just before the end of the gate on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage to the border fence as a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated.
The convicted are in danger of being arrested for up to five years and of being deported from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition of the country.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stayed there.
In practice, however, no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary.
In the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers will be deported there.
In front of the "Transitabone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees were gathered.
In Röszke workers began to clean it up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the edge of the road in the past few weeks.
Blocknets have been dismantled and one of the host camps in the border place has been rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this change.
After the border between Serbia and Hungary is closed, Austria is only able to reach a few refugees.
The country has also increased its border controls.
However, some 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government data.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instructions of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor went "Stranded" across the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent with travel cases," said Wernnein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream, it was the end for them in Wernstein, "said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffen the displaced together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the near Passau.
Before that, we have first charmed the unexpected guests with snack and drinks.
We just said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"This was a matter of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man could not be taken to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased about this," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try, after the short-term announcement, that the train was stopped to Germany, but still across the border.
The regional train was left in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The Brückenfest was connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, a two-bridge race on the day before sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the camp of Röszke to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has put the position of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of National Socialism in a highly official and public way.
The suffering of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to say that the "promised land" they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for protection seekers in the face of the ongoing flows of refugees and the coming winter.
And it will be even greater - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-resistant quarters
Konrad has all his hands full with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center of Traiskirchen has already been under control by Konrad.
"We no longer have the homeless in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
The housing of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday had also taken place without a big vortex, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance."
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis-like situation."
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters in the year 2000.
In order to meet the number, there will have to be 35,000 more accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without a floor," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the country's captains.
They would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandate supports Konrad.
Tomorrow, there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help as we do."
On the platform, private individuals can offer accommodation easily.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high."
In emergency times, it could not be that the quartier must maintain a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad is more successful in housing.
I am an older man who is not easily told to face the untruth.
It was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not give the Republic any costs, as they themselves said.
They want to increase their staff to three to four.
The own quartersearch has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephen Square as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better distribution
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open up urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips-arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees.
This was not necessary at the moment, as the people concerned could currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further sites will be tested for their suitability for the emergency.
The head of the city is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Boundaries are not sealed"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, state captain Josef Pühringer (VP) has added the further action on the question of refugees.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed down.
It was still possible to travel refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany.
However, the relevant border controls are now in place.
For the time being, there will be no special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the issue of refugees.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the German action.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S & T has moved in and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and later acquiring them.
From the very beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next runtastic is only a matter of time."
A total of 1.7 million euros were invested in the site by S & T, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased to S & T and Techcenter for 60 years by Linz AG.
30 per cent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building is already rented, for a further 40 per cent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opened second business in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project in the Daubenmarkt-Arkade in a short time: After all, she has now received an increase in the form of another business location.
In the Furla-Shop opposite the business in which she sells, among other things, bags, bags, shoes and clothing of various manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallet are to be have from 75 Euro.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Before that, it was rebuilt for several weeks.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about whether to open another shop," says Breit.
The key to the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also involved in the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put in the cradle by her mother.
I feel the most good when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women can't answer with the last certainty when they see a beautiful handbag.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag of each outfit is worth it.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called lenders.
This property is also linked to the billionaire who wants to become the President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he is xenophobic, he is talking about journalists, or he is revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy, the candidate for the US President's Office is making the election campaign strong.
And cut it off well.
This is also registered in the Pfalzian Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the property millionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the haircut is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-inhabitants-place is more than a few corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstädter Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädter has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts, including the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the family's performance, Trump tends to think that "a little bit of a big mouth," Wendel says.
By chance, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the area is "The Brulljesmacher" - to high German: the Anchor, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the lads.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a store for gold graves in the United States.
The real estate company was the foundation stone of the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of Tragik: their desire to return to their home country in the long term failed on the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not record Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Pfalzian History and Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared a film start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant."
This is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken abruptly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"The way he pops, it's not so nice," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trumps ("The Granny was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winegrower sees the American rather distant, "he is always so uptight."
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm, like some Kallstadter, mentions that a descendant of the Heinz family, during a visit, donated something for the church organs, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
You would find it better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge of the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And, "The grapes will be ripe without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12 000 cinema-goers, and in the US the interest is also awakened.
The upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf."
From the hands of the Vice-President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Bergsteigerdörfer."
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for the award of the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum population of 2500.
At least one fifth of its area shall be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite attempts by Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hasten to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but it has not provided any major shifts in the reviews for today.
The Nine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderator David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to play any role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 spectators in the five capitals, compared to today's 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators at 314,000 today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for the check!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million spectators and slightly beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (5: 00 to 5: 30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, showed an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (5: 30 am to 6: 00 pm) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half-hour, 720,000.
Hot-Seat average 620,000.
The fall in the second evening of The Chase Australia's quotas will be positive for Nine that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5: 30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that did not make it to the McGuire show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly seen who wins The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was covered in the greatest secrecy.
And neither of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows the day before three of them become two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have been lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should receive Wood's last rose?," their answers could become a gambler who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay the best partner for Wood, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," said Jeavons Fellows.
"Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreserved for him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday, 7: 30.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some of the coaches would have banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a lash as the Aussie Rugby League convert did in his first Punt return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a punt return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
= = = After the game = = = In the end, the game was played in the first round of the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his faked catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patzt at a punt that was restored in the first quarter of the game by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his NFL debut.
After the Fumble, Hayne left the field and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"This was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a pass at his own in-Goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's most rich man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with weapons.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company Yukos seized and his democratic efforts were stopped.
The Free Voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn break in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis in Bayern's schools, if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse," said Aewanger.
"Otherwise we will get discards in the Bavarian education system."
The Free Voter Country Group will meet in the Lower Franconian Commune until Friday.
In fact, very different main issues were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlay the clash," said Aivanger.
Aivanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as was the case during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"This is no longer the case, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aivanger also asked for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum actions: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aivanger.
The head of the FW criticised the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need uniform standards of the federal states throughout the country."
"Bavaria is moving, others are not."
"We need to be more effective."
But the country's policy in the city of Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Kultusminister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched the pilot experiment "Middle-level plus" at 47 gymnasia, in which an extension of the middle-level gymnasia is tested from three to four years - as a result it will take nine years to complete the course.
But that's not going far enough.
"The subject of G9 must be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all the schools that want to do so.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
More firm Wall Street helps Dax on the jumps
The German stock market has closed with profits after a long-distance, unoriented and nervous trading process.
It was only in the afternoon that a featherer start of the US stock exchanges provided a clear direction, which ultimately transported the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax won 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
The technology-consuming TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the leading index of the euro area was up by 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
The London and Paris trading venues also recorded solid profits.
In the United States, the Dow Jones index last recorded around 1 percent in the plus.
Many stock exchanges expect markets to be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the big fall on the futures on this Friday.
In the meantime, the discussion about the loads from the nuclear exit has pushed the shares of RWE to a record deep and also left deep traces at Eon.
According to "Spiegel" the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in reserves.
The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by another 3.22 percent at the Dax top.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" was published from the weekend.
As a result, investors currently paid too little attention to the German chipbauer.
Investment in future-rich wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.

The dollar thus cost EUR 0.8846 (0.8875).
4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets into a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before it used rubber bullets.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to be able to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th century.
The four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been central for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be built again.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters.
A mixture of trade, business and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a land of about 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth centre.
The preparations for this are under way.
It is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade, business and housing.
You wait for appropriate offers, it is said by the city.
What investor is eligible is not yet clear.
As a result, no contracts had yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the land on the Ringstraße / Corner Großstraße and had the building torn down a few months ago.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday house settlement at the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
The investor first presented public plans for the project.
A number of people are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, greeted, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday house settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested person, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau," presented his plans to the Emder Council's City Development Committee for the first time in public on Monday evening.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, who accused the investor and the administration of secret crime, Ralf Behrends from the system-construction management went into the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all the questions," he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it was good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
The project, which is worth some EUR 10 to 12 million, has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction were produced by the strong reactions among the boatowners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, the owner of the sea-buds and a member of the board of directors at the interest of the Anläger, Pro Hieve, is complaining: "This is going to be a huge blow that overcomes all the other buildings."
He also fears, like many other project critics, that the planned size of the plant would increase the traffic significantly: "There must be whole bus loads to be expected," says Schulz.
However, what is happening on the very one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"We must have a coherent approach first," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Two-year-old at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to young people with its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Two-born are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it is said of the zoo.
The sex of the newly born gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian has kept them close to the body.
At first the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center predicted on Tuesday a wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, about in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60% potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double-donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL. O) announced a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they flee countries torn and impoverished by war.
Google has an unusual personal approach in announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"A lot of dark train and bus rides were part of our journey, as were hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / refugee run to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations have been shown to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-in-fat with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tubing - to medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same as with 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% of them completely and 28% of them partially dissociated.
In the medically treated group, compared with diabetes, the total loss of diabetes was only one percent and in some cases only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol controls were generally better in the 'surgical' group, the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas-rectomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved major decreases in the BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%), and was more likely to be fully overcome (46.9% vs 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years in obese people undergoing an obesity operation, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any advantage for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to reverse. "
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is an issue that is now increasingly being taken into account in the Belletrics: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets again after years the swarm of her youth, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recent novel "Actually we are not like this" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel is likely to be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker readers, as it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her home town.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not welcome all the refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis was in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for the end of the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed in the circumstances before the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis was admirable, but it was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to address the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, such as a real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he said.
In the end, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's action after the September 11 terrorist attack and found that the US's violent reaction led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children over the last 4 years
Poison control centres in the United States report an almost 400% increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of hand-held infections in children under the age of 12 reporting toxic control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to go to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutant in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing oral water to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child does not think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand-disinfectants) are the ones that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrances, which are very attractive for children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in the case of small children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison call center in the hospital of the University of Kansas, the channel Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within the reach of children, and when children get there, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of a strawberry-fragrant hand-infectant in school, was taken to an emergency room.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah lured her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors were monitoring them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing of hand-held agents containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health care staff suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the state of New York planned to poison their "mean" teacher by laying out antibacterial products around the classroom, "it reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand-taking agents and banished them from her room.
The police considered the plan to be a "scoundrel" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was easily injured in an on-the-road accident in the cross-section between Nordring and Auf Herden.

As a result, he took his truck to the rear of an audis and pushed this vehicle on a Ford Fiesta.
In the case of the vehicles involved in the accident, some 10 000 euros were damaged, the police reported.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.

The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said, "In the Netherlands, they no longer show highlights of the Celtic Games and why?"
It's because the Rangers are not here.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it is not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, swears Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat of 10 men from Aberdeen followed, who now have a five-point lead at the top of the table.
But Deila said, "Celtic had a bad time before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Now, standing together is so important.
Warburton careful with January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was pitting on several January transfers, Rangers-boss Mark Warburton is careful about signing new arrivals and insists that he does not want to disturb the unit of the Ibrox cadre.
The ex-boss of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate into what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice

McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything in poker games or leagues that have not won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is increasing.
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was above that of the UK of 5.5%, as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5%.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.

Why I will be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man get killed.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I will be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was first made in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
The one who is selected will observe it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story how he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for this.
What you're gonna get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after moist police chase persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Caving Vale police officer remained dry when he persuaded the man of the Caving River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, only a few meters away from a police officer who "tried to persuade him to return to the shore gently."
The police of Canning Vale was called to a house-breaking incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water and he said," I'm not coming out, come and get me, "said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to wet his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiated."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
The team's football player Ben Cousin offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewart of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tube sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it "to look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Before, Moody had blown the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man I'm going to name when I'm asked to, and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information on what I do within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly take on their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are.
Is that supposed to make me think it's personal?
Did the RVL act cowardly and perhaps make people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and break me out, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will make them think about it now.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's frustration levels have been built up with the long-lasting cobalt examination at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my employees misplaced mud on the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, which was the case.
But it also had it on the day of the race.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the pack on the race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after a driver's escape
The police arrested a man this weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with a helicopter, after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police in Sheppard turned up.
He is expected to be charged with driver escape and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is in a stable state.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the tackling of his players an "agenda setting" of two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosster's coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the Storm player "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a little covered note about the Storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "sample" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the wrestling.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team is positive because it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This is coming up again and again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24-2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has made the trend turn for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is therefore probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this always shows up this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her game was, "said Bellamy.
I remember in 2010, St George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he's not gonna take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I'm building more trust because they say these things, because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
They probably didn't think about us six weeks ago when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday night in the pre-final at AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning.
Serbier with $200,000 deposit after drug charge
A man who may be in danger of a life sentence for his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released for a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and started in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life-long penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release.
"After reading the affidavit of the two people, it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released for bail, subject to the conditions that he will pass his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police every day and keep to a curfew of 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Führer's house is torn apart
A truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night in a three-truck accident on the 5 motorway near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three involved trucks had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's cab was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 am.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure pedophile to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when he was asleep, logging into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing news and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms for the search for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "pretended to be a cop to scare them."
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to frightening people.
He admitted that the search on the computer was done by him, but said it was because he wanted to claim to be a cop to scare pedophile.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the trembling and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty, in the sense of the indictment, of taking indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, of violating the conditions on 25 January of this year and not being published in court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" can be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Schlüuser evade on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers let people more and more at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
out on the Austrian side, said a spokesman of the federal police.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and diaphragm.
There they are received by federal police and forwarded for registration.
According to the Federal Police data at the Munich Central Station, there were again significantly more refugees in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8: 00 a.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the capital, said a speaker in the morning.
After the re-introduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, the city was reached on Tuesday 1759 refugees.
Stuttgart: Ejectors of tropical tower "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm in the south-west of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced.
The strong low is the end of the tropical storm "Henry," which in the last few days had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, it is still possible to expect gusts from 60 to 90 km by Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance.
On Friday the sun can be seen again longer.
The mass does it: Every two years the car manufacturers on the IAA show their new products.
In 2015, the main movement is the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: In August alone, this segment accounted for about 28.1 percent of new registrations, according to the German Federal Motor Transport Office (KBA).
This is also reflected on the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the largest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be standing at the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel offers an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
The Hessen also offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp, which include for the first time three-cylinder petrol.
Unlike the most important VW Golf and Ford Focus competitors, the Opel Astra is only available as a fifth-tier.
The second variant will be the "Kombi" in the spring, which can be seen on the IAA.
And what is going on next to the Astra on the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a fifth-door in a conventional and an emphasized sporty GT version.
He comes into the trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combo.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is very new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan-Schleiber wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the brand's design line.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
But there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno is also new in the segment, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to the manufacturer's specifications.
The sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but all around it is the compact model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
In the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-Läger made a hand at the front: here the grille was redrawn and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and Apple's CarPlay was first integrated.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI have joined the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of human rights
The Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex-prisoner of the Tegel prison, who was in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the people concerned can hope for money even if they were only locked in the too narrow rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
This was a success for an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was in a single cell with about five square meters of ground between June and November 2009 at the Berlin-Tegel Justice Centre; the toilet was not separated from the area.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now on the loose again, had been moved to a larger cell.
His arrest claim for the unworthy conditions of arrest against the Land of Berlin failed.
But the constitutional judges removed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, the period in question was only a few days' imprisonment for the compensation, there was a right to compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, "a clash of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared."
The court must now clarify the amount of the money compensation.
The constitutional judges have often in the past strengthened the rights of prisoners.
So they only gave a prisoner compensation in April because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 a decent accommodation.
The then plaintiff was in a cell of the same kind as in the Karlsruhe case every day for three months between 15 and 21 hours.
The Berlin prisons have also been on the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, and even fighting is said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not occupied due to a lack of young people, 19 are to be lost in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is the case with Germany?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to receive one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do it and we can do it."
The following overview shows what is to be done in Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350,000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is being built (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing, however, is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: every year, 60000 to 80000 social housing is out of the rental price, and these particularly favourable apartments will also be used by refugees.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from the current 518 million to a billion euros.
From the Pestel Institute's point of view, this is far too little: 80 000 social housing per year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
The Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research estimates that 55% of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started, says Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to the appreciation of the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migrant researcher Dietrich Thänhardt.
In Germany, according to Thänhardt, there has been a political change: from the ban on the work of refugees to the recognition of work.
While in the past there was a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years old, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement which restricted asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, the majority of the people, even because of the lack of skilled workers, have taken the view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge.
There is not yet sufficient provision of general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
The development of networks is therefore, in the view of Thänhardt, the Königsweg to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
If the need for female educators is increasing strongly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for the class in welcome classes.
They are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration.
The German Student Foundation estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal country forbids asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception to date was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Student-willing refugees could be made easier to access the university.
For refugees with a residence permit or payment will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Services Act when they start their studies.
In principle, the latter do not get a bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of the persons entitled to a bafög.
The patient refugees had so far had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this range will be reduced to 15 months.
This funding gap must also be closed, however, calls for Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Foundation.
The students should get bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that professionally takes care of the newcomers.
The rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact points and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to give it certain control opportunities.
This also includes the willingness to take a hefty approach to religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeit their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on Bayrische Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more an issue for the whole of society than it is today.
This will also have to change the majority of society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a short decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
The same opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for and what international agreements, such as the German Anti-Racism Convention, require, in the coming years, a reality if the country is to remain peaceful and make use of its new citizens' opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany was able to provide medical care to the expected refugees, says doctor president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man- power and capacity are concerned, we can do it," he said to the day level.
However, additional money had to be put into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands to hand out health cards to all arrivals at the time of registration.
Services provided could later be settled with the Länder.
And in the long term, it was highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited list of services provided by the Asylum Services Act.
Otherwise, the most important thing is to create the language barriers for the doctors.
In the past, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated that migrants have been less informed about their diseases than other patients.
It is not only in hospitals, but also in medical practice that interpreting costs have to be taken over, she demands.
However, many refugees would have been helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency camps.
And with another diagnostic look.
There were, for example, much more untreated disabilities among refugee children, and the young people were concerned with HIV education.
However, German doctors would be clear about their training with some of the other disease pictures, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to see." And as far as the medical shortage is concerned, the refugees may even be able to see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and a number of refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take further tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
In particular, refugee children are vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with difficulty in breathing, dizziness, heart rate and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong terrifying and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz said.
However, so far only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most of the staff or doctors who are not trained for mental diseases would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misassessments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion," the Circus Probst uses the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to the manege on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior boss.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current Manegen production.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
So the gift for the Enjoying is in the family's blood.
"It is important to us to take people away from their daily riot and take them to a completely different world for two hours," says the 27-year-old junior director.
"Manegencocktail with world-city flair," so Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience into its spell with fun and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films it wants to record the Cuban duo more easily.
Easiness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon salts, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with a sense of fingertips and articulation.
Balancing with the unicycle on a bullet?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals are part of our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Maladministration in the attitude of circus animals is only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not well, we are not well."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
The "four-legged artists," as they are called lovingly, will be read from the eyes as far as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to be in the guild.
So the first commandment is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is especially proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Ponyheng and a Zebrastute.
The two animals lived together for eight years in a compound and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best and are with all our heart in it."
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances every day from September 17 to 20 at 5: 00 and 8: 00.
The program starts on Sunday at 11: 00 and 4: 00.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives false speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained unhurt, but the video of the case quickly spread through the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also clouded by claims by opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and that they were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with calls.
Last month they had dug him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones, which they warned against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said to journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity is ending in Parliament and, as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in the context of the company's restructuring and savings efforts.
HP will later be divided into two listed companies this year and the computer and printer business will be separated from its fast-growing company hardware and service activities.
The expected job reduction leads to a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard-Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP-Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual sales and "will be focused on the provision of unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for companies," said a company statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Artea says that team mates must be behind the injured Jack Wilsher in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilsher that it was only September and, if his rehabilitation is on schedule, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship will be uncertain next summer.
The big shame in this current problem is that Wilsher had finished the last season after a separate ankle injury and then found his old swing back during the previous season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a major matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilsher since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs that had the most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get over this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger is setting up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Artea are expected to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to move on through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, with 3.2 measured on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League surrender against Monaco and remains driven by the far-off hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is huge," Wenger said.
It's never worked for Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.

FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicidal rates among young men on a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the patient had a sufficient percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyous and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extractive values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much more profound effect on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently said, money really can't buy luck.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by its work, but by its personality, which was shining through the interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the desire of Ross for Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often hold back to completely exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone soul care told me, "my listening role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old speech "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more long-term response mechanisms.
It clearly presents the little moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned setting to celebrate the day, why don't you take your friends to the Central Perk for a drink.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move on to Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player, who launched the French master, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a head-ball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they not only aim to qualify for the KO-rounds, but to improve on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahim's missed chances before the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrative career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2: 0, to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect in the course of the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we did not score one or two more goals. "
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which on the weekend could hold a 2-2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was stunned by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wingstorm was called the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he suggested why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he passed by Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far by Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some mispassports and bad financial statements, not least by Ibrahimovic, who patched in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and was then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the relaunch.
Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahim-himovic, who turned Di Maria into a shooting shot, which was passed by the post by Wiland in the 52nd minute...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer thus achieved his sixth Saisontor, after Ibrahim had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was recognized as a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was last December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualification games are not enough. "
Hats off from Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through share sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by falling raw material prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt eradication plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is fighting with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is pressing demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of reference rights brought a rapid increase in the share price of the trade to the top of the London stock exchange on the early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to repay around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other raw material prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest girl is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, takes place on 25 September and returns President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state diner this evening, after the two leaders had bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to deal constructively with areas of disagreement," adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and its increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sad Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously close to the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who then played for Barcelona.
Eight Spanish champions, three Cup winners, four Champions League winners, two Club World Champions, two European Champions, one World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, he left Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sad Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already in front of the 2008 EM before the farewell from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça was going to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing," he says.
And that was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
The change was not made.
And the decisive man for it today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has signed Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I would not change, that he could not imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008 / 2009 season would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-final of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the red (4: 0, 1: 1) and at the end celebrated the King's Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confronted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night of HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives, in relation to a black protagonist in the selected script of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it with the film and not with the show," said Damon.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the actor's comments of The Martian were consolidated.
Damon and Brown joined Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker who's being beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People was working for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the film's direct rights; Damon replied that their director "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's so well that it hurts."
The Tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement had a country-wide impact and urged legislators and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against Colored Stage.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement, in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The network Black Lives Matter is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogues invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first champion
Professional sports climber and operating aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season, two men, Caldiero and Cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The final task was to climb a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-won victory, still in shock over the win of the Great Prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, does not receive any prize money.
Under the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it will be the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's got any grudge about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I were to be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had switched the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday they played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the target field.
The Twins lost a chance to get up in a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and made three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end very much this year," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and so I want to go into the game in a very focused way.
The designed tiger-hit Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the wood well," said Ausus.
He looked good at the (hit training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left-hand line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a blot, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed over the wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated Rookie-hit man Miguel Sano, who took a two-run from the right-hand man Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading in the Major League's 27th time this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall made an RBI double against the close of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
The right-handed man, however, kicked out Sano at three pitchs for his fifth save.

The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injury list before the game after having missed for more than a month because of a back suffering.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the Leadoff-Batter in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought in Victor Martinez, who made a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 series of success with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, made another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right job.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, did not score any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever right-handed A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
REMARKS: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to an injury to the throwing shoulder.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injury list since mid-August, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 because of a disintegration in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in it will then be accommodated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the first-time government president, Gießen, 7500 people have arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective vision."
Four years ago, one was glad that the Cup of a military participation in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict ends up in front of our doorstep," he said on the German radio.
The former German Ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television station ORF that no one is now being sent back to Hungary.
Germany had not sent any refugees back to Austria either.
"No, it's so agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement that would allow Germany to start a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
Over the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU Home Affairs Ministers want to take a new start at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September) for the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee demand in Germany, the Federal Government wants to provide more support to the countries in the initial reception and distribution of the people.
The Federation will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those who need protection would also get it.
But those who do not have a chance to stay could not stay in Germany either.
This view had been strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort of strength."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route.
In the night of Tuesday, Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also seal the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country, unlike Serbia, is part of the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent tugs from looking for alternative routes over Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, in the meantime, the eyewitness reports indicate that thousands of other migrants are on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the ice tank of the Saturn moon Enceladus, a global ocean swam.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe "Cassini."
According to this, the moon is easily staggering around the ring planet on its path.
This tumel movement is only small, but still too large for a permanent celestial body, it is said in a message from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US state of New York) from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the technical journal "Icarus."
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturn moon, which spun water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers then closed.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up for about a month on the offensive actor Valdet Rama.
An investigation had revealed an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to the Munich lion, the diagnosis means "four weeks of forced break."
"It's hard for us, Rama is a great loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said Sports Director Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a uncompromising professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties first presented a defensivman.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently had "the opportunity to prove its ability."
Torhunter Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday the Austrian national player is to enter the running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0: 3) in a violent collision on the head.
In contrast to the first fears, however, he remained without a serious blasphemy.
No diet fruit - mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But he who wants to take care of his slender line is often rather discouraged from them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: in them are B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Above all, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangos should not be too soft or too strong and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.
A mango, however, also gives a special touch to savoury dishes.
It reduces the slightly bitter taste of some foliage salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US package service UPS again provides up to 95000 support for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are sought.
In the past year, UPS had already increased its staff for the holiday season by 95000 support.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early arrangements for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First the moonstorm, then the striking cold front
The next night, in the valleys of the Alpennord side of the Föhn, breaks through, as Meteoschweiz reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and the night to Thursday, the hair-dryer blows partly with storm strength through the hair-teller.
After the moaning on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, which brings strong rain, wind buds and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Islands in a strong southwestern current.
On the Alpennord side the Föhn breaks through the valleys on the night of Wednesday.
As a result, the hair-dryer blows to Thursday morning in the frogs with gusts from 60 to 100 km / h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km / h.
The Föhn can reach to the adjacent middle and on the mountains even Orcan Böen of over 120 km / h are possible.
While on Wednesday stormy hair-dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees in the north, the humidity on the Alpensüdhang begins to stow.
This is where rain starts, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, in the next 48 hours, south of the Alps will have to be expected to have some over 100 litres of rain per square metre, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair-dryer is running out of air, and a cold front will then roll over Switzerland with strong, partly warmed rain from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshens up strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go down significantly.
The following days will be present in the north in autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it will be more sunny and warmer in the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of the city president Ignazio Marino, a so far unnamed place in the park on the Oppio hill was christened on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as a "German Theologist of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Coliseum.
The name was requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes for centuries could often only live their faith in secret as a minority.
With the square, it became symbolically visible that their tradition of the Christian faith was welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustine monk for a few months in Rome around the turn of the year 1510 / 11.
He saw the city as a lost scapegoat.
In the view of historians, his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Church of the West with his theses against the trade in parades.
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
The 75-year-old has received his "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms - but this is by no means equivalent to "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite dark.
About three years ago, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many themes of the "Book of All Books."
These are cycles that are devoted to topics such as the way of the cross, plagues, commandments or our fatherland.
With this he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of painting, has dealt with the respective passages of the Bible.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and so "translated" into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and a set of the artist who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the particular situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old equally allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the cause of the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Order of Herrnhuter.
"There the education was already done with the cane," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out so that I may be able to make up with the Lord Father again."
His second concern was to give more importance to art in a fast-paced period of time: "The perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed there.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "fall" into the pictures, let them work on them, discover and feel the strength they have: "The image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible at the Otmar Alt Foundation, "always" to have been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Alt had not taken care to fully grasp the Bible, but had chosen the important, even mysterious topics for him.
"This was not an eye-level cooperation," Altepost says: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains." A picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Old's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX-Bahn near
Plans made, found place, company commissioned, ground hills modelled for a round course: a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn it was already over.
Fates in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So the hills are down, new place is looking for - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
The approval will be received in October, the First Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now announce to the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope that the visible will happen this year," she said.
The work of the former indoor pool was to be started without a "further memorial break."
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019, and the Bundesliga is setting a clear mark on the weekend.
Football is responding to the growing situation in Germany and is providing policy help to address the problems ahead.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say it's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be of interest to each and every one of us to get this subject under control," said DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth.
"I will be in the chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Mrs Özoğuz and the chancellor."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and will help.
But the decisive course must be the policy.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach on the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some federal players also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will be printed on the left-hand jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes), "We help - # return welcome."
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's head of sports Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project "of course."
"The refugee drama is for everyone, no one can look away."
"We can, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbelievably," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale for the EM-Qualification game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large joint work of German football."
The fact that all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their places is great.
It's just as great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1: 0 for a welcome" we have spent is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the whole amount for 2015," reported Nielsbach.
Reports: SAP head of the board loses an eye in the event of an accident
The head of the board of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has, according to several reports, lost the left eye by a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs of his brother's house in the USA, he fell on a water glass, which he had carried in his left hand, reported the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled out, had passed out, then dragged himself out on the street - that's what he told us last week," quoted the "WiWo" co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully operational."
In an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday issue), McDermott announced that he would come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ."
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
He said it was important to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said, "This can happen to everyone."
"It's important to get back up when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of battle...
Magnussen tweeted a photo and said he had suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not eligible as a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button on the weekend as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down.
The national player will also be missing from the table leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 am / Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot use him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday."
In view of the high strain on his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal 11 on the Reus position.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Chief Keeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller would be used in all the Europe League games in the future.
= = References = = = = External links = = * Official website
The research statement by fellow player Reus that the goal for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal is to make it clear to midfielder Julian Weigl: "Marco is not so wrong with this."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robot cars: Government wants to lead Germany
Germany is supposed to be a technological pioneer in the change of the car, according to the will of the German Government.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday, Dobrindt spoke of a "new age of mobility" in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair.
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide less congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track on the 9 motorway in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
In order to "do not impose any additional liability risks on the driver," the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments."
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permitted speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 km per hour.
The German Government is also committed to amending the Vienna Convention, which has so far only provided for people as drivers.
In the case of automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, and the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in a second.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
However, no-one on public roads was "to be expected long after 2020."
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital network of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said the SPD traffic policy-maker Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
But the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey of the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra test organisation, presented on Wednesday, shows that only eight percent of Germans believe that car-driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, 31 percent don't believe in it at all.
In France, 21 per cent of the respondents expect cars to travel autonomously until 2025, and in the USA 33 per cent.
In any case, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to take control of all roads throughout the journey.
On the highway this could be seen in the running traffic at least 15 per cent, in the traffic jam 45 per cent.
Well, every fourth would not give the car control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis EM
According to the current stand, the Düsseldorf player wants to be a single player in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said Federal Trainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsor appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite," said individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who led the set list in Yekaterinburg, also referred to the 2013 EM in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was also missing, and we have become European champions."
"We should be guided by this," said the World Tranglist-Fifth.
The English national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis of the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger pointed to a breaking of the rail.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant Terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax-figures-crusel cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look frightening human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the Enfant Terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, it's real now," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which is to be seen from September 18 in the Art Hall of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is a good thing that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude to a show about his person.
He was actually against it because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already made a stop in the Canadian Montreal and Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Art Hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hard-to-see work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever completing any training.
The show is not built in chronological terms, but it is an excellent choreographed total work for which a lot of effort has been done: to prepare the dolls, for example, a stylist was dedicated.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been carted to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special guy: a leather-pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, tiresome fashionable walking attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
His parents wouldn't have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later I bought them, of course.
For his first fashion show he could not pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were made in large quantities for customers who, for example, they processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Modelspitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a greater role, then was replaced by the home-made industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style pox, is an increasing job potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modelspitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and Embroidery together with nine other companies.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of the turnover has been lost.
There are almost no more private and wholesale trade.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
The mass goods are now produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are almost exclusively distributed through chains.
In addition, exports are weak, currently to Russia and the US.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the embroidery pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been carrying a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch office of the West Saxon University of Applied Arts Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from Asia, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
A field of tension is created between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which must above all think economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historical snowball tip.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The Plauener goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauss was inspired by this: "Before that, I could not do anything with traditional Plauener Spitze."
Now she's using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in plauen and surrounding areas and who want a piece of memory.
With this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen Spitze.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film
I don't want to touch legends, but Disney still dares to get a new movie from his classic "Mary Poppins."
According to "Entertainment Weekly," this is not about a new film, but about a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experience of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Those who play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open up the economy to the world
The economy must be more open to the outside world in order to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-ups strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
To promote start-ups and to promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth, said Xi.
The Management Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of rules on market access, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE) to raise private capital, and the overhaul of the local reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up that identifies the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a state-of-the-art business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up government-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predators
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators, thus giving consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has an EU working paper on this subject, strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons."
However, large predators are already so heavily exposed to mercury that, on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50% of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
In return for this easing, Foodwatch says that the EU is to increase the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this a "trick," because smaller cemetfish, such as carp, are usually so low that they meet the planned maximum levels already today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide distraction that only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt said.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predators.
The German Government therefore warns against the fact that "already small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of unborn children."
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, states on its homepage, in view of the maximum levels in force, that a "health threat to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury comes into the environment, in particular through the burning of coal.
According to a written information provided by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal-fired power plants have more than six tonnes of mercury per year to the Green House member Annalena Baerbock, two-thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "permanently and surface-covered," the "mirror" had quoted in March from the paper.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF warning system.
