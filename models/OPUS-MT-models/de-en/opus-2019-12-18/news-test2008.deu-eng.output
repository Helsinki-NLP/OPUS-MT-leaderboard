Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
Inflation in the 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected in November - an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded after the 2.6 percent in October, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are based on only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the Leitzsins. At their discretion, the reduction in interest rates would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment in order to create an inflation spiral.
The ECB strives to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a dilemma: it is necessary to "disable" inflation in order to exclude the need for action later on.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the eurozone is due to increased food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotes increased by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also experienced significant inflation in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but estimate the annual average rate at 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup orts government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while, according to Gallup, approval for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
The difference among party loyal voters is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry barrier: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who regard the country's economic situation as "very bad" been so high (41 percent), while a further 46 percent consider it "pretty bad."
According to more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families again view the change in their financial situation as more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - assessed the Prime Minister's work as "more bad than right."
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the percentage of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that we could get to grips with the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without changing government.
After the unrest last October, 35% said that the government and the head of government would remain, today this figure is only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty," and a further 20% would give their vote "probably."
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "with certainty" to the urns, a further 15% consider their participation to be "probable." Given these tendencies, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital allowance.
Moved to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the shares of opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area continued this year to maintain the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Handelsdreieck, the price of the usual Napi Christmas heritage increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF were recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets have "galoped off" last December, inflation has not fallen drastically in percentage terms compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they paid well under HUF 9,000 last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the examined markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained close to the previous year's level, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread were in line with data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of breadwakes for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price fall in the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink, including the deposit, only cost 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" cart comparison Auchan cut off most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations show that Cora's prices in the "Napi" shopping cart increased by 15 percent compared to last year's Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive one of today was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1.206.00 Forint, but the increase in VAT was reflected in last Christmas prices.
It is precisely this process that has affected trade: it seems that the department stores could not quite decide which price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were incalculable.
(If the dealer is planning the velocity of a product badly, it may fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, last year's inflation of the "Napi" shopping cart was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the 2006 value by 1720 forints, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630,00 forints more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, with the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, is not necessarily confirmed by the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office recorded a inflation rate of more than 30 per cent over the period of 12 months.
So beside flour also for eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has risen by barely more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to shift the drastic price increase to the multis.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the golden trade triangle; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the cash desk in all three department stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overcrowding of the staff - all factors that are not conducive to the containment of the infections, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
The injury of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a short time later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
By 10 December of this year, hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacilline.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in its nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the drugs are used too high or improperly, the well-responding bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant, which rapidly spread in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with a weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older patients or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday hospital life.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA does not exist only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nurses wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, the patients are examined for MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is too rare
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals could be avoided, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the control of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, the hospitals should examine the patients and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practised so frequently.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance fund for this study.
Most cases therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the Epidemiology Center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological investigations are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always respected by hospitals.
According to Karolina Böröcz, microbiological sampling is even rarer among outpatient patients or patients in basic care.
Saving of disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to the other by nurses.
It is precisely for this reason that hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient in the home hospitals.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, it happens in the financially less well placed hospitals, that with disinfectants is saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting to grips with MRSA infections causes the health insurance companies enormous costs, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the tendency of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death handlebar policeman wasn't drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The police chief of the XXII district, who had resigned, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the spokesman for the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the official report on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he entered the tax.
The former police chief, with his own car in the XXII. district, entered the Kossuth Lajos street and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the street at the zebra strip, rank.)
The pedestrian died after he was admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then resigned its functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Procuratorate has opened its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday totalling EUR 400 million, which will be used to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement for EUR 100 million was signed earlier and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million lent.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be devoted to the budget financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be used in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
During the meeting, the metro line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications would be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan rates are EURIBOR-linked, the loan is made available by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe looks closely at the Balkan state that was previously rarely mentioned.
What, where, and who buys the EU's cheapest market, but it is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought-after place for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea Albena, the "Gold Coast," the "Sun Coast," and the historic towns Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, however, real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also more and more in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russian has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offers highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, and thus attract tourists in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
For this reason, prospective investors are already buying in a large-scale way, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria also seek to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle, either buy revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the Top Ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of a medium- to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is constantly becoming more expensive due to ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there has been an annual increase of 21 percent.
The inflation rate in real estate prices far exceeds the rise in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the post-2012 emission reduction measures, i.e. the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a heated debate between industrialised and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue at the conference is whether the industrialised countries are prepared to support developing countries, in addition to reducing emissions, both financially and technologically.
An agreement has also been reached on support for developing countries.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the "Piac és Profit."
Hungary six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 levels) regardless of whether the "A post-2012 agreement" would be successful or not. The Union would even be prepared to commit itself to a 30% reduction if other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, were also willing to fulfil their commitments in a strong and responsible manner.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a decrease of 8% with its then 15 member states.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The deployment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only come into force after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed international emissions reduction system, whose importance was also highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the emission reduction, and raising the Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
British Army units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been broadcasting videos of Taliban-led operations since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The photos shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets are controlled at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such photos, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under Defence Headquarters in spring 2007 to publish videos of Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraq-based international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of foreign operations.
According to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie of the BBC, propaganda published in this way is almost free of charge compared to conventional television commercials, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored shots, also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, at most, the losses are discussed, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been loaded onto the platform, but this "genre" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "Americas Army," in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-scattered simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means impervious: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a work conference, where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas mood with tombola or kicks into the civil servants' hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the Defence Department, but not the staff of the ministry are expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Celebration of the Orphans" children are presented by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFI) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport beat the strings.
The 4.32 million Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics is held in the House of the Future, approximately 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFI) held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the State Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a dinner.
The hall rent was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFI is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt did not confirm this information because we did not reach the responsible parties.
What's with the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFI, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was said: There was no ball dress or suit on the ball.
The ministries of health, work and self-government prepare each for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her staff not to a Christmas party, but to the annual end of the year.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only served with coffee and Pogatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 forints.
Self-governance minister Gordon Bajnai will just toast with his colleagues in the auditorium of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 forints per capita - around this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-off.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM staff have celebrated every year in this way.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the Minister's official speech, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year reception on January 20th, the Ministry's Christmas celebration is cancelled this time.
One asks the one hundred guests to the castle Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the department, the expenses are measured with 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally start with a brief speech by the minister and end with a reserved feast.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor the Ministry of Education will hold a Christmas celebration.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment was unable to provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is organized in the Museum of Arts and Crafts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee for the indefinite duration of the strike beginning on Monday.
On Saturday a large-scale protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the stoppage of work begins.
Strike-related, significant traffic obstructions are expected, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, and from Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will cease to work indefinitely, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, when the law is adopted, the strike committees meet to discuss the way forward.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will take place only in the late evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes beginning on Monday will have to be expected to cause considerable traffic obstructions: the railway workers are putting down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies stand still.
At the same time, there will be roadblocks of one direction in many places.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others plan a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement was reached between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of railway workers VDSZSZ on sufficient services, although more and more people are traveling by rail around Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV is on strike from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy stop work for four hours, and the teachers' union in charge of the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for 2 or 2-8 hours strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association alternates nationwide at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and presents a new conception for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three is that the eligible professions will be given access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the ancillary lines and now demands a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
In the opinion of the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guards, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary," have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is "the intensification of the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term."
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such an argument, says the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "People in public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary conflict."
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote limbs, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
We remember that since autumn 2006 the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been on the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several organisations called "national self-defense association" have been founded.
"These groups are in common that they define themselves as civil organisations, while they openly boast about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catastrophe protection, national defense, defense), citing the inability of the police, the army, or the state itself," they said.
And further, all this happens according to the method that attempts to disguise various political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative, based on the political and party disgruntledness of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association are therefore not merely aimed at circumventing legal hurdles that may arise as a result of the registration at court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultranationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as a confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region," he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the founding of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background to the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately as the reason for the formation of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organization is "national protection."
In their opinion, a real "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state has remained de facto and indifferent, according to Political Capital.
And further, the initiative would have launched a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and risk-changing trends should be identified, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere Holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redisposing the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year brings us fewer such days.
In the EU and America, too, the term "holiday" means something else.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and work-free days.
Working days are mostly church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we are also celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve celebrations can rest.
All year round, we have fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15, commemorating the revolution of 1848 and October 23, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the foundation of the state, on May 1st the work is celebrated, on November 1st and 2nd we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day relocation" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is ultimately to be worked out, is laid down for long years by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants.
Only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays, are excluded.
In this case, the work regulations are only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country will remain formally standing, since most take time compensation for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holiday reserved for this purpose.
Next year there will be more holidays in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a day of rest.
The second repositioning is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, Friday, October 24th will have to be worked on in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely marked by the holidays, after everything will lie and stop from December 24, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy workmates
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we don't notice anymore: They bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is just whether you are getting used to these little inconveniences or whether you are better prepared to face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you someone from the marketing department called," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and repentantly admitting that you would have forgotten to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, you should think about how to give your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Something you don't own?
There's hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put any envelopes or post-it in your pocket from the office, because it could hit you yourself: no more, if you need it urgently.
Gossing about colleagues' private lives?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with who?
Where and why?
If possible, you should not tie the information (or guesses) about the personal life of colleagues to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals his inner secret to us, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, rather than align the one who is not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
When you call the office to report sick on the basis of tormenting headaches, because you feel uncomfortable right now, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: Your own work, unstoppable tasks, projects with fixed appointments must now be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't make it to the office the next day, or that something could come up, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Sum, giggles, phone calls
One is in depth in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggle of the colleagues?
Wouldn't you listen to a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
One should not annoy colleagues with humming, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over their heads), bragging, constant scolding or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not engrossed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the guilt of your forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for what is missing, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and slapping: Comfortable for home, but didn't lose anything in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually, if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it right for everyone - or how to get uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I'm gonna turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has for a long time not exactly spoiled us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage skirt is "in" again with its guitar quilt, the local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started playing in Pécs, even in the band Yonderboi, before he began to walk his own way - perhaps because a tavern doesn't tolerate two pipers.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he didn't manage until he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and, together with Yonderboi, named Zagar the almost only trendsetter that was also marketable in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy," but no one was interested in wearing this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still traveling with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - are noticeable.
With these songs the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle," introduced himself at the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song from the album even made it to the radio hit - the mr2 Petőfi, which has been broadcasting pop music since the very latest from early to late, has gradually set the earworm for the listeners with the number "Wings of Love," which was recorded with the help of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but in the same way they can only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
Also a good pop number can arise from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to record also works on this principle, independently of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Pop music has a greater tradition abroad, especially west of us.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively, because they also think they are part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it's a good feeling to see that more and more of our concerts are coming.
But we never composed for the market.
With us the music does not arise to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there are only in the incomprehensible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: if you want to do it right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go our way, let alone try to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more as a team player who trusts in the musical presence of the other and lets them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi's were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" is the top priority.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which was then to hold as a drawhorse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir from gifted soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later christened "Underground Divas."
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls co-create it?
B. Zs.: The number was already longer in the instrumental version, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this number still "needs something."
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came virtually immediately and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember I was pretty electrified back then, but it was the divas that needed it.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage.
Is it on purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to send them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting one's ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where to go, we just let these particular wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would like others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was made.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In musical work, there was actually no one at all, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma," where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls," where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but gradually everything has teamed up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and now that I have "released" the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool," "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same."
Deceptive broker risked billions because of inferiority
Groundless scammers
Thus his former employee Jerome Kermiel is called the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came for him by almost five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kermiel was only a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues right away, and was certainly not incapable of doing so.
Unlike all large bank houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He is mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who indicated him to the police.
However, according to Kermiel's statements, published by the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, he was a person who, at the end of last year, had achieved profits of 1.6 billion euros with his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed to earn half a billion euros just in the wake of the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were early news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had problems with paying off, would get into trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits and continues that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During all the interrogation, he admits that he forged records so that he wouldn't get caught.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Even during my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry the first big success came.
With the Allianz shares, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros in the London bombings on the price losses of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or guessed it.
"As long as I made money, you closed your eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
On a single day, he lost one billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
Thoughtfully, he went on a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A realtor who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be looked at in the cards," Kermiel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
It is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic will be able to receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The Transport Programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can obtain from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds to innovative enterprises.
The aim is for companies to gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful candidate countries to date in the current money acquisition from EU funds.
Nicaraguan Court Confirms Twenty Years in Prison for Ex-Presidents
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda in the nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the AP news agency, it is currently unclear whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) will be back in prison.
According to the chairman of the Appeals Court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officers whether they allow Alemán to serve his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
Four years ago, a court pointed out that Alemán had regularly postponed the government's money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to fund his campaign in 2001.
Budget is by:
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has drafted and was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This for the current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented it, and the ČSSD therefore could not allow itself to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally unobserved, yet highly important law in peace.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful subject for the media, and that is why they devote more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social-democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot at once eliminate:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is compulsory by law, not only in terms of pensions, but also in terms of social expenditure, which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit in budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third restriction is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and reasonably under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, apart from income from taxes, levies and bank loans, often unthinkingly issued bonds that overwhelmed their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through the mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state in the course of privatisation.
Now this source has already dried up.
To the extent that we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth that ČSSD boasts without interruption.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace, mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why no massive social programmes are needed, which, unfortunately, have been inflated to a huge extent in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in eliminating some of the senseless populist spending that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if the retirement age and pension reform are not postponed in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end and, no matter who is in power, nothing will remain for him but pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that ruling politicians then become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the suppression of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner planned for 2008 would certainly be superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we do not want it really to happen that ruling politicians become mere administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees, want peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to borrow each other's money.
For example, the American Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, and another 24 is loosening it for the European and Swiss Central Banks.
After the attacks of September 11th, it is the first time that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to countering or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
" Central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done when they decided to do so, " said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks are concerned that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after they failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used to lend money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid of borrowing money from each other, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and UK central banks had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks is helping to heat up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN International Conference on Climate Change on Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "Ein blauer, kein grüner Planet," he stated that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies them and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to present problems," said Klaus.
At the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his topic was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
So now those interested could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus pointed out that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he was an academic, able to understand and judge technical treatises, had experience with statistics and was also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience of totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he regards this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
When asked by those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who did not consider the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
60000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
60000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange, so that the authorities manage to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year's Eve hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not exchanged their driving license.
While small places report a sharp decline in interest in the early exchange, the capital's offices are covered with applications, and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration manufactures around 2000 customers a day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The exhibition of a new driving license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must add 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license will face a fine from January.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also use a reminder in the case of transgression.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even those who do not drive can be punished by the community.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of even 30000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the offices to exercise mildness and to impose a maximum penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatened a thousand crown penalty.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not an identity card that everyone, and a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take him to the responsible municipal office or to send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of having dealt with the gang of David Berdych, were arrested for 13 and 10 years respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organised Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision of the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also indicted in this matter, but first of all the first instance judgment is before him.
In other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He can't be sentenced to more than that.
In January 19, a district court found guilty of involvement in robberies, and today the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the charge from the beginning on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police officers, inter alia, in consultation with Berdych criminals, provided information from police sources, covered various robberies, and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The prosecution is about crimes committed by the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, whose victims have often suffered serious injuries, but also an assumption of office and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser scoper and a machine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has been enriched by its robberies by many millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, courts recognized Berdych and a number of others legally as guilty for further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's perimeter have to answer in another trial, further cases have not yet been brought to court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far escaped the main hearing.
Children exchanged - Bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to ask the hospital in Třebíč for 12 million crowns of compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each couple of parents.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore disagrees entirely with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," said Dostál after today's trial.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, however, we need the expert opinion that the opposite side had prepared.
We'll find out if it's even meaningful.
But we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál emphasized.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 2,000 kroner for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for each month that they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying degrees and depth.
The men put up with the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations against themselves that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, coped with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is now happening, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district governor of the Vysočina (Bohemian-Moravian height) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a replacement for expenses incurred by them as a result of the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by the law.
If in doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low sums of compensation, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka Came Around His Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trademark "Kingdom of Walachei."
According to the judge at the Ostrava District Court, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King," but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, this is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate parasitically in the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
All introduced themselves to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachian Kingdom."
The same is true of Harabiš.
"We have done almost ten years of work.
Money procurement and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a fight for money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasitically in our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that did not depend on the intention to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Walachian passports.
From an originally fun action a business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged, to which Harabiš then joined the establishment of the company "Walachian Kingdom."
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public for his entrepreneurial intentions in the "Manege" broadcast.
"Polívka's popularity certainly helped the project of the Wallachian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today's divided parties lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, culminating in the removal of "King Boleslav's I. elected until the Sankt-Nimmerleins-Day."
At the suggestion of Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková, the leading role then took place as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed the lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabiš for the throne and half a princess.
A new king was to emerge from this.
He didn't want to reveal details and an appointment.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the king's parade in Wallachia.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also sign up for this," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The combination with the designation SW is a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom in the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Move quickly
I'm just going through the interior for a second, not to repeat myself too much.
This is quite a successful design, where I have objections only because of the poor middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or head restraints.
The sidehold has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body here.
In the station wagon, the already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the hold.
I must call this (also because of the foldable rear window) very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with chamfers that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, let themselves be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the Czech best-selling vehicle of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left by clearly noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is already critical.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after the rear seats have been folded or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And frankly, that's what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family-hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes acts as if his exhaust was clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car beckons once again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric rear window lifters and...
The total cost of the car is 531,900 kroner.
This is a lot, but calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia once and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So there's only the choice which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools does not succeed
In British schools, the number of children from countries in Eastern Europe is increasing, causing the locals fears about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is aptly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Struggles, bullying and bullying among students have been transferred to relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended himself with the fact that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had supposedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students in The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more tense.
In the United Kingdom, 70000 Slovaks have been registered who came here to find a job.
Around 30000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation will come true if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and All Inclusive with waiters that offer pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
One of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, had it built because everything that was considered a crime in the US (especially during prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
==References====External links==
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, and across the wide boulevards cars drove, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult of the fifties still drive around in Havana, because the once imported Shigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and damp air.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may have come down badly, but nowhere around you can find as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are being cleaned out, such as Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for money from tourism, there was a green light for this development.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín Province and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marl that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauges to the sugar factories.
Her fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives, whose contemporaries are standing somewhere else in the museum.
Excursion destinations
The majority of visitors to Cuba do not leave out the most important places.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana anymore.
It remains to be mentioned that there is a museum in Hemingway's already mentioned estate, the visit of which should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, in their cavities fertile soil accumulates, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied itself in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was still no road there in the fifties of the last century that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of sugar factories."
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which is lively after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
Some call this town the most beautiful of the island in eastern Cuba.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo there, have to overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List, thanks to its pristine nature.
There the best chocolate is produced, in the church you can see the Cross of Columbus (actually it was created about a hundred years after the voyages of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, about all this one could write many pages.
But, as they say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas; in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of the countries that stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating States are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defense minister Robert Gates, called for NATO units to become more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan a forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the inhabitants to begin to develop their own economy and security," says British Defence Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the Afghan insurgents' activity has reached the highest level in five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they call for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
The Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, made similar comments today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop to the agency Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements are not as high for them as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British tabloid "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan non-Stuer unmasked: The Germans make games while our guys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German pictorial newspaper turned over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Public debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a state debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe itself 159.2 billion Konen this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on public debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"Until now, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, the iHNed.cz server.
Vladimír Pikora, analyst of Next Finance, sees it similarly: "We could come to exceed a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If the situation on the political stage should prove to be changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, this could take until 2010.
But I don't expect such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
The state debt stems from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The government debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by European Investment Bank bonds.
Domestic public debt rose to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The state's external debt has now risen by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable public debt reached 803.3 billion krona at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the growth is mainly in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of the public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to absorb 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum budget for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten billion reserve to pay for pensions, the financing of state bonds for 43 billion and a rate of 1.8 billion for loans to the European Investment Bank.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been indicted in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening and subsequently expelled.
The British woman was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students had complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum, was taken up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself had no sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knows her well, and she would never have done anything to get her close to religious beliefs, I regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, he felt this was just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that many students share with the teacher, who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in the class.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given second name in Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is regarded as a kind of homage to the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo concluded a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, explained the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, called for their commitments to maintain peace and continued the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of conciliation on 10 December
The Troika mediators that unite the European Union, the US and Russia will meet in Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, 90% inhabited by Albanian speakers, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika received a mandate from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this final date.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After having been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations of the last chance were conducted.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
However , he added that the Belgrade-proposed plan for autonomy is part of a past that has led to murders and deportations .
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken solely and solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a right of veto.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia , said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied to the journalists that Kosovo's parliament would have the last word on status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking population would be carried out in consultation with the Western countries.
Bush Unleashes Israeli-Palestinian Agreement
At the opening of the international peace conference held in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He also said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive settlement for the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything possible to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, recalling the two parties' commitments with regard to the roadmap for peace to which they had agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas are ultimately seeking a peace treaty to resolve all outstanding issues without exception, and including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems that are mainly the subject of the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the conflict of 1948, which is in the present state of Israel.
After the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he undertook to conduct the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption and to try to put an end to them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states , one Palestinian and one Israeli , which exist side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before it decided to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks on the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, says the Saudi Arabian prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic daily newspaper.
According to the Attorney General, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Office of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car headed for Villiers-le-Bel on Rue Louise-Michel.
He had no use, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green motorbike of the brand Kawasaki, without registration, i.e. not released for public road traffic (see below), came, driven by two youths without helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its driveway from the right, a policeman further explained.
The alcohol control carried out by the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (baulted fender, split windshield, torn bumper) shows the intensity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Attorney of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger," in consultation with the Chief Public Security Authority of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the Attorney General explained that she excluded the IGPN's responsibility at this stage.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident heard on Sunday night confirmed the version of the policemen, namely that this mini-bike came to its left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of grooves, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the floor, showed that the two vehicles had remained entangled until the policemen managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were obedient yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel a rumor quickly went round, according to which the policemen had left the accident site very quickly, and this without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious error in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, for which further investigations are necessary, and where one has to proceed very carefully.
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, says this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman limping.
Two more tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth phoned.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the events and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken away in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the policemen left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police did not help the young people.
The first aid was given to these young people.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, emphasized the prosecutor.
Tension is rising in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police struck down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had declared the emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken against the i framework of the emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades used by the law enforcement forces there.
Those then threw stones with which they injured the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested temporarily.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's attorneys have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionists, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had taken place in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the Lawyers' Movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken out against the state of emergency and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday night.
In the following days he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional, and contrary to the Supreme Court's decisions, the Magistrate of The News said.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to surrender command of the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the invocation of the state of emergency, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
It was expected that he would give up his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term as president would end.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than one third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of female pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless allowed better control of fertility.
At any rate, eight out of ten births are now carefully planned.
For one in five couples, even calculated exactly for the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylinder-shaped part that is soon to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5-ton module for power generation via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew went to restructure the solar panels of the module, with a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the Discovery space shuttle for a control passage and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meter long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very clever, he has a well-developed torso and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After checking the damage closely, he severed the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rails on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, wrapped with isolator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station invented and crafted.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the Discovery shuttle today in order to start their return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
Following the announcement by the Aviation and Defence Group that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the residues of the A400M, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21,96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the business performance of EADS has fallen from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large A380, carrier aircraft.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
Choosing the Status Quo
On Sunday, it won't be exciting to count the urns: the mass of Russians will opt for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very closed campaign, it confirms its pursuit of stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to voters on public channels, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He is doing so in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kremlin Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the president didn't get a glimpse of anything when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new attack point against the Western powers accused of interfering - his favorite subject during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost their way.
She denounces a campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration, according to his lawyer continues to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections, there are two questions that are much broader:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
Yesterday, the term of office announced the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot compete for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, which will select the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power so far will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further down: bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again relied on the model of a paternalist state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians freely renounce the personal responsibility that they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
What's the point of thinking?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands how to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think for a long time?
Those in power aren't so bad, why replace them?
A Difficult Memory
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed on a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and by name, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven states responsible for their administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the USA - agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct investigations, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these names-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One must not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, had explained Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism of the Technical University Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission figures, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will drive the two economic areas enormously forward and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros each year and services worth 10 billion euros, said Daniéle Smadja, chair of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, and regretted that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential.The EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England notes the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about curbing the current recurring concern about credit conditions and announced an offer of £10 billion at a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during that period , the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December , in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it states in a communication .
The Bank further states that on December 6, GMT will be put into circulation around 12.15 billion pounds (14 billion euros), at the real estate tax rate and only until January 10th.
This seems to be the first time that BoE has put liquidity into circulation in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the day-to-day differences in the interest rates of inter-bank loans at its base rate.
The day-to-day inter-bank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has adjusted to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that prevented banks from availing themselves of them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS' proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to rejecting the text.
The text of a Socialist niche (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, of which the majority was 50% on the employment allowance, the re-establishment of the TIP flotant, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to sometimes violent changes of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's TV contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the members of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of their proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances that had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones told from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes away from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says that his company and Melvin Benn's work alongside each other to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and we are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained stuck in political debates about the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Luckily we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at the Grand Park Chicago, after it became prominent in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to generate $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax dues.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place on the urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts together in order to give the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way in the American."
Vineland is halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is happy to take on the burden of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large," corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing has yet been confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasty rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the terminator opposes it.
These attempts are among the delegates' tasks.
A politically "heavy mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "Runaway Productions."
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best," he says.
The run at the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the advance of the cinema there is at the moment a top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the movies from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange facing an end-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
Investors are already rubbing their hands on the coming final year rally with almost five weeks to the annual financial statements on the stock exchange.
Nevertheless, the experts are not able to make certain forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to produce forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not if serious tensions determine the current market situation
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock exchange price is determined by the liquidity of the market and the market participants. Due to the lack of safe equity funds, they invest mainly in pension funds, which are severely affected by the upward trend towards profitable assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock exchange will have a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent to which the interest rate of the U.S. Federal Reserve may fall, an uncertainty mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of inflation rising.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sales Department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish equity index Ibex has already lost 4% of 15,945.7 points since its highest mark on 8 November.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
In the opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of investment funds and the traditional pension fund subsidy made around this time each year.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could develop somewhat differently this year, mainly because of the final year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore right after the bridge day to the Constitution Day.
In the analyst's view, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the current assessments of the market situation are at an almost technical level, which could soon lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of the values to drive the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana from Intermoney says it's time for the big figures this year.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile Federico Olucha from the Bank Inversis assures that the increases in connection with the banking and industrial sectors will go hand in hand.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, according to the expert.
In terms of increased consumer behaviour during Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine market activity in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
Over the last seven years, December has seen only two falls in prices.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real final year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 gained 28.17 percentage points, December showed an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has been rising by 8.36%) since January and also a final year rally will show up.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first banking group dares to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30h on weekdays and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definite decision.
The current negotiations between the Bank and the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement whereby 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for the clientele.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which will adapt to business opening hours, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular is pursuing with her project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the buying customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as they are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches already located in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of opening hours is linked to a new room design of the branches, which is characterized by a more current, colourful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but was accompanied by increased recruitment, as a branch now no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs around 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally reached an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the Managing Director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market. The channel he directed had increased its value by the double of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that is exactly what hurts me; not that we have a higher growth, but that we have had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too far.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, goodwill now reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has registered a total loss of 40.5% since January, with a market value of 2,193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other publicly traded communications companies is rising; in Sogecable's case, it is 3,571 million; in Prisa's case, it is 2,518.53 million; in Vocento's case, it is 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that it is two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question still arises to what extent we can actually act on a stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first TV station to receive more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue this year, which was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965,4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business increased by only 0.7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor for Telecinco's better exchange performance in comparison to the high payout ratio that the company was able to show up to this point in time: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría's company led a 100% dividend distribution.
Vasile, however, assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol's shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged by the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by the purchase of 33% of Endemol's shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced Telecinco's profit calculation by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced Antena 3's expected profit calculation by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buying) a more advantageous position than Antena 3 due to the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends resetting expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and poor economic climate)
The Congress approved the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which ended today with the Congress resolution in the Senate on the additional/amendments to the project, the government published the provisions arising from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate members, who in their negotiations and votes had the aim of establishing the best possible regulation that ensures investor safety and regulates individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market activity.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which is redefining the securities services code, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control entitlement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows for financial advice to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consultancy companies which are associated with the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
It also extends the number of financial transaction execution systems, adding multilateral securities business systems and trading order internationalisation systems to regulated securities markets, which would eventually enter into competition with current economic actors.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the priorities of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Congress's Economic Commission provided for further changes in retrospect, with the decision that the debt bond with titles must now be considered as complex financial resources due to its high risk level for the investor being confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of graduate economists was used; 30 years after the 1977 regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, laid down new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator who works on a foreign account, who does not need authorisation from the CNMV and who can offer his services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare the location and quality of US products by means of the disclosure of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be drawn up prematurely using the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator determined prematurely only serves as a benchmark and therefore does not have to be in line with the final result announced next 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister of Economic Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development, while the latter assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , in the halls of the congress building , Solbes noted that even if the current figure is not good , the inflation differential of Spain to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4% , announced the Minister of Economy and Finance in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half after the Bank asked the UK central bank for emergency loans in mid-September last year due to the crisis, and they now amount to only £12,000 million (this corresponds to €16,800 million).
At that time, the bank's assets amounted to record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to the loss of trust among customers and will continue to decline until the end of the crisis, despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money will be safe.
Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, must contribute approximately a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be made up of the assets of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds needed to achieve its 30 billion target.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to channel £50,000 million (equivalent to approximately €70 million) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which there are three other companies involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participating in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the village of Totano, Partido Popular, which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, on the grounds of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
Last May, José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and at that time chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and, according to information from the Cadena SER radio station, could be the original mastermind of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Town Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
The lawyer was also accused of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's residence on the basis of important incriminating documents that are to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report Morales' supposed order payments to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President-in-Office and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a socialist election victory, will take over the office of Congress President.
José Blanco, the Organisational Secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced it in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
The Heads of Government believe that the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to run for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who had announced last November that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, end his career in public politics and instead campaign for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government has been pressing for his return to political action.
He also pointed out that, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party would not deny the citizens who would take over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect and not insult or screaming in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time you get the impression that the only place where you can't talk calmly and calmly in Madrid is Congress; so the President of the Government was interrupted once up to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is a relentless criticism of both the skeptics of climate change and those who place a social and political debate on this issue, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in a need for explanation of his government's action or non-action, which has played a decisive role in ensuring that Spain is at the top of the countries that have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol's requirements within the EU.
Who are those responsible for non-compliance with the requirements, to which sectors this is due, and why has not its government, which proposed the contract with the planet, stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take to combat climate change without delay.
Which companies will be affected, which behaviour of the citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences will result from this.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanation in the future.
Just because it's about self-sacrificing and paying.
The measures that can be implemented in real terms against climate change are unpopular.
They are cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by PSOE seemed to Zapatero to be so strategically dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorate the meetings and inspire others with his gentleness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the village of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor were taken into custody because of the alleged suspicion of urban violations, it was reported today from the investigation circles.
The city council was arrested at his place of residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the search carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it was found that more than 2 million hectares of unexplored ground for urban development projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the property after the local administration provided it with illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subjected to an investigation, which was initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six arrested were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the investigation is also carried out against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have been part of Nuaria and received the bribe.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, made eleven further searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding business, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, with more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of space in Totana, which was to be rebuilt. The aim was to realize a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The group Nuaria includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonau, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression Book of the Month and instead try to invent a price name of other names with appropriate competencies.
I already have a suggestion.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which comments on the note published in the same newspaper on November 18; coincidentally on the day the issue of which contained criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abiturist who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, Chairman of the Educational Council for Philosophy, asked the teachers to take a more critical position against Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching be removed from the lower-level curriculum for philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which was concerned with six months in prison.
But if you rob again a music business below a value of 400 euros, this is only a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than when you download it (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than when you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute incurs a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, the author's authorization of which has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has really screwed up his demands.

My family doctor presents me with one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared with the help of a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science journal.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest if the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their answer and thus also got the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it will actually take so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the prosecutor's office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - are the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian-Bossian leader Radovan Karadzic still at large.
Their names are on the list of the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss attorney from Belgrade to New York in her intention to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on their respective governments to tighten up their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance covering a possible damage event caused by the driver involves a high cost, the amount of which again depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of production of the driver's licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an policyholder.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which establishes that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit the corresponding compensation in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance which consists of several factors, including age, sex, time of drawing up the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to pay less contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the company's conviction.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In drawing up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that suits his personal needs most.
At this point, we now list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles when choosing a low-cost insurance policy, such as low driving practice and a young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out a full comprehensive insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full insurance cover, so that the benefits of a full insurance cover, but are offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount incurred by the damage itself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europa, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to reduce the insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. This is due to the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it is most appropriate to opt for a full insurance with excess.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been removed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who has no children to take out full insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the corresponding person allows it.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate and, accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full comprehensive insurance with excess interest (for an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy that only applies for the third year of the vehicle is recommended.
Luis Noguera notes that they are more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment.
For pensioners, it is possible to take out a full insurance with excess insurance (for an amount of 150 euros) or an extended insurance, which only uses with a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, it is important to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it involves high costs, which require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan for the final score
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point they lack in San Siro next Tuesday to reach their respective goals before the final round of the Champions League. Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while they decide to join the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another one to make sure that the FC Sakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The group D's two games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA World Championship in Japan, where he will compete for the first time in the semi-finals for entry to the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished in front of everyone else and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the all-time expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home because the Keltik Glasgow knows that they would become group first in the event of a victory and thus have a better starting position in the eighth round.
The team of Gordon Strachan could be defeated even in a flop of FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points match the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but could win in the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to spoil the Scots for the evening. They hope to reach the second round of the final of the redesigned Champions League, after they were defeated in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the post-season (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the game.
While Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the team will have to concentrate on their own game, as both the achievement of the eighth round and their UEFA membership depend on their victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to take part in the biggest European Championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win third place by winning and thus participate in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour in front of 20,000 spectators in Vancouver, Canada, after the band was disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video of the band's history, which caused a sensation at the end of the 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headslines and voodoo, which is released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the fan crowds that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the shove, Victoria Beckham said that the British star didn't get to see our wardrobe once, so I'm already curious about what he's going to do about the show.
Sporty Spice , whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 resulted in the dissolution of the group two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed her nervousness at a press meeting two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said about the separation of the band that had caused it nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the quarrels had been resolved and that everyone was very fond of each other.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the Spice Girls' last joint appearance in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines machine, according to the report of the TV station CTV.
Upon her arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannys.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is disappearing between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports being affected by fuel to Western Europe.
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit charges.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be charged more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% in addition for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," said the Minister of Economy of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve controls on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said one member of the control body.
The recommendation of the Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought in Scotland in connection with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service did not have any precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a SUV was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October, and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to the recruitment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain such information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, among other recommendations, that the Executive Board should take up guidelines of the criminal record statement, which helps employers with controls in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some personnel records, these have not been routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative guidelines to a large extent before hiring, but added: "Our report identifies areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health service staff is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that current pre-selection tests by the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the board of directors had problems identifying those employees who were on leave indefinitely.
The investigation also found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were predominantly observed.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for pre-employment controls for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on control investigations prior to the recruitment of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division Dominates Film Award Ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has received five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the best film.
Awards were also given to leading actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded as the best leading actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting the British film into the world public.
The prizes were handed over in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was shot for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has brought two prizes to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director debut.
Rock music was the center of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for the best documentary film.
The award for best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg's thriller Easter Promises in London.
Ray Winstone, who stands in the reputation of playing tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose movies include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, which was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect plants after a failed Al Qaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested were part of a cell led by a "rocket expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reported that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees had planned to kill clergymen and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis seeking Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied Armed Forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader to target the pro-Western Saudi government - are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and facilities in the energy sector.
"This was a very big effort of the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims, who support violence against Muslims, who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could show a glimpse of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on an orbit show that the planet is even more like an averted twin of the Earth than it was previously aware of.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus is somewhat closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago Venus would have ruled conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unabated carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotational speed, Venus set a completely different development course.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which examined the planet for a year, provide a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar. "
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched Uranium" seized by the police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he didn't consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally agreed to face a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters take questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party that is going to start next year's elections.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with selecting YouTube clips to show the prospective candidate.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed tips of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed himself forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he had been obsessive about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly concerned when questioning whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, succeeded in hacking this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances of being nominated, but they both stay in the race, perhaps because they hit the immigration stake earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: stricter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears about poisonous toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to argue that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations of first place in a recent survey in Iowa, thanks to his long-standing Christian Conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was urged whether Jesus would support them, he laughed at it and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his convulsive storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been shot up out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more popular and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the very beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both parties' wings.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party Pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No nobility titles seem to have been sold, no politician's Parisian hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has covered up donations for the British ruling Labour Party for more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that the contested Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister had withdrawn from the demand for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly perceptive chairman of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has developed into Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a broken bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have raised business associations against the government.
The tax-related loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative messes.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be minister of the armed forces, they claimed, is a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and her former head of fulfillment) has already resigned.
None of this means Brown is going irreversibly towards the departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and it doesn't even take long to be there, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to leak; the Cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his chief lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's mishaps - as with the long "money for nobility titles" investigation of political party financing - voters may assume he was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks
The wrongs are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely deceived.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's Stalinist tendencies, of course, have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new appeal for political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but he was not entitled to make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for one clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just as Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financier, was told about the strange donations in October.
But until now, Brown is not involved: there is nothing that suggests that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grasping a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to make the measure full by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "teachings to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a sweeping reform of political party financing.
This would require Labour hardliners to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through incontestable righteousness and solid competence.
Map sharks
Is the credit crisis hitting America's credit card market?
If there's blood in the water, it's just natural that dorsal fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is offending, the predators are targeting the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the retirement and the retirement rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are either non-recoverable or more than 30 days late.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its US consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Loss and losses are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained partly by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large part of the kedit card losses; the number of applications (and hence default fees) would increase again whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and the confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the 2007 volume will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers take credit card debt, now that home loans dry out.
However, the card exhibitors look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's credit rating.
They can even be of benefit to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall when real estate is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and completely revalue the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in Enron's case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former chief financial manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests in a guilty manner on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer, using telecommunications resources.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. district judge Ewing Werlin Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two years of extradition proceedings.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastow's attention to the fact that he was the aim of a government investigation into Enron's decline.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to cheat a fraudulent conspiracy with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership owned by Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron companies that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
One company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others ransacked about 12.3 million dollars, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed guilty on two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison term in Louisiana's federal prison.
Kopper is serving three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, collapsed in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer mask the billions of debts or make weakening businesses look profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling has a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were nullified after he passed away last year for heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of an aircraft of Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats because it is for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires' Exhibition, a four-day orgy of showcased consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury exhibitors had set up exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly paid Russians in everything, from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-covered car grilles, which would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"That's a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas at his peak.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in flocks where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians stand out as the world's most free-bodied donors.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow, this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires with a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived below the minimum subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-kept and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they go through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking for the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to focus primarily on the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic for several hours to visit a drafty warehouse that shamelessly placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically sat at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old is according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company to equip high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer needs, said he sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which resembles linked chain-arms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four replacement.
"The Russian millionaire who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There's more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red phone booths full of mountains of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the piles of money, mobile photos while leaning back in the middle of the spare wealth, being snapped by friends, or just to take a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
botched operation suspects death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving Day when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors further down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical coroner's van approaching," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which could not be available for weeks, will help to solve a mysterious death that has sent a mourning through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and persistent," said Mr McCarthy about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the Prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Ms. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have not communicated much about their investigation or about the owner of the house that is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to tell me if Mrs Castro was being questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro's house, where a faded rose shrub stands in the narrow front yard and barks a Dalmatian behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled with "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find his way into provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to the rise in world stock markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts were reinforced by appeasement comments from the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Central Bank, said that politics had to respond "flexiblely and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm dismal markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in the market functions of late September and October."
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate reductions.
The statements also helped to calm Wall Street, given other bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for heavy losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage lending sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 Index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany's Index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emerge of credit pressure on markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to European commercial banks had been given a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow up and feed further capital into the money markets in London rose as the credit tensions were seen to increase the three-month "Libor" rates of lending between UK banks at 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a steady increase since 21 November.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who's gonna be number six for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral chairman, is here to help the head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electoral offices, if not for those part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to pin down exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets above the lowest rank, sometimes due to lack of happiness rather than ability.
It's not just in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same can perhaps be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time, if he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular chances of order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, when James Anderson was, apparently, playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind constricted into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still fighting to solidify himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion during today's net session at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, speaks and an excellent record against shotballs.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection by the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum from his beating that was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a scoop of joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently turned over a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) out and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he pins his middle speed with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to suit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Perhaps this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah may not look good when, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who's gonna play here this weekend.
Busses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraqis did not allow to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the US, has helped to expel Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his home in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been lured by the increasing tranquillity in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who armed and in cooperation with the American military defend their neighborhoods.
But more talked about having been forced home by visa problems and ousting funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably escaped from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were driven out of Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflict will occur.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saar countries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saar country that we are not French" - this slogan is self-ironically portrayed by the smallest federal state for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in Saarland's education system, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
For example, the universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Students can still complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But the Saarland also brings the Landeskinder in an above-average number to the universities - many of them without a degree at the Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their qualification at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also comparatively much expanded.
In terms of population, dual degree programmes are the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in general schools," says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
For example, the government introduced national comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last year of the day is free of charge - a model that is now also being copied by other federal states.
Whether the performance of the pupils improves sustainably will only show future comparative studies.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians are counting better.
And Pisa's foreign language skills are not measured to the distress of the Saar countries - otherwise you could score points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez adjusts the watches
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the timepieces in the South American country turn back by half an hour.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez becomes a joker.
According to a new law, the Venezuelan Official Journal reports that clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, inter alia, by the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) that he would break off relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia because of a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is driving forward a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia in order to release hostages.
Uribe had "spat in the face" in Venezuela with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain too, Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new cell phone ringing sound causes a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
Spain's king Juan Carlos spoke to him, who was annoyed at the recent Ibero-America Summit by the constant shouts of the left populist and had driven him over his mouth.
Germans threaten to pay down in 2007
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect in real terms less in the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price increases in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild"-Zeitung.
New burdens could also be imposed on employees in the case of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products had driven the inflation rate to the highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to the Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind vortexes on the Poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has demonstrated - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature."
According to the famous "prime soup theory," lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the beginning of the nineties no probe had been on its way specifically to explore this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighbouring planet with the Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa informs.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large as 12,100 kilometres in diameter.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it revolves much slower around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus hardly resembles Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets have been formed under very similar conditions.
On both of them, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for their attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balance in foreign policy, the Federal President emphasized, but took Merkel in protection from the accusation that she is running a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "showcase policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership not only unloaded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to information from the SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
China denies that when European politicians officially receive the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Road battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots as in France.
Everything had to be done so that social discontent in Germany would not be released by force on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister for the Interior.
Barricades were burning, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the heavy youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must ensure that social explosives do not build up in our own countries and are released by force.
We must take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not every young person copes with the rapid change in social reality.
Federal Government, Länder and local authorities have already worked hard to resolve problems, said Schäuble.
This concerns not only the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, this is already showing first successes."
However, it was too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, youths had taken heavy street battles with the police over the past nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burning in Toulouse.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
Faced with the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects."
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under 25 years of age is "above average."
More training places had to be provided in particular.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "social control in families takes place."
Moreover, many youths with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents have built up here.
Kolat admonished: "But still we have to be careful."
One had to "give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training quickly."
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flying over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, an array of around 1000 security forces has been providing peace and quiet.
The police would intervene as long as necessary, Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On the night of Tuesday about 80 policemen had been injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
On the night of the following, the riots overtook Toulouse.
The riots flared up in a traffic accident, in which two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the prosecution's initial findings, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
In the Empire of Angela Cloud
The chancellor's appearance, far from reality, documents that the coalition is at the end of its content - and that nothing can be expected of it itself.
Which country does this Chancellor live in?
After her dreary appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wretched and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that finally had to be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that she was too focused on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag it has clearly documented for all how much their accusation applies.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: an abducted politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in the approximate position even there.
Example of climate protection: She praises herself for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate goals in this country.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodestness would have failed the CDU boss two years ago.
Now she clings to the floes, that the boom arrives with the people.
She thus damages her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of making the world beautiful.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud, domestic problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-income people?
She's got a few extras left for it.
It is significant how often she promises when it comes to the children's supplement.
Merkel needs three sets to bring out a halfway straight set.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney offer a tough exchange of blows - and now they have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already unloads itself on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
In turn, he counters with serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a port for illegals," says Giuliani, and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having privately employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blowing to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The self-twisted 30-second videos that Internet users sent via YouTube are hardly more than keyword providers.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is heavily read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn waterboarding, a method of interrogation that simulates drowning, as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida show that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains, crunching and asking the base and the television audience that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets into trouble when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules civil for the first time
One day after his resignation as head of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Eight years of military rule in Pakistan will end.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had given his office as Army Chief to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus bowed to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unblooded military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf imposed on 3 November.
Soon after his swearing in, Musharraf will, according to the Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thereby fulfill another West demand.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four more were injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies plays again: the three band members of Harmonia took their consoles back in Berlin at a concert.
A recording from her great time "Live 1974" will be released on the Revival.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The intended sensation then occurs in the form of three set gentlemen on the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the blossom-white shirt at 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally fits into a conventional piece of music.
That doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band plays harmonia again caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Here, one may reveal: Targeted requests showed that the name, although confused by the collective pop memory, was not so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially in England and America, what misleading Krautrock means was always more important than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life's Work to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group in 2003, the hall was filled with questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudatio, the surprise knew no limits.
Michael Rother later played on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the foreign is one thing.
Memory is already overwhelmed with harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the perhaps most radical German group at that time.
However, around 1973 Rother followed the cluster musician into exile to Forst im Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-volatile municipalities.
Less ideologically than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
It's more like being an artist.
In the bulky garbage there was also a pennant of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art.
Some held Harmonia to it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe."
Because so calm and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
Gathering rice was not just for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50 people, as someone believes to remember.
Von Rother came up with a desire to force and occasionally practice harmonia.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother ended up in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts."
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griesseme live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating the Krautrock as its very own German contribution to live music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler."
There's the Loveparade inventor, Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of influences of Krautrock on subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills in the empty space of the supergroup.
The sentence by Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producer with harmonia in the farmer's room.
The legendary formation serves projections of further black and white photos of wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again concerned with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to elicit unheard sounds from the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth tinkerers.
The choir of the house doesn't change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are coughed and whipped and sung in a beautiful place with Emphase "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were searched for less in blues than in music schools (can), technologies (power plant) or on the flight from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Who calls here "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia can not be taken away from it even now.
Even the most natural thing is thoroughly rethought on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Kurderische Frieden" two films deal with the Balkan War.
But they both don't convince.
Either the concepts put too much emphasis on action and ballers, or they're too touching.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party."
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but the actor Richard Gere has now been found in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice and insignificant roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism excited one's desire for sight.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes a hunter" (Why does film titles have to be always as long and confused as locomotive driver tariff agreements?).
He provides a wonderfully wink-in-the-eye presentation: In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been done if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has long gone behind his very best times, but who has preserved considerable remains of the former charm as a ruined monument to his decline.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden," which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war movies.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb woman from Kosovar snipers, and one of them immediately falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evil, the television flat film loses itself too quickly in ball and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serb war criminal "the Fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories resemble each other strikingly: Both times small teams go into the woods to do something that the military cannot do and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the down-to-earth cynic with heart as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also invent a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Eventually, "The Hunting Party" will go down the drain if the reporters succeed in the time-lapse procedure within the last five minutes what Nato, CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not managed in five years: Catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to just revenge.
This is so bad that we want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologist.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still walking around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (for once, they should agree) not to do the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I compassionately see the swollen forehead veins, suggesting: how exhausting it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly those swell-heads, but they indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq movies were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: there has never been a good South Africa movie.
It's almost always true that when a star is floating around on the world's crisis herds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are still too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List."
Some film will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" now considered classics were by no means unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps we know today where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" finally became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastically distant artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrible way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Criticism reaped by Beust for Olympia Absage
The mayor's departure from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with fierce criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust urges realism in the assessment of opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a waiver on Wednesday as "not good for the business location."
No other project has recently developed as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the sport policy momentum would not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "starting from a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation to apply for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich, which was expected for the beginning of December.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period until 2028 that we have thought of so far."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to take a chance by burying the plans at this point," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application was also in contradiction to the statement of the head of the Senate at a reception to the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There, von Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Hochschulsportverband had only nominated Hamburg as an applicant city last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has placed Olympia on the map and excluded housing," said SPD MEPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia for the Little Grasbrook and a later use of housing, the CDU had unilaterally set the "event factor."
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had sparked a great enthusiasm at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine the concepts of Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently in Sweden fabricated wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering conclusion: the six "Brillo-Boxes," which the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the approximately one hundred other Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" that are circulating on the international art market.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cartonage Factory.
They were not works of art, but their role models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968 Warhol probably granted permission to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at that time as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the name "type Stockholm" rightly entered into the art and auction history.
Some of them have achieved more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that some hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has investigated the six Brillo boxes in addition to the museum's own, three private Swedish owned ones, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press plates were first primed and embellished, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press plate with a paint roll without primer - in addition, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, they have been shrouded in relentless silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillenes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillenes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to guard him had apparently run over to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops locked the district around the prestigious hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillenes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who used to command the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units were about to join the march.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
As early as 2003, Manila's financial district was the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo.
The rebellion failed after almost 24 hours because of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase the stake in Freenet AG, it was stated.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
