28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last he was uphill again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, reported the medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the LMO station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and devastated" about his death.
"We're a small team working like a close family and we're gonna miss him painfully," the speaker said.
Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," told Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD's reference telephone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
In an interview, the Hollywood star has now made this quite clear.
"I am always put in drawers or am glued to labels from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not want to be always perfect and successful."
"Honestly, I'm rather sniffing these things."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose dots and Mexican food, says the magazine.
She asked the question about the children's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love Is Not Children's Play," Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The movie will be on ours from August 25th.
Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of a change with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their closing night, they chased home to the food troughs in a quick gallop.
One kilometer at that pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And with that the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.
He and his family were led over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swung for photographic purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sports Aid presented the Golden Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete is not lacking in awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silberes laurelblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been promoting young people for decades.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the double U.S. Masters Champion was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rowers Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball players Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society went to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's Economic Policy Comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
He said that he would go back massively on regulations, and he was in favour of far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to fulfil, that it has opportunities for disadvantaged people and that it needs money for them.
That's why the taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
They have to be invested in, say Trump and Clinton almost identically.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strongly rejected by the Republican Republican's Teaparty wing, for example.
So Trump could still have internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal production in the USA.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and the Paris Climate Agreement is to be terminated.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in the case of infrastructure, but also in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
They should then also be paid better, demands for example Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage has to go up, then he says that he must not be changed.
But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics suggest that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every woman who has fled has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost everyday for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.
Each one has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in his arms.
He looks with big eyes curiously into the room.
His mother is staring at the table top.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria in the north of Munich.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
Recently, it was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard outside the door.
"It is not excessive to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as bearers of hope," she says.
For women, other reasons prevail: "Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out. "
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her away.
On the run, it goes on.
"For example, the fact that tugs require sexual action for a bottle of water is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is mistaken, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and at worst abused.
This means that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not arise voluntarily."
Many women are so used to not saying anything.
"Or they dare not speak openly about what they have experienced, because shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help themselves, it only needs more accommodation for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
Some say no to the question of whether they know of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of responsibility.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government shelters.
Even in Swabia alone, refugees are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesperson for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Central Franconia, some community accommodations have floors or their own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"If privacy fails or if men and women are housed together, violence against women can happen - more and more -."
Above all, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, says the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be read from the crowd on the house in Munich.
"Since talking about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Strike assistant doctors: demands for new industrial action
Deputys of resident doctors have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes concerning a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns about the treaty.
Assistants and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday night, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently calm" to problems, resulting in the Treaty being rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action that begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to an intern strike six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
After the election, the head of the BMA resident Dr. Johann Malawana resigned to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 resident doctors and medical students, that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yeah.
But Putin's smile looked slim and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his reserved circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as having behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to suggest the opposite.
But a long-lasting coolness emanating from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the launch of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was rage.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to make some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost relieved of office in a failed coup d'état last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "tourists there, tomatoes this way."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is furious at the West as it regards its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.
In addition, there is the continuing resentment about the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup d'état.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime changes.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one, as an analyst once described to me, "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel violated and ill-treated by the West and now unite.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they hadn't even covered the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralized headquarters and listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for retail banking that will become more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we do not pursue global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to become the bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three times the winner Dettori, who won before on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes on the cheer as he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby Champion had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have fascinated fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey, he would have already won 6,000 prizes!
Frankie has already ridden nearly 30 years of winners in GB, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was annoying.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until his at least 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin it is stated that Putin, without giving reasons, "ordained Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who was Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he was later head of the protocol and head of the staff of the government.
About his appointment he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as Head of State with regard to draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, is there a kind of power struggle here?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead Russia's environmental policy at once - met with great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, in a conversation, I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - arduous post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov assumed the position in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios producing the series announced their resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident," he said in a message.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg has been a part of the series since the first season of 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart's blood in them for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a message published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won't be possible anymore.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans, who can only wish for a show.
The scheduled broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
Riddles about fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish may be sand eels spawned from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "decker blowers" that are approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sloping ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of truly epic dimensions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in place, and the last section of the deck is now given a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents pioneering construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the north tower deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.
Heikel, because the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Salvation in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "lucky to be alive"
Three men have "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from its own power.
"We saw the boat spinning around her and imagined the worst," said the head of the rescue station at Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we let it water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a buoy without a lifejacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, this, however, detached itself from the person who steered the boat when the boat was centered.
Someone watched over these men today.
Seriously injured - man stabbed his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and badly injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholized perpetrator cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
But she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her companion.
On the street, they met the man's ex-life mate.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's favorable apartments?
The SPD and the Greens think that investors should be much more committed in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a concept of "housing."
But dispute is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There is no regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens that if you want to build on urban areas, you will have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the favorable apartments can also arise in the inventory.
However, according to Bratmann, the big argument in the City Hall is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but preferably 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs funding, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, according to Bratmann, the situation in the housing market is beginning to worsen.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.
But how do we compensate for the loss of some 1,300 more favorable apartments whose funding will end in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, the city should now buy out the bonds.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into price fixing.
That's possible in the West City.
At one stroke, the problem could be solved.
In the Weststadt, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners, the housing companies do not want that.
For if the number of social housing in the West City is again increased drastically, one moves away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should be no concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must go on board."
Although it concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.
However, it does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later an animated series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest fell somewhat before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "caught."
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person travels every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of tracked people training 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want people to "take 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" met with deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What the hell?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortless on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of the eye under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the suspended beam during the women's single multi-match finals in the arts tournaments at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-strong title, and the fifth overall, as she strengthens her reputation as the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, won 15 World Champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton told her that she was "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug each after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-match finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi she served as an exclamation mark.
Although Biles insisted that she never planned the future during her long journey to the top, that is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - including their typical Tumbling Pass - are adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a multi-match competition, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even if Mustafina easily led through two turns, the picture deceived.
Floating beams and ground gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurked.
She caught up again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and put another one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears poured on Bile's shiny red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw Kusshände to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial killer case while listening to music in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger's side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder didn't seem to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker didn't take the purses or the $2,900 held by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it was connected with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more injured in nine attacks, mainly in Hispanic residential areas.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a CBS subsidiary, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on site.
One Witness told the police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, assuming that it was the serial killer's work.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know anything about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved with that.
Which isn't right at all -- of course you got involved in it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that he be institutionalized.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know that people were still doing that," Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund couldn't sit or crawl until he was 3 years old and he still can't speak.
But he's making progress.
He can run with support and bike riding.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has devised for "Please sing something before me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of Mississippis flooded their banks and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that help is already on the way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, reported that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service reported that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
The meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as it will flow slowly over the stepped rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9:00 a.m.
Rescue teams still plucked people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife Hansford said that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had rescued all three in a large military truck and had taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "expanded quickly" as heavy rains continued and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil has been heavily covered by the rains since Wednesday.
The authorities reported that heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the failure of teaching in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of Tangipahoa 200 had flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of Robby Miller community said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets washed up by the floods.
Emergency shelters were set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuated.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the floods and sandbags were provided for the residents to take away, hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last big flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but none were reported on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Punched by bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police reported that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the lumbar, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious of his transport to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe this.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy's family told the station that he was likely to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Bullet casings for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles oversaw the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were pods.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," policeman Anthony Ginaldi told the police station in Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests, and the police are reportedly checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a ricochet on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm imagining during the women's Olympic team in gymnastics for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, which rounds off Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts was an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three times the world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not what gym classes look like all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics is primarily done in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnastics and families).
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must enable the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to train more easily and easily.
I founded my 20-year gymnasium.
At my events we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that get thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by fetching the Olympic team gold and thank you, she felt so many young girls motivated with different backgrounds to start her way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to forcibly implement the contract and said that the NHS was in a "no-man's country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first resident doctors are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Internship Physicians, said last night in a communication: "Internship doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current staff crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks met with the government's unwillingness to participate and sometimes deafening silence.
This was the promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the coercion and address the cares of the intern doctors."
If he does not do so, the intern doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly reward for the 54,000 resident doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, called on the intern doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Labor struggle measures do not achieve anything of the little, but burden already overloaded teams and service providers and only cause problems, hardships and interruptions for patients, nurses and their families. "
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Interns and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training desks, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health with regard to compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities have recommended that this be given to more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-coagulation drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or further heart attack.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arteries that form plaques.
When the surface breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogged blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making blood clots less likely to form.
The draft guidance for NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences. "
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The guidance draft does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Political Correctness Culture Blossoms Election Deception in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the request of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities knowingly being ignored as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up cords outside electoral booths to protect intimidating voters.
He recommends that voters should have an identity card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to name his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person's finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but also aims to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in east London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses another.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
In particular, he expressed his alarm at the fraudulent election of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including holding ID cards to prove the identity
The report states: "It is appropriate to prove that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists to process mailing documents to stop "electoral harvests."
The report under consideration by Theresa May also requires harder registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before voting.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once she has given up her vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
perform systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic mailing.
Prohibition of political activists working on full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
Give the police the authority to set up lockouts around election stations.
A change in the law which facilitates an indictment for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
No photographing in polling stations.
Request that only English may be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no lawsuit was filed.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhak controls" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and obscure spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's bike double and other famous doppelgangers from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come across the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot this week, who has proven to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But this summer the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold who has his own famous double - at least not if one is allowed to believe social media.
In honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently shimmering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's doppelganger on the cycle track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. Archery team Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of the Wolf of Wall Street Star show up.
In fact, the archer got the madness on the social media and admitted that since his childhood he has been hearing that he looks like Leo.
"I myself don't see much resemblance, except for facial hair," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more central this year: the all-out similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a doppelganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gear higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another sustained comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to be like an "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face form and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put into space: According to this user, there might be a reason for the pair's similarity
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
Indeed, US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for saying that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m Freestyle Swimming Squadron outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian station CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "won like mief" and during the race like "a pig died."
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming squadrons.
MacDonald, who had been brought to CBS's commentator team to give more "color," could be heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman lost her connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like a mist, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming squad 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which enabled the Canadians to unlock the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming squad for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many questioned him.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment being aired on a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunate wording, we are sorry that it happened."
In the end, CBC apologized over 90 times to the people who responded to the notice on Twitter
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to our followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the Women's Swimming Squadron in the CBC Olympics program, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark outraged at woman who tried shamelessly underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on panties.
To make the situation worse, she checked out what she looked like in it, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried out four pairs of underwear in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her underwear before putting her back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underwear from the drawer, took off her own tights and trousers and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took off the panties, which obviously didn't please her, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more panties before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, put on and out again.
"She didn't seem to mind seeing someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the panties she had tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take panties home that had another person on and were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I heard, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of panties and find out that another woman was wearing them and moving out again and they were not washed."
A spokesperson from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our Folkstone branch on Tuesday August 9th."
All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect oneself against weapons attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your robber.
If you are approached from behind, you should turn around first, so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting him with your free elbow in the face.
Then hit him with his knee in the groin and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker curls in pain. Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight onto the gun and hit the attacker's chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before they move backwards and point the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Take a look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga Grand Master, it's safest to hand over your money to a robbery.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a travel guide in the most dirty places in Europe
A British traveller subjected his immune system and strangle reflex to a serious test - licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk drove his train on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved with.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the sink knob of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his bowel by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railroads at railway stations to wash buttons of toilets, the task definitely placed his immune system under a sample
In the film, he said: "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "
In the film, he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His test sample showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "This comes close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything in here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.
We went through crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the movie, added: "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things that made it easier for Ian to lick her and others that made it pretty difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing accompanying lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroyed Before Delogation Social Housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social home after a delogization with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocking employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floors were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.
The family were resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for Cornwall Housing's home administration, said she was afraid the apartment wouldn't be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn open
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and had to be called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly lied to her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The delogization was hailed by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
"Tomorrow we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
Trash and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the town hall
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since a delogization is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terribly visible to their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging on the floor
Workers of the house administration will now have to clean up garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she was guilty of possessing a class B drug intending to trade.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say they're gonna delog tenants who don't follow the house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police reported that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This is for those who think that they can behave without self-conjecture, as well as for those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a low-flying military jet flies over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the air force dropped an incredible dive
The air forces claimed that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists start panicking after a low-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic videos showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach over the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The vacationers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what came up through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By on social media, said, "Twice it really flew very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese air forces today claimed that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visibility of nearby fires, the jet flew a little deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that security was not endangered at any time.
Land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limited his vision
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans compete in the duel for the Spanish Supercup away against FC Sevilla, and the return game will take place three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner has to give up Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic soccer tournament with the inferior Cup finalist and the ruling European League champion among others.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament dip in the knee during training, which at least for the time being clears the question of one at Barca in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique did not make a clear decision on this subject and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, there are doubts with the Spanish champion about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Also at 3:2 in the rehearsal gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Seville, on the other hand, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana."
With eleven successes so far, Barcelona is the record winner in this competition.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4.4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
With this, the world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made up the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the name of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top of the Olympic stairs was the former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and in time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had withdrawn to the grandstand and let their protégés go to each other in a fair competition alone.
"I played the matches up here for my country."
"I play for myself in the final," Zhang had consistently said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma really had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Afterwards he set the speed at the record and left Zhang with only 13 points.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter-finals against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the Belarusian had suffered a rib injury, was then in medical treatment, had to content himself "finally" with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympia-fourths in similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits ′′huge problems′′ in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually sprawling and self-confident multimillionaire expressed some sort of concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
"We have enormous problems in Utah," Trump said to Evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
False reports of his candidacy were to blame, he resumed his well-known media scheming.
Republican strongholds wiggle
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey conducted by SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor from Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were equal.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not at the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just as I have done so far."
And pushed afterwards: This will "either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long vacation."
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, Trump's party threatened to cut funds to support his campaign if he couldn't present better poll scores.
Instead, the Republican candidates for Congress would be given more support.
Olympia: Thirst scam in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are facing trouble after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After an attempted fraud during a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This has been reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers.
The IAAF World Federation has requested the IOC to provide information on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, IAAF will carry out an evaluation," stated an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave up the sample and signed it," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed his country's athletes about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested when he returned to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
In the announcement of the IOC's more than 2000 doping target controls prior to the Rio Games, it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.
Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in compliance with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
In a series of TV reports by the ARD, there have been repeated allegations that doping means are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is to be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been shown that this sport has been doped comprehensively and systematically.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With it a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classicism and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youthful dream.
In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he raves.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her lovership with Tony with sorrow, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there's Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman woman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It's such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, this is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.
These are the same subjects, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bulwark of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to keep people from ever making that decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow.
Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since its nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman of Reid later said that he hadn't talked to Clinton yet if she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, being lackeys and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for presidential office.
Treats wants a nude calendar for "women and men"
The Treats Magazin works with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine differs from old school playboys because "playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he's of the opinion that the Calendar does.
"We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Anyone who doesn't adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Dialog and World Foundation.
The Kurdish Community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers to flee Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundred thousand," says the chairman of the association, Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish Community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany in the medium term, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the chairman of the association Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself receives refugees produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the federation complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevi cities.
Erdogan wanted to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
There is also a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics in Germany.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement is also afraid of many Turks fleeing abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a Gülen adherent destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near foundation Dialogue and Education, the "world."
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already presented before the coup the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany.
As of June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognised as being eligible for asylum (39,625).
In this uprising there are not those who fled from war, poverty, or lack of perspective.
Right to asylum according to the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
They understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
In 2021 the state election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not as stupid as it is so far: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites itself.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the electors, are on holiday.
Most holidaymakers in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting out voices, only effortlessly find out.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again have a campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition suitable.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, you can see from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the flourishing of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "we can do that," has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it's like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large rallies; Merkel Bundestag electoral circle is located in the northeast.
But the target group wasn't right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxony there than Mecklenburgers and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it is also a pity for no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual campaign stands on market places and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.
According to Kokert, this only plays a "subordinate role."
The Union has also noticed that in the countryside it is crumbling the base, that it has to make a great effort to find a link to the people again.
You are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU elector Kokert to his comrades is self-entlarved: "They must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used."
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly committed campaign.
In the last survey, the Social Democrats were 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD clearly won 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the state parliament.
They make the holiday need a modern virtue and largely transfer their election campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign," the country's chairman Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners go on a search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is currently cruising through the Mecklenburg Lakes with a houseboat and finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27-Renovation: Restaurants suffer from blocking
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being refurbished.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be relocated to the south as planned at half-time, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
It is also praised for the cooperation of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the setting up of auxiliary entrances.
Since the construction site has moved south on Monday and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has thus been restored, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
The citizens can now drive the B 27 on both sides again from Ofterdingen.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Head of Office, responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain struggled with more traffic noise, because many of the trails were seeking and were more familiar with their navigation than with the signage.
Which caused some trucks to fray in residential areas.
Since also the speed limits were not respected, the municipality demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
Two to three per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest was at 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become calmer.
For the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small comfort that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led them to drop sales, lets anyone you ask see through.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "final customer," i.e. who produce for other companies, have little consequences for the renovation.
At Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline," but also admits that of course "the running customer is missing."
The restaurants along the road are the most packed.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
It's a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants had hit it hard.
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro sales.
He estimates the loss of sales to be "far over 50 percent."
The road renovation had "rejected its operation by two years."
He had to dismiss half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, the President of the Government Jörg Schmidt replied to Göhner's question as to whether there could be a financial compensation, stating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other counties, where such a generous treatment was handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests now stop by less frequently because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't get here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the BSE and bird flu crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
Laws are constantly being screwed in the name of combating terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Compromiser.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package.
You don't overwhelm anyone.
Other further points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I'm taking part in this, too.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was interested in results and in a "realizable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière let a little time pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: The fact that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and security personnel is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière starts a second attempt for proposals that were not yet to be made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to unbutton the German passport for jihadists with double citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He nevertheless considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance at all with the coalition partner.
De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
They have it in part: he plans fast procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before the deportation.
Refugees who are targeted to be brought to the country should first have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
When it comes to tolerance for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some of them even worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also seem unfulfilled and leave questions unanswered.
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of patient persons, for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about safety in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that deeply occupied people could not be excluded even during election times.
Internal security has become an enormous focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, the two parties have gone up.
First a nasty dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy idea collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière struggles here too for conciliatory tones.
He doesn't agree with a departure from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Doing it again is not a good idea.
And in a burka ban, he had constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "mutable" for the coalition partner has yet to show itself.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the topic of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first carefully signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen's still gonna get through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery numbers are rising worldwide.
But not all markets are running smoothly.
The recall action is a whirlwind of a term.
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with deliveries more restrained.
Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel affair, thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again burdened the total sales, as reported by the company listed in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the same month of the previous year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the same month of the previous year.
In Germany's home market, deliveries dropped by almost one-sixth.
Brand Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there had been a "changed economic environment" in the context of a buy-back.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, a spokesperson explained that the British vote to leave the EU had also been strained.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas affair escalated first, there is also a minus.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony still comes through the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be booked.
Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
Following the conversion of the vehicles, there was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the conversion, the car manufacturer issued the customer with a "guarantee-like" certificate, but did not speak of a "guarantee," as it was called on Friday in company circles.
The reason was legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Differences are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deteriorations in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant for type approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee," as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the conversion, customers might come into a workshop with engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer's interest to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal being insecure with regard to possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee."
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand fine interest from wealthy savers - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros in giro or daily money accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers "should not be afraid to pay their penalty rate for their savings banks."
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
From September onwards, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will demand this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros to giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
For some time he has been guarding 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"They are in my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the head of the bank.
"I can't lie down for every million 4000 euros."
He now passes on the costs according to the polluter-pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth one," said the bank board.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance causes considerable costs for all banks."
It is not possible to carry it on its own "in the long term."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
With penalty interest for deposits of three million euros or more, the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay charges for deposits throughout the country, and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
One banker said that there is "a clientele that is a little more luxuriant of the fortune " at Lake Tegernsee.
"This can become a problem for a small bank" when they keep free money.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The cooperative association Bayern "currently no other banks are known to charge a replacement for deposits from private customers," said Spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), explained: "The threshold to go into the negative vis-à-vis the private customer is very, very high."
The competition was tough and there was a threat of investors' emigration to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be able to take advantage of this in the wide range.
Destination records: who buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to sow it under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMenMiddle Ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the widespread resurrection of records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and bully, before I stop, hold my hands and say something definite like, "So, let's take a closer look."
So let's take a look at it.
Even though Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings that once were independent sellers - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, who I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), undress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are related to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media horn, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.
From the conversations that I have had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the boom in followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took off on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It's an easy way to be spiritually engaged.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member flies from a pile of records.
A poll by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month haven't heard it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those buying a record do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried while browsing through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older ones, coming in slowly.
Fopp, who devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drones from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
None of them look very lonely, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more of a window shop than a big shop.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... it's driven away with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to pattern the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think they're buying a Crosley record player.
To the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But given that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research showed that YouGov's results were correct, at least in record stores in Soho, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street's record shops and sheets, while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie, 30-year-old fake moderator who questions over the shoulders of no suspect middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
More scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was for a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be entitled to tear down 72 temporary shops where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and medical risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais Prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the tearing down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian stated that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, of whom the youngest are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia Disappointment: Martin remains militant
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, Tony Martin does not want to let himself be defeated.
"I keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"To be honest, it's hard for me to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to calmly analyse the reasons for the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time-trial World Championships in Qatar in October.
"I'm gonna look at everything that we've changed lately."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time World Champion who had lost more than three minutes to the 54.5 km Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday.
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund misses semi-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: the world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, could only perform her impact once and seemed powerless compared to the previous laps.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (no. 10).
In 2000, Tommy Haas won a silver medal in Sydney, Germany.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of summer games had last been there in 1992.
A German duo has never been in a single Olympic semi-final.
Group increases at start-up for live video game transmissions
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up beam, which specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft didn't tell us how much money is going to go for the takeover on Thursday.
Beam started with its offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face enemies and provide equipment.
The game giant Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The start-up's staff, which has so far been based in Seattle, Washington, USA, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, the acquisition should not change anything for the customers.
According to Microsoft, beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by online retailer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google mother alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters: In various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are supposed to transfer speed sinners particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking Enforcement Trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident centers, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or bridges to be refurbished with a temporary speed limit, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary lightning camera.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as pass-through bans according to time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the raised condition you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also bullet-proof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also being used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain gets silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
Britain's impressive performance at the 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday night at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, rear-tracking, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had come a difficult way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
This flop will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks of GB bounce off for fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. felt as if they were running on moving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau rushed over in the corner.
With four minutes left, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right hand corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A superb Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua read a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the retiring and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning to play.
That's right.
GB made fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fijan gap...for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant mid-play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Sea islanders, whose fans sang, swung flags and danced in the grandstand.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-tip with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the lawn.
Earlier that day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a close semi-final match - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the coach's cancer to row victory
There will be no more emotic gold than these games, and that means something.
From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hard hooves that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who sat on the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was present when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the second row without a tax woman in succession, the first women in the history of British sport who laid such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th unbeaten commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the kind of triumph.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he's risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It's changing the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual and trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
We wouldn't be without Robin, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much reserve.
We were very trapped right now.
Helen called "Stay in trial, stay in trial."
It's really important not to let yourself get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't going to do something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better," she said.
Exemplified clarity for 31 years
Ruppert Göller, Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitensteingruppe," retires.
The association is considered to be "bayernweit exemplary."
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago it was said in the original tone in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio.
A little later, the Water Forum paid tribute to the government of Lower Franconia.
The work of the Veite stone group was "bayernweit als exemplary."
Behind all of this is Rupert Göller, who was a member of the Zweckverband for 31 years, 28 of whom were managing directors.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group, headquartered in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
==Geography==Baunach has an area, , of .
For further cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterwatchman in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Special Purpose Association in 1988.
"Its tasks have been very diverse and have ranged from water management and maintenance to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions, to emergency operations on weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), land purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tank (1999), the new purchase of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There had been no stoppage and there had always been innovations, because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veite stone group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.
He had received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterman, and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view he described the well construction and the restructuring of the special purpose association.
But the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank near Kirchlauter on a 3rd January.
Here will have to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
The soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses herself to other parents concerned: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera."
When the illness was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
However, the now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: if I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at Milan's Scala, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Beziehungsstat in Bargteheide - Man shoots at life mate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at 10.45 a.m. on Friday in an apartment house in Bargteheide (district Stormarn) and fatally injured her.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his life's partner," said a police spokesperson.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him is wanted publicly.
Now nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and bald.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears baldness.
I don't want the man to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
At first, the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to provide information about the incident or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a homicide."
"That's all we're saying right now," said a police spokesperson in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, there was a Special Operations Command (SEK) at the scene.
Steel - Lighting for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens threatening the sector from green electricity support are off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy surcharge for existing plants for so-called in-house electricity production in the German steel industry remains, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that after two years of tough negotiations we were finally able to achieve this."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers to pay for the use of gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced will an EEG surcharge of 20 percent be applied.
However, this was not raised in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of electricity.
This largely establishes the status quo of the current regime.
Gabriel's successful effort was particularly important for the steel industry.
"With regard to our 'steel is the future' campaign, this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets are also to be considered in the reform of emissions trading," explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation worsened further as the world's largest producer country, China, threw large quantities of steel on the world market in the face of weak domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring the situation has relaxed a bit.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel have had an effect, and on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened up.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices would have stagnated again rather.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closure of individual plants.
At the end of 2015, around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent reduction in crude steel compared to the same month of the previous year, as reported by the German Steel Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased for the second month in a row.
Production has been two percent below the previous year's level since the beginning of the year.
The association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good for seniors
Ursel Kipp has accompanied singing all her life: as a young girl, she was in the school choir, in the teaching department she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive overall, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through being together regularly, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp also made this experience in her choir: "To talk and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs don't get out of breath so quickly in everyday life, too.
Even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on the elderly, says Ursula Lenz of the German Association of Senior Workers Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people suffering from dementia remember long past events.
When singing, the head is also required to have a special performance, explains Lenz.
Focusing on one's own voice and a predetermined rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice this way not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join them.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the parish or the church head directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet search.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cat to screams of the young
Biologists in Hannover have investigated the effect of calling baby cats on adult animals.
To their surprise, the mice did not leave the males cold - however, unlike the females, they always behaved the same way.
Female cats can detect the level of excitement of kittens on the small mice.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who think they are in great need, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the mice of less and more excited juveniles are either not perceptible or not relevant to the males," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were played by little ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, reacted differentiatedly to the screams," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the loudspeaker when this call was played by the more excited kittens.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football match takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt.
Before the duel of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempted overthrow in July, the government stated that the daily life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
There is also no stopping before football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to this, the Sükür, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, still applies until October, in fact this has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nocturnal "democracy-watching" in public places throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
Like the whole country, sport is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas workers' club are traditionally not among the president's friends.
But what unites the majority of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With cup winner "Gala" it will especially arrive again on Lukas Podolski.
In the past season, the Kölner proved his sporting value: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as a top scorer of his club.
==References====External links==*Official website
The newspaper "Fanatics" cheered him: "He was the best in the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion came to a conciliatory conclusion.
==Career statistics====References====External links==*Official website
==References====External links==
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
==References====External links==
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig-Gatekeeper King.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
After the coup attempt, Gomez had signed a contract with the AC Florenz and had only been loaned to Besiktas to not return due to the political situation in the country after his European Championship.
"If Mario wants to come to us, all he has to do is say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Director Fikret Orman.
To do this, however, the striker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman stated: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other athletic sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to be the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julia Yefimova, who had sued her right to start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was mercilessly whistled and booed at her start (100 meters breast).
There was a bizarre scenery: with a smile on her face, she was still strutted into the hall and provoked with her appearance.
When it was established that she wouldn't get gold, the audience burst into a jubilee storm.
However, there are many other athletes who, despite their doping past, compete at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic Champion and former World Champion have run even faster than before, he is the world's number one in over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m relay/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to take a six-month lock in 2010 after she was proven to be taking the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the forbidden stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the knowing intake and was banned for six months.
The four biggest litters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic Champion and twice World Champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and was closed for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt stated.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently denied so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later, after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old also had to give up Olympia silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title due to testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games as a result of a judgment of the International Court of Sports CAS.
==References====External links==*Official website
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion found evidence of the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement, the ban on the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital but had already been able to leave the hospital again.
She had planned her return journey for the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, says Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok's capital city, initially exploded on Thursday night in a night-out district.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosives went up again, and according to the authorities, another person was killed.
Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.
According to the police, a taxi driver was injured in the detonation near Patong beach, which was popular with holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the IED was blown up in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injuries.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings bear the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.
"We assume this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it was the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurrection movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Over the past few days, the authorities have received secret service indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police ordered their officials throughout the country to increase security around important government buildings, airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.
In Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bomb explosions that have taken place, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be strictly followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, it is advised not to travel to these provinces before they are needed.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This also gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, keeps itself benefiting from having led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to cope with the uprising of Muslim rebels that has been hovering in the extreme south of the country for years either.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people had also been killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "identitary movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"In the 'Identitarian Movement', we see indications for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said Head of Constitutional Protection Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are defamed in an extremist manner.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitäre Bewegung" (Identitarian Movement) is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural delusion," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "loss of one's identity through alienation."
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identities."
Maaßen said that his authority had closely coordinated the decision with the state offices.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of constitutional protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists would do that.
It's not a believable commercial for your own business.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Most recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts between the "identities" and AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point of view.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain persons who are extremist, and becomes so extremist.
The decisive factor is therefore whether such persons have controlling influence on the party.
This is not apparent.
In view of the significant increase in the number of rights-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he was not yet talking about new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or small groups are forming, which are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, there is no evidence of a nationwide or pan-European governance of right-wing terrorism.
The previous groups had emerged at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed his concern at the fact that many attacks took place on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That is the concern.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or Left, which then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is demonstrated by Robel Kiros Habte's courageous appearance at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily out of view in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with 48 seconds behind him and finished 59th in 59th place.
But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start from the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most atholians run in Äthopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal."
Based on a "welfare belly," the English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Eric Moussambani's race attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a run of over 100 meters of freestyle.
Moussambani was freneticly cheered at that time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
A seat in the forefront of the stunning architecture of the Los Angeles Central Library

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neuer Platz has been robbed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business at 5.30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at around 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump sees the threat of electoral defeat not so narrowly
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election to the U.S. president doesn't work out, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll go on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he wouldn't care: "In the end, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, said Trump.
He described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle seems to be great.
The post office plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle as well.
In the near future, the Group intends to start trading with the transporter.
From next year onwards, the Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
For months, the company has been investigating whether it is going to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies.
Post-CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always requests, for example from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the Bonn-based company plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In the post-owned production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and plan a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK made it possible to assume that the longer the promised successes will not be achieved, the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes even more uncertain.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world-wide number five of the industry is facing a new personnel start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert has already left the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the Executive Board is already taking over the former Executive Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, the company informed.
He is to officially take over the role of "Corporate Spokesman" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
The company cited "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation as the reason for the resignations.
A company spokesman on Friday didn't want to mention details.
Whoever will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investor circles said on Friday that shareholders were disappointed at the lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring, however, are still not to be seen after 5 years," they said.
In view of the last poor GfK business figures, each shareholder becomes restless at some point.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," they said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the Company had not been able to stop its loss ride in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year.
With regard to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent at 721.2 million euros.
Profit in the second quarter was mainly affected by the company's declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-off of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience division, resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In the event of an accident involving 43 senior citizens as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
According to her information, the 66-year-old driver of a coach from a travel company in Eisenach had to avoid a truck that was partly on the opposite track.
The bus came to the right of the road and slipped into a ditch, as a spokesperson of the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance came to the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken back to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum by a bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water will be 3.44 euros for the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl from 1 October 2016 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an overarching calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4,37 euros per cubic metre.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that these waste water plants are undercover.
On the basis of legal principles, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost-covering.
As of October 1, 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their pockets.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The serious increase in fees was due to the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small facilities with a very small waste water attack, ranging from 6800 to 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, the renovation and repair costs of all three plants were incurred to a considerable extent, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water plant Azendorf due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pump plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from scratch and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses came the continued care and maintenance costs, which have to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still well below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the small waste water attack in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance "carry through fully."
Schmidt added that in the past 20 years the market community had been spared from the high maintenance costs of the waste water plants.
In Steinhäuser's view, the situation for these plants would remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the waste water utility association Friesenbachtal could not be extended by these plants because they are in deficit facilities.
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, price increases were observed for the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, custom-turning tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past, in which they were accused that the app would promote blackface or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested a filter to some users this week, which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Yellow Face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a major problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread through the photos, wrote that the filter was "injuring and mildly unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been pulled to the degraded extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trip wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - could rather assume to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she doesn't have a diverse representation of people with different skin colors in her staff so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with different skin colors who work there but aren't in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a human resources manager who focuses on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, for her part, that she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK."
Military leadership falsifying ISIS intelligence information, found committee of Congress
United States Central Command military personnel changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, reported a Congressional investigation committee in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committees and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command (Cencom) is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information typically nodded by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," quoted a newspaper article in the report.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail constant problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to lower the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports into the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed information while the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Inspector-General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," stated the highest-ranking Democrat in the committee, a member of the Adam B. Schiff House of Representatives, in a statement.
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morality among analysts, and "there was too little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they didn't find any evidence of White House intervention by the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon's Inspector General, who were received after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports of Congress, while the investigation of the Inspector-General was still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has had repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism about the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of differences of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only provided for a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker's team, according to government agencies, noted that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the state of war at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK ahead
One day after she scored three goals over Japan during a 6-1 win, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of the people who remember their gates.
She knows that, however: The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British women in first place, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win the first and second place respectively.
The first-placer will be a little longer out of the way for the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of the game on Saturday, the American women have caused a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they finished in the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three she had a hockey bat in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a US national player, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn't qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team, and things began to change for the better.
"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London we have now.
We've been able to rip the rudder around completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the tournament in the first half of the game with a backhand strike from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and luffed the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously scored a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a rapid season between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from crossbow shooter to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who was present for the first time at the Olympic Games and is a female swarm with dimples, could have been under these well-known names, which are broadcast to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencing.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournaments.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I should humbly make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely for the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the uneducated ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon-like tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "springboard."
Rising winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a series of falling movements (turning, pikes and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are rated according to the official Olympic program according to performance, difficulty and "flight time."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal seekers must go further, faster, higher and higher in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also another mocking goal in the television broadcast: the world's or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I myself find tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is upstairs.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
Women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; those of men on Saturday, also around 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.
If the increase in awareness can only be achieved through the angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male US tournaments recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to blow up.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in exchange of fire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have rocked the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses reported that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos in circulation about the protests, which are probably from the last or early of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now asking for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven to the vast expanses of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and these have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
One generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the Eritrean border are rising; a struggle for this tense, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of crawling.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they were gathering for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the Aeons, the Amharas, who come from Ethopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that too is changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, who make up around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly well-versed in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands of protests against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last few months, and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal displeasure.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked Tigray-led businesses and the hatred of the Tigray became more and more common on social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin ridge walk."
Donald Trump declares his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group was not meant seriously.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also brings his collaborators, who try to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant.
After making the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back in relation to Thursday's claim and insisted in interviews that he really didn't intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to attenuate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism hits Mr. Trump while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling survey scores.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already submitted sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he had strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared, "Of course, I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken up by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" depending on how the reaction turns out." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of disarming the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has taken an even more corrosive tone, as his polls have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead tour in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.
But while he is more focused on the attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal collaborators into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it a backbencher, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, where Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for presidential office.
Once displaced over the price from the market, Café returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices pushed him out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is excluded, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, then it's re-invention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new branch office, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also driven out of Williamsburg by prices," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would be on her way.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee on that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't have any resentment about the soap business taking over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we'll go back to their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice shop wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There's a chance the café is expanding into a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like returning home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a soft spot for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard," tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, unadulterated snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found this suitable for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been like lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pie for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways the country handled not to be the slalom land anymore.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: Mysterious food such as bread and casserole rolls became basic food, the casserole as "a wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried out, because a calorie-rich and nourishing satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen understanding.
During her research on the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition at noon," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943, among them - drove the country's eating habits like this.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary policymakers" and to meet the challenge of transforming pampa such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude, are tasty.
As he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully unreal.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolately prepared."
Many of the ways of dealing with food from the Great Depression era were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered: "She actually made people sick. "
There was the windbag incident.
After the dishes were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone plunged a little reluctantly a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe made a reference three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets," a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, has saved almost 60,000 people's lives.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to move people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
However, as a hero he never saw himself, according to Bild, "For me this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We are now eliminating the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims through the North Atlantic with a good 1 km/h - until today.
Greenland sharks do not have any offspring until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark slowly swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, with an average of just 1,220 meters in an hour.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.
But this slow lifestyle seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal "Science" at any rate about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would become stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the Ice Sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the life style of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
Still, these sharks make prey: researchers found the remains of a seal in the stomach of an animal, while another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and seek cadavers that stagger down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sharks that caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had noticeably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons experiments, so it probably celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters should be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females will only have offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks seem to allow at least one and a half centuries of breeding.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.
The fact that such methuseals live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a thrift flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives therefore more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Base in double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues relating to building.
With relief, the panel adopted the communication from Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin."
After the real estate, parceling and development questions could be clarified and the applications for surveying could be submitted, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the land to interested parties in the residential building areas "Strasslweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - extension section 1).
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential municipality of Schönau appeal to young families and rugged senior citizens alike.
As it was said, those who wanted to build can now report to the town hall, the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the parcels at its September meeting.
In order to also be able to respond to requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises, together with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan, which was newly established in the spring of this year, into sub-areas.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, for example, the already designated industrial area is extended by two plots towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms that have been relocated from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets at IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions can continue to operate financial transactions throughout the EU from London.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been allowed in the UK.
That's what big U.S. banks are using right now.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority, EIOPA and the Risk Board, speak.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it is less efficient in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than its competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a Mercer management consultancy ranking, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg ranked 19th, Dublin ranked 33rd and Paris ranked 37th.
Although quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.
However, despite Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers think.
The balance of power also speaks for this: According to the figures of Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking sector in London at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt it was 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
One U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it under the Hepatits C case with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million compensation for the violation of two patents by Merck associated with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of misconduct on Mercks, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was brought on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to waive the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property for laboratory work that Sofosbuvir was responsible for, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed troops say that they have regained complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left it, said a spokesperson of the group on Friday.
Syria's Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the exodus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city.
They have liberated over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharpan Darwish told Reuter, the Manbij Military Councillor allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently doing clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned almost USD 5.3 million in Redehonorar; the former Foreign Minister gave a USD 3 million income from Simon & Schuster for her book on her term at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for Vice President, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, together with his wife, Anne Holton, has published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You're on the move," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter regarding the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business dealings and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already jumped on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republicans ask Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday, stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, who would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, to meet Trump to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subject to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had "fear" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons tax return of 2015 showed that they received only USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into man-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuders.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, together with the US nature protection, has intensified its support by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed the ... toolkit, we have seen a change of attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants away from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide's Managing Director, Damian Bell, in a statement.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a torch and blowing it into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned towards the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust at chilipuders into the air.
A touch quite usually already out to chase out the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on the banks of the St. Goar Rhine
Usually, the St. Goar investment projects of traders with a kiss hand take on - because the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the City Council unanimously rejected the proposal for a new sale kiosks on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"Basically, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli prefix was removed according to "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli prefix, as it "had demanded" Arab guests according to one employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country code list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and extinguished?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him " as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was "an intentional decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the prefix be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were appalled and dismayed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more shameful.
There's no need to explain.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big response on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it "would have given in" to the alleged demands of Arab guests.
"Shame yourself," it was said in another article, which pointed out that the hotel, which is located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident a "mistake" and "apologies" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the quick list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesperson of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to pull the students apart, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti spray on walls against provisional President Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after protesters in masses went out on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to dismiss her.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the lifting of sanctions increased the annual turnover between Moscow and Tehran by 70.9 percent.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest in business in the country has increased strongly on the part of Russian companies, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are opening up existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5% and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The trade boom was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian embassy abroad issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year, will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: Drink market in Waldbröl
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With the help of a gun, three darkly dressed people, who had mummed their faces, demanded cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-colored VW golf.
The police don't tell us how much money has been taken.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the car park entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who made observations at the time of the crime (around 7:45 p.m.) related to the robbery should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Play and fun during summertime
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social-educational day group/social group work of the Children's Protection Association Nagold with their carers on their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
The lively group was accommodated during the first school holiday week in the quietly located leisure home Hardtwäldle.
Several full-day excursions were on the agenda.
On the one hand we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special tour of children in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splash.
Culinary, children and caregivers were spoiled with their own prepared personal food such as Sauren Spätzle, Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
Workshops have been used to beat up, create beautiful jewels made of pearls and stones, or make a Roman mill game out of wood.
Other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "colorful evening."
On the day of the journey home the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home contentedly.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Door of Mercy
The minstrants from the chaplainry unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage to Rome of all the minstrants in probably two years, the administrative round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the Bishop's City of Freiburg was finally chosen, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the open gate of mercy at the Freiburg Münster.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set out.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' crosses and blessed the pilgrims' blessing.
From Horb, a train drove to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage from the Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But even on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches kept resting to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim's songbook.
For the nights, the parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage finishes Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to descend at first about 500 meters of altitude in humid heat and then climb again.
The reward earned was a barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went to the closing stage to Freiburg.
Visiblely relieved and happy, the minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in the Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-worker Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home when Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced for glory at the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio last night when the British team defended the London title in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The young boy made the legend proud, when he stormed home to take a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the World Railway Championships in London in March, despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph alongside Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he fell deliberately on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags in the grandstand."
We've met as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the shape of Kenny it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
For Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - this would mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's what Hoy would be like.
Kenny will take part next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in the focus.
He had argued with officers before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Mildavie advanced in the women's competition, which will continue and finish tomorrow, in a world record time of 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a host of medals.
After a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bullying allegations as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.
The future of Portland's smelting industry is questionable as a result of the repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total power generation.
In 2014, Arcoa closed Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting plant in Portland is losing money and is risking closure.
This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is owned by a majority of Alcoa and Alumina joint ventures, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland will continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity from the smelter," the company informed.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" that should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"From this point of view, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of the strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual budget of $ 187 million in "Expectation of termination."
Alcohol said that the decision to book out the contracts did not affect the "ability of Alcoa to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter."
The U.S. company said that in 2010 it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of explaining why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover's revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian's like?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets her sister's cover and ends with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of an cartoon rabbit on a broadcast site at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover was concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on view in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a size that is more like a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of advertising were from the 832 pages of the Waltz).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "famous fashioners" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar prizewinner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good snapchat video (even if all of that applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't appeal to everyone.
With their reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticized her and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the displeasure seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your primer from Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's on Reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Municipal Law Centres Deflect 160,000 People a Year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is concerned with the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogization and the like - are already being rejected when they seek free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-exploited, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of Queensland's community centers, James Farrell, said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the Federal Government's decision were not lifted.
"Queensland's municipal law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people from important services you need will be rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families who go through divisions, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this elevation shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut funding by 30 percent, which means that thousands of people in need from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately, so that the people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centers and their client communities, as well as the Palaszczuk government investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged after employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inaction after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had targeted a gun on an employee in February while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini stated that he had waited for months for the matter to be resolved internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, " pulled a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee throat," Bordini stated in his charge.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment People - gun owners and gun friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's Press Spokesperson Hope Hicks could not be reached for a statement.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys carried out by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to govern in the north, this is not possible according to the survey results in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good chances of continuing to represent the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party would thus be just ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would reach 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the state parliament with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens have returned to the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary election (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
At 14 percent, the AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two high resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "office in the pocket format."
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit torturingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one knew in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, albeit not for Nokia.
The Finns' mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere to be online, this is today for a lot of people everyday.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion units were sold, including 555 million of Samsung and Apple alone.
The worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-run business of the countless app providers and the telecommunication groups.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple's boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple's winning move began, and today the iPhone is the Group's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the look-out.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian providers such as Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks 88 times a day at his cell phone.
"We all need to learn how to remove the smartphone," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for personnel at the Siemens Board of Directors.
Permanent accessibility is now considered both a curse and a blessing.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth, and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2 built in the middle of the world's two most frequented catwalks.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding display blocking
According to one of the software manufacturers, for companies that make money with online advertising attempts to bypass ad blocking are equivalent to a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockages on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads to make it more difficult to detect ad blockages that are part of the ad page.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams spokesperson wrote that "this kind of back-and-back fight between the display-blocking open source community and the surroundings has been underway since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company has entered the fight for social media is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook's investment in such a step seems worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences tool" to give people more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we are planning to address the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a dull tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
Woman in case of suspected suicide on Swiss highway overridden
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit on a highway in the early morning hours of Thursday by a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police declared in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, tried to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but some have still not been identified, said the police, calling on them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person walked in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian would walk on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere, could have had earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly continued to spin.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once presumably habitable, the Venus -- in the course of several billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left behind -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and led too little participation in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach's vision and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of participation in decisions that influence the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches, Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and placed first in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches scored a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and dropped five points behind the Wild for a second Wildcard spot at the Western Conference.
As Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike
Labor struggles with regard to remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all parties to the dispute sit at the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will start early next year to re-address the problems.
The unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group has reduced its rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10-percent decline for Onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries, as it streamlines its business activities as a result of its mega-collaboration with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which has been exacerbated by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps the astronomers to understand why stars rotate in the cluster at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are related to the formation of planets.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system by comparing our results with other star clusters," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which arose about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebul compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star cluster of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us about what we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
Tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was named the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract brought him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back for a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he has achieved several milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the glorious hall of baseball.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was blocked for 211 games due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect of having received performance-promoting funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league might even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played for 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez, sufficantly at the time.
Even his farewell days do not run silently.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi added.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and who is said to be related to Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy statements from fans of the Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang in the 4-9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Catched: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping events.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping events became known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-metre runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - these news come to an end just before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The CAS International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the 50 m freestyle forerunners.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and to hold a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning the athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio the news of the positive sample was leaked at Danekova, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT, "that this was an incredible shock."
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT the B-probe is said to have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister, Bojko Borisov, immediately voiced criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping-affected nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday also the case "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days earlier positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both contest the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the case of Danekowa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The international association IAAF had forbidden the whole Russian team to start except for one exception due to systematic dopings, and the Kenyan runners also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous crimes in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for doping scammers," he said.
Sun had been tested positively for stimulant trimetazidin at the Chinese Championships in 2014, but only had to sit down for a three-month lock.
Datenklau: So perfidious hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware currently target companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an attack with extortion software at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes several times.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already targeted for ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to the observations of malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extorted ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing an alarmingly fast evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place frighteningly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it specifically searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the extortioners.
In order to get the end encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop business altogether, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
Managers find it difficult to reject the perpetrator's claim in the face of a standstill in operation.
The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with the extortionists and came to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing their work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software builder to the actual extortioners.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then seek more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"The criminals usually hire spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company's IT managers in the malware bytes survey trust to be able to fend off Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators threaten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also pick up completely new targets on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating system could well be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it doesn't seem tight at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off somewhat.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests available, but there are the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: The seat surfaces of the backrest can be folded up like a Kinosessel and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should, however, do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version "Executive."
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Wizard (working until Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the lane-holding wizard.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects."
The main beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign recognition and reduces speed if necessary.
However, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets lie under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.
The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
If you don't want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and suitable car for everyday use.
Airline is not liable: Fall on Passenger Bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court argued that liability is only conceivable in the case of risks typical of air transport (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Case of illness: When does the organizer pay
Sick vacationers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to have the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family was severely ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their vacation to Turkey.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly polluted the sea water.
The family felt that the trip had been defective - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs did not succeed in court.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was fine.
So he did not violate his information duties, according to the verdict.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion with each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state had to react calmly and decisively to terrorist threats at the same time.
It is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this would increase the security and also strengthen the support of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces' personnel, "on an average four-digit scale over several years."
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, weapons law is to be amended in such a way that it is particularly difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
According to de Maizières, the last much discussed confidentiality obligation for doctors should be respected.
However, in his dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to find solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said with regard to mental disorders, for example.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
To persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD CEO Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism.
"That was a slap for the snipers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burka and the abolition of dual nationality.
He felt that a general ban on full concealment was a constitutional problem.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
One could talk about rules, for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green CEO Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate energy and ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Flot spells and an intensification of the right of residence do not bring the people in this country any more security."
Improved traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It is regularly on the bypass - here a picture of November.
But this should change: the right-hand lane should be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic traffic every evening on the surrounding road when driving over the motorway (A43).
Next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit, the road company extends the right-hand lane by 700 meters.
Drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Street to the right.
The big advantage is that traffic is split up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On a working day, the back of the road reaches the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the eye of the needle on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is steered only one-lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt about a quarter of a century ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to record heavy duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated working-day traffic jam will last, the competent national company cannot say.
However, years are to be expected: the bridge has an official residual useful life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-wing lane, the state enterprise deliberately chose the less traffic time during the school holidays, because it is to be expected with disabilities.
The traffic will pass the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Journey: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the Waldschule attended the play "The Invisible House."
The association Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's allows young people with a migrant and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a presentation of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the production in the Kleiner Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migrant and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most of the class's young people came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were still able to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The club Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has turned the star-sniffing guckers in the south-west of Germany in the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited to observe the celestial spectacle because of clouds and rain, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the observatory Welzheim, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we will see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star sheds are perseids, which with 216000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning there is already far before the alarm clock no longer to think of sleep.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel that their sleep is often or permanently not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the Board of Management of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
Many people find it particularly unsatisfactory or inadequate to sleep through, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Association of General Physicians with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioural factors, as well as medication, can be behind this.
The sleep disorder is often the expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common, especially in the event of depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are dependent on each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can lie down badly, wake up every two to three hours and start thinking about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to a doctor with a sleep disorder?
Those who do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look quite different: One is knocked off, tired, sleepless, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavior therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, emphasizes that sleep physicians who are left behind hardly exist in Germany.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises Weeß.
He can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who's gonna go to the sleep lab, and what's happening?
For example, in case of snoring with leprosy, in case of morbid daytime fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't sleep for lunch," Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a noseglasses, a chest strap and a probe on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeper.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a few adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleep and rising times, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you begin to calculate immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler commented on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the Doha Short Railway World Championships and set his first world record at the same time.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler via Facebook has turned himself against his critical ex-team colleagues.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000€ bonus and a jungle king 150,000€ no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page on the night of Friday.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, while the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at or even do the doping.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported by the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA) nine months before his first launch.
That's the way it should be with countries.
"Whoever cannot be controlled by independent controllers of the WADA/FINA for a certain time before World Championships/OS must not participate," demands the Wahl-Hamburger, who now operates an ice cream parlor.
Airport: gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 were arrested by the police in Düsseldorf.
The suspects had committed several baggage and luggage thefts as a gang.
At around 9.30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the policemen from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year, and had done so in a community, part-time and particularly professional way.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had taken over 15,000 euros in total.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between a rest of the cobblestones: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like this at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
On the facade of a gray house someone sprayed "ugly!"
Opposite a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here by 2017.
Articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, however, are preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
Reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin-based senator Henkel in particular had repeatedly advocated a hard action by the police against the project, called the area a "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police, according to official statements, patrolled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers left under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before the late day.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
They share concerns about increasing rents and gentrification with the residents of the house projects.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who mostly wanted police protection from vandalising leftists.
The ditch opened by the Berlin senator and the police between squatters and their neighbors doesn't seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which also today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupation and the housing projects born from it have been part of the neighbourhood for a long time: in 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, among them almost the entire Mainz road very close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainzer had been evicted in a real street battle under a large police mission, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still partly inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world in recent years: now residents from GDR times and former squatters share their neighbourhoods with them.
This is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: They can be recognized by cast-in windows or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.
No other street was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left autonomy."
One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the crime is caused by property damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, can't speak of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is appeasement: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they certainly have not been.
Even the famous burning cars have not been in the Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from one another than elsewhere."
Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Rigaer Straße - and remained.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, the politics and the media, who suddenly claimed interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road is still being taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former building gaps that the old inhabitants are displacing.
"In the end, these are condominiums that aren't interesting to many here - people who aren't so well stocked live here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what do you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for attracted people who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Those who move here should be aware of this - just like those who move into a pub neighborhood, can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the administrative team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group on refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine customer from the working group suggests that volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the egg-legged wool milk sow, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mocking than the many desired areas of responsibility - had meant that the administration wanted to write the job out.
An administrative expert was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, a legendary wool milk sow.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50-percent job for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers will be on the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must house the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.
The costs of the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find any private housing.
It doesn't work so far, according to Deuschle, it depends on private apartments.
Therefore, community homes must be proved, as it is so beautifully called.
So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good," reports Regine customer.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do charitable work - and this motivates and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive visibility.
This is "no occupational therapy."
Activity, however, does not mean just work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here too, administration and volunteers are coming in.
It was crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures was a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and that they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Whoever at some point develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach must not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says the customer honestly, "people who can't do anything at all." Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always also to motivate others.
All this is already a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: After the recent events, are they afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some people may call naive." However, a residual risk could and does not want to exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents were also the subject of the refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would discredit them completely.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, primary and voluntary staff must look for activities on the spot and in the region.
They always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
Politics are afraid to answer this question clearly.
Actually, it's unfair to put helpers on the spot.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the previous people in a rational way.
These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
