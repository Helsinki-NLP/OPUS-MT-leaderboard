What should it do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery."
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has sometimes "knocked off" members of the new ČSSD council, as they master the notorious slang that has become established in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The encoded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era by Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark with regard to those new concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a newcomer to Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "patent vocabulary."
But also the councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golfhole."
"This is the only expression of those you are presenting to me here, which I use from time to time."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of Slang."
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS Election Congress, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Socialists and Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort," "the largest golf hole in Prague," "go to the pastry shop," "napsacks of bulls," "treason of the capital" and "plate."
Three Prague Councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the discussion first, but then did not even take the listener.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other, I don't judge them."
"For me, it is important how we understand each other in our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not realize in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole."
"This is the Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plashý correctly as a tunnel Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know who Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plashý even suspects where this figure is to be found and thus what it means to "go to the pastry shop."
"I think that this means going to some Prague gastronomy company," is pretty close to Plashý's solution to the mystery, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he asserts that he had gained this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
Judging by the test participants, there does not seem to be any similar naturalised slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call by name, sometimes we use abbreviation or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his party comrades called salopp "Hulda."
"In school I was called Bříza (birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is kind to the party comrades the "Opa" or less friendly the "Old," the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by machinations at the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in the inner-partisan language.
Hulínský allegedly doesn't like to be called "Hulda," but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the president of Prague.
His nickname "Doktor der Gummiknüppel-Righte" is allegedly related to the fact that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong more to the older generation, they do not find work - for health reasons, for example, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she becomes strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women are also spared this, as they help with their work and give birth to children," a religious sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, which cares for more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in a special home.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure."
And for this reason, he issued a brochure to stop the "witches' pursuit. "
This thing has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "DerStandard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured petroleum on her and simply lit her.
This incident was also reported by the server BBC.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil was inflamed, which was used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "push out an evil spirit " from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here without regard for their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eaters of human souls are a danger in the past and today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least strives to defuse the witch hunt, last year the Gambian president mixed up the president himself properly.
"President Yahya Jammeh started a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, because they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called on shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, forcibly kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and took them to the President's farm in Kanila," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink a waste of plants with hallucinogenic effect, but also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive their stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - yet he pays higher rent
An older man, who is under siege, is leaving the RPG Byty Client Centre of the "carbon baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison term.
All three of them have just increased their rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation."
Instead of 3500 krona monthly rent, the son is expected to cover 4100 krona next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen in the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he tips annoyed with his finger on the new lease of the son, to whose signature he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed it," he explains half out of tune and half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which referred to the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December for them to publish instructions on how to counter such contracts.
But the man just waves off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a major "deregulation laboratory."
After New Year's Eve, this deregulation is ahead of most apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-oriented rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock full this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"Rent 2011," so a special touch field lights up on the touch screen.
Shortly typed and the device spits out a number sheet.
Hardly have we deciphered the number "157" and already it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room doesn't seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new rental contracts will flutter into the mailboxes for most tenants of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letters a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client center has been open since November 18th.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's just the beginning," the ladies answer after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, MEP Lubomír Zaorálek, from Ostrava, from the ČSSD, took up this issue quite loudly, no wonder the newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even a bad WC glasses they could change," the man mentioned at the beginning breathes himself.
Up to now, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the counter to see if they really get the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new lease by 15 December, are also expected to benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
Until now, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded by requests.
"From yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent were here in 2011 because of this," the desk officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as wall panels where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties did not agree on the new rent, it would be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," RPG explains on its websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees, and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, 5,000 of which are left for me to eat, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employees become insecure.
Let's see.
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says to think.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic in 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of RPG Byty's housing portfolio, and - in the opinion of the homeowners, precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is estimated to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov a few bright red information appear in between.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square metre per month," read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent stays at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not bring rents up sharply, but will gradually take place within four and eight years.
What's more - the company is imposing another obligation: All revenues from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - above all - these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios come a whole series of well-known Brno buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is anxious that the project owners return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social program.
It is thus easier for civil engineers and architects to reconcile their demanding profession and child care.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of management, they were able to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (grants of CZK 2,8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment have been procured and for a period of 2 years qualified personnel and operation are provided.
After the funding has been used up (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to run the Minikindergarten 3 at its own expense for further years.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children are cared for by all-time qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten business is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although these are individual education and care, the programme content in the Mini-Kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool instruction, by the way, they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus eliminate the stress of late picking up the children from a far-away kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also emerging here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer clear benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs such as the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house with its organic forms was nicknamed "Knochenhaus."
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of sheds and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with fantastic lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
It is only on closer inspection that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and well thought-out order.
During the night, the entire façade looks even more sculptural, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and winding shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and groins.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the apartment house Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Especially on its drawing board were the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the Park of Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given the nickname "Knochenhaus" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "yawning house."
It is also said that at the very top of the building the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces, which was unique for the house at that time.
A little bit bizarre seems to be her 45-degree incline.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at that time and was by no means perplexed by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the relevant building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city's fathers were so horrified by the result that they demanded remedy.
Among other things, the Councillors also met with the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the district, Josep Batlló submitted a request for the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a parlour, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
By the basic elements of the conversion all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could comfortably chat without having to renounce a certain intimacy in confidential conversations.
In addition to a new façade, Gaudí's renovation also provided the house with a rather unusual roof and two further floors.
Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is disguised and the courtyards of light are also impressive.
The play of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The house Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can now be visited by anyone.
On the first floor is the most spacious and magnificent apartment made accessible to the public.
The homeowners only decided in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was discovered that this was a fairly profitable business, the tours were retained, and they were extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the monument is not a cardboard handle, it amounts to 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards receive 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Those who want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to make friends with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different desires than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the health status and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Just as important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves.
Typical example?
Latex mattresses are not well suited in a weekend home that does not heat regularly, as they need much longer to "get warm."
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned on a regular basis.
If they don't have enough ventilation canals in the core and are also lying on a solid plate, moisture gets wet: It is therefore not excluded that it forms under their mold.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the election.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Well, all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they couldn't sleep properly here anymore."
"For their worn shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these to people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why I got many hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among others the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco Foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimalizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it really nestles on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus.
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still calculate the length of the soles of your feet, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For convenience and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal width of the bed: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokomová, the guild master of the upholsterer and room outfitter, who has been devoted to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years and also presents this topic at technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is no choice but to mount the grates at different heights and that is by no means possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a feather skeleton should be 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be on the mould layer and the fine padding.
"With your hand or when you sit down, you must not feel the feathers," warns Helena Prokomová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and base like grown-up Siamzwillinge have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not shy away the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which one can easily remove and wash.
Even if mattress covers with zipper are usually made today, so that you get two halves after opening (very important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often seems like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get it out!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
They should also use the plate with ventilation holes (if none are already in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable slatted rusts with 14 to 18 spring strips (lamellas), always paying off rusts with a larger slatted number, i.e. from 28 or more spring strips, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebrae area and the possibility to regulate the slatted hardness.
On adjustable lamellar rust, no mattresses with feather skeleton belong, because they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special attachment of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press in the spring strips or even to angle them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in at once.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in men's mattresses.
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-heavy wing suspension systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point-heavy contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and proper rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here too a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm pillow, as for example the Scandinavians like it.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials or at least their admixtures.
The new magic word "organic" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor oil and soya oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"In the case of mattresses, organic means that their core consists of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Again, there is a difference between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract of birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets comfortably warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heel are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have 7000 crowns and more to cover.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT because they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattress with Visco foam for 11.990 CZK.
The second one is free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft in warmth, in cool environment it solidifies itself again.
Thus, it adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot cushions, which are intended to make the legs and vessels easier.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of one's own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, can also locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as in the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it should not be larger than a watch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and terror, so they look for ways and means to protect their children better.
Also for the price of impairing their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases such devices can be misused, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without knowing about it, but we haven't had a case like this."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box " and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"Even the mobile phones at first aroused great expectations with the parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned abductions, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be more widely used, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it acknowledges that similar devices can be helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"For more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and lie motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also do intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you just need to play a special software.
The problem with the current locating equipment is that it is either a matchbox size device that resembles trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There's always a danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin of Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or tracking device.
"Or he doesn't notice until after some time what gives the police a time lead," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used as in vehicle positioning.
So the combination of locating function using the GPS system (just like in the car with the Navi) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many spark cords that you could wrap all of the Czech Republic but keep you only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords, to be ignited with explosives.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the stock corporation STV Group, a.s. for a limp 40 million crowns.
In his explanation for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the general staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would use the 60 kilometers of ignition cord every year.
According to the research carried out by army pyrotechnicians, who spoke to MF DNES about this, this statement shows that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the Army Command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and General Vlastimil Picek.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of ignition cords.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that two metres of ignition line is sufficient to train each new professional soldier, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned, even from the point of view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
The soldiers of the Rapid Operations Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense, Vondra, that they had almost no bullets for handguns anymore, so shooting exercises are severely restricted due to the lack of means.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't understand why they buy so many spark cords from us."
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we want to meet as a trader," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition line by saying that the army would have covered up with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnics only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
At the end of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesperson Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: The annual consumption of fuse strings by police pyrotechnics that liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army has already exceeded almost 1,500 metres for a few years.
And the police always order only those quantities of these ammo that they can use before the end of their life.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also reliable ignition cords is also kept open.
In any case, the Ministry of Defense has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who approached MF DNES, in a few years' time the Czech armed forces are expecting the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which they have bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day I have found the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning placement in the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec won the last year of the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition.
The story of his success seems like a movie scene.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that Liberec lacked good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he got a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all types of accommodation in Liberec in just seven years of business activity.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel."
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun-Hotels franchise have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one of last year.
"Huge share of this license sale to run hotels just had the victory in the "Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition, Mr Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory has brought him greater awareness, even popularity, in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well," he remembers.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, any visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened at all.
"I still have regular business relationships with some people I met thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also reflected a little on each of his collaborators.
And that's where he went to the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I really do not regard this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has only moved a little into the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet, accepted the award for the first place of the Vodafone company of the year last year.
At that time, the jury praised the efforts made by him to stamp out small toolmaking in Česká Skalice, a company that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop for rent as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he was employed stop and with a few comrades of his father founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it is only through the success of the mentioned competition and its mediaization that it has entered into the consciousness of the non-professional public.
"Not only did our customers perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to value the fact that they could work with a company that achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year at Farmet, however, was not just about winning euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool manufacturing products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less the citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we couldn't escape this situation either."
"Sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black, even if with lower profits, than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to make compromises - in terms of investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel Žďárský says.
An opinion poll that cleans up nonsense
The "Absurdity of the Year" survey is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
As the dubious winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" survey, the obligation to create documents on online authorities has grown.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand vociferous entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the Commercial Register for checks on social security payers," said the spokesperson of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and regulations, to have the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic fulfilled and to lift the senseless ones.
This year, for the fourth time, this is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Czech business newspaper (HN) and enjoying growing popularity among the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder business activity.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we rank first in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, with an 8th place down on the previous year's ranking.
The contest absurdity of the year was proclaimed for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September.
For registration the web address www.firmaroku.cz. After that the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, or 105 senseless regulations and orders have already been notified for this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways must pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November in Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a happening in which personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, participated in the competition.
"Where the state throws the bosses between its legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to abolish at least thirty clauses each year, which make it unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to get senseless orders out of the world have an effect.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report to the Trade Office at their permanent premises three days in advance the intention to go to an exhibition or fair with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was abolished by virtue of a amendment to the Trade Act.
The duty, which in 2007 received the second largest number of votes - the duty to report to the employment office on missions of employees up to 30 days in size - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card."
And -- all good things are three:
On the absurdity of 2009 the decree was chosen, which required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a fridge and two personal scales in the speech room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator duty fell.
A new category pays tribute to socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsibility-conscious Company of the Year 2010."
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertakings.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, who is the initiator and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
This year's first year of this special sub-category of the main Vodafon company of the year saw companies register for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each one of them is extremely inspiring and would provide enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically with regard to the subject matter of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about people with disabilities, as well as personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes care of its health-damaged employees, which account for 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsibility-conscious Company of the Mittelböhmen Region." In the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it took third place in this region.
In the region of Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a flowing working time reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová, Managing Director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, on the other hand, is concerned with the health of its employees and therefore has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, it also promotes homework for its employees and uses cartering services offered by a home-protected workshop in company actions.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in need," which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with food, work, skills and holidays," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category responsible company of the year all district finalists of the competition Vodafon company of the year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the registration and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete replies in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsibility-conscious Company of the Year," but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration for this competition is not possible because it is only a sub-category of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have taken arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
The latter had allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition were given to a concrete interested party.
Luboš G. is said to have paid half a million for this.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo," who cannot provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police again.
The way in which he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated about given the limited amount of official information.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá referred to Právo's question that the police had actually taken arrests at the Pilsner subsidiary of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she specified.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct designation "call for tenders for land transfer rights under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"Those persons shall offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the property as part of the request."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers will be determined and the land fund will then transfer the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokesperson of the fund.
Luboš G. obviously provided information about who had signed up at the request and since he himself was a legitimate person since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered to a real estate interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat settlement.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitutions for which location decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. from the Land Fund, for example, also purchased land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, on the site where the construction of the access Magistrale to the Borské pole industrial estate was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the Magistrate for a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to add a heavy heart to the building project, in order not to endanger it by blocking the land.
Household housing costs rise by several hundred monthly
As of January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges and district heating and in some places rents will also grow.
From January onwards, families will have to draw several hundred crowns per month more from the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas will be 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to one tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The price of electricity alone costs the housing budgets a few hundred crowns more each year.
Strong electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, which means that it is to blame for the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially photovoltaic installations.
Gas is only moderately expensive, but this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred more crowns per year are to be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Larger places in particular are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kroner per month for district heating from January onwards, and more than 1000 kroner more per year will pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, face 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges, and this in case the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague, however, remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation falls away from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants to prosecute it.
The regulated rents, which are still being paid in nearly 300,000 apartments, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whisky, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen need to be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This can be seen from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief physician of the children's department at the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in taking a bottle from the house bar from the father, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that he can be mixed with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"The most common thing is Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, who was taken from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admission.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Pediatric Department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first brought in with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in her blood and in combination with "extase," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief physician wonders.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in kicking off their offspring is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children are not concerned about real dependence in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholicism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol, including all the related phenomenon, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinová, the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, about forty drunken children were admitted to the local department of paediatric and adolescent medicine until mid-November.
However, only the cases of serious alcohol poisoning that required hospitalisation are included in the statistics.
Drunken children brought home by parents or, if necessary, by the police after outpatient treatment will not be registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of liquor in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes that are 100% reliant on: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of sorrow for the bad witness or because of the joy of the holidays."
"On the Walpurgis Night, I have seen seven drunken children at once in the recording," Dr Pelikán emphasizes.
Paradoxically, a drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who is struggling with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches of the morning after that, caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood, without anything hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes spoiling the patient's mood, at least by telling them the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousand crowns.
"I used this as an educational tool every now and then, when I calculated directly to the children at the visite what cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work over the whole vacation to earn the money for a single party," added Dr Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to regress procedures in order to demand the costs necessary for the healing of the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type have been in possession of a foreign army.
So far, they have only been shown in maneuvers or flight shows abroad.
It is about the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are still stored in the Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
Jan Pejšek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known when she physically expedits the aircraft from Vodochody.
The L-159 single-seater fighter aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from long-term aircraft without further deposits and investments by the department of the ministry.
"The two-seat L-159T1 were replaced in current condition and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to get along without two-seater fighter planes, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four redundant L-159 to the two-seater version.
A new plane took over the army in July, and the second plane wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to enforce the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the buyer to determine how he will realise the matter," Pejšek stated.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence had not advertised a tender procedure for purchasing, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Department argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero, of which they only used 24, and the rest they wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a judicial after-play.
In fact, the European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, Ms. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was applied as for 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
In men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and in men up to sixty, by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which already form at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones the child was exposed to in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that he was aware of this study in a fleeting way, but he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "fully proven."
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly frozen snow, the winter servants were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague "stands."
This said Novinky.CZ of the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometers 91 a truck crashed, at kilometers 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the moat.
There are also problems at km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
The riders should leave just behind Brno at kilometers 190 or drive over Brno and drive up at kilometers 182 at the village of Kývalka.
There are miles of traffic jams.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that immediately at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are formed, for example, in the Prosek district, and Štěrboholská road is also completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis unit meets.
There are also problems with the railroad and airfield.
The Czech State Railway had to negate seven express train connections due to snow drifts.
For example, there are problems on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
It is important that travellers learn about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 a.m. until 5:00 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three side roads are completely impervious, in the surroundings of Brno there are snow drifts and in the surroundings of Blansko there are forced to use snow cutters on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Three streets are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snow cutters will have to be used to clear snow.
When they become navigable again, can not be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
ČTK pointed out that on the roads, which are only allowed to be scattered with inert abrasives for reasons of nature protection, there is a snow cover up to five centimetres thick.
In the Czech Republic, fresh snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon."
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which is only known under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a meeting safety of just a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre bullets, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when impacting the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
This means that they can be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
He is usually not protected from the top, so the murderous steel splinter from above can easily put him out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically goes like this: he sights the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains a precise sighting point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to print it off.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon charges itself and shoots the bullet at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the district of Niederrad in Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be a further 100 jobs in the group, which were previously distributed across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in Astro Park would be better suited to the employees' working methods.
Fujitsu was also only a tenant in Bad Homburg.
CEO Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment among the losers yesterday.
Frankfurt-based business chief Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was another "global player" won.
This is a "great declaration of location."
Fujitsu fits in with the city that the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
Friendly contacts, however, could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
Fujitsu's previously used house on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town ten years ago, along with the remaining buildings at Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously used as parking space and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens, moved into the company.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Opportunities Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu concerto is known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad is to move from Bad Homburg, and the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped layout - the Central Association of Electrical and Electronic Industries has its headquarters, among other things.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The internet service provider Amazon has banned the unveiling platform from its servers.
Possibly behind this is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic deserts.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be in England.
Wikileak's unveiling platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's search lists, is said to be in the UK according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced from Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free," the revelation activists announced via Twitter News Service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic papers in order to cope with the high number of accesses to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks went on to say: "Excellent - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon had stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had done research, reported CNN, citing the office of Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian."
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and ruthless action is putting our national security at risk and endangering life around the globe," said a message from the non-party senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian resides in the UK that Scotland Yard is known for the exact location.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is right about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an advisor to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said on TV that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange there was a blow exchange.
American President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're dealing with the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The American government is now putting the protection of its databases under full review.
The White House announced that the Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, had been appointed as Special Representative.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary after Wikileaks' disclosure of the message reports.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the security of dissidents and the most active should the Wikileaks release put them at risk.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them if this is necessary."
The Ice University
Ice confectioners are prepared for better seasons at the Gelato University near Bologna.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest intake and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the Gelataio and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German somewhat ancient the ice confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator with a spatula, strokes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't get past the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest intake and visitors from all over the world.
There are also several days of special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlour.
Some people dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to bag something of her own after years in a nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelating Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano doesn't forget the icing of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano tips the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools it down to four degrees.
Then he turns a tap on the machine and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice cream varieties.
The lecturer is immediately stormed with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without stabilizers?
How can you let your own desire for experimentation run wild?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course you can make ice even without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will fall into itself, and the customer bites on no ice cream.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on you dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit orbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavors, more fruit puree - this is not necessarily better taste.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice makes the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture correctly enhances the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano draws out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (Winzer thus measure the Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computing.
Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical use as it used to be.
Not only does the device help for the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns are not possible.
The Brazilian Gustavo clings to himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized rod mixer gets out of his control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in twilight
The European Food Authority, Efsa, was infiltrated by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said test biotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi Lobbyist Association for years.
It's paid by corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper had worked decisively on the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and was thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa regulations were identical in terms of sales to the position papers of the Ilsi, thus deceiving the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has put pressure on a collision of interests.
Thus, a high-ranking Efsa manager was recently without restrictions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and had thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) has also recently revealed personnel links between the EU's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which has made both the Federal Environment Agency and the EU Parliamentary public.
However, Efsa cannot identify any conflict of interest.
A statement states that all reputable data can be traced back, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality.
The experts who work for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work at the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this respect, independent experts such as Than criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised in animals without any feeding test and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what genetically modified maize is doing in the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" asks Then indicting.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck thinks.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
In this area, as in the USA, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies would usually not be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had moved in and started to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When construction stopped, most of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't disappear."
He raves: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he sawed one, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the chunks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden bust that once was a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened when the newspapers said in September that he had bought the remnants of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 fans for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it were to happen, it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be reused.
About 200 S-21 opponents took one of the eighty-kilo squares on average, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 big truckloads.
About half of them are still stored in the forest, the rest is sold long ago.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
From everywhere they came and dragged away what could carry trunks and trailers.
The Stuttgart Stones of Impulse have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or into limits of herbal beds.
"Actually this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He climbs into his SUV, makes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and quit, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tons of stones.
He collects his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the largest stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow lie artfully hewn sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, it raves.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
Let's go.
Beautiful travertine.
Once the blocks belonged to the grandstand of Stuttgart's Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be cut by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if you shred like that."
He has not become rich, certainly not rich in stone.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, as well as stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the restorer.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talents fight for high potentials
There is a lively crowd at the buffet.
Sixteen students are pushing for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are to learn about the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists of the achievements of their students, one tries to spot the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company advertises the talents.
A young lady from the Human Resources Department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programmes and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig is responsible for the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with industry and gather experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and figure out who would be eligible as employees."
Such cooperations, Selle said, are not unusual.
It is new that so offensively the students are being huddled.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they must be praising themselves, especially for highly skilled workers.
Graduates from engineering disciplines in particular are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering posts remained vacant in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes to Talentjagd for the auditing and consulting company KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt where participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight promising students across the USA next year.
By the way, participants can take a look at KPMG stores and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger when hewn and stabbed around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For Talentjäger Dykta, the bill seems to be settled.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar action in the past year."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct jumping on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular also go to the Pirsch at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"At Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young people.
Currently 35 jobs are advertised on the company website.
"It's very difficult to occupy vacant positions right now."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give clues that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not announced at the solar specialist.
The company tries to promote this with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation often cannot offer this," says HR Manager Stübe.
Money doesn't play the leading role in the job search anymore.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute prepares an annual top list of German employers.
To this end, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and look at the framework conditions for the employees.
Head of Staff Stübe hopes that the placement will also add value to job seekers.
"I think applicants are looking especially for external evaluations of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer branding is called, i.e., employer branding within the own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify with the company, they would advertise their employer by themselves with friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with gang," Kriegler says.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued a ban on this - and thus definitively revokes its previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April is the trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years.
Before the calamity that killed eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signalled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies.
Those who bear responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been finally resolved.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on Obama's behalf is expected to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been discredited following numerous allegations of corruption, is undergoing fundamental reform.
At the same time, Obama has announced that it will close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the volume of production in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before by means of stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by BDO consultant - even before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also deplores the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new support projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't throw yourself away," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to photograph a boy waving up to the chest in the water with the surrounding streaks: In the rainbow-colored water-gloss, the scene looks almost beautiful.
The fact that brown crude oil swaths float beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the inert flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge quantities of crude oil poured into the huge wetland from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers, the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motor boat stirs up brown broth, who dips his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise out of the ground like black licorice sticks, sad palm trees, which occasionally find themselves hanging their weeds.
Bird swarms, as they are usual in wetlands, are in vain: As soon as the outboarder is silent, the former paradise smelling like a gas station spreads spooky calm.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe entered, here in the 1980s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, the first resistance was organized, here the Shell Group had to stop producing in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
The Company is still unable to return to Ogoniland today: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of Switzerland with over 5000 drill sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the Group's situation is too unstable.
Every few hundred metres, steel frames like bizarre sculptures stand out from the water: "Christ trees" are called the heads of drill holes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most up to the mark corroded.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have flown into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" had invaded the sea 21 years ago in front of Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU are being argued about it.
While the Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: The rate of faults on the pipes alone is "many times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that from afar looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky, the mangroves appear: they are shattered and oil-lubricated up to the neck.
A fire flickers under one of the many barrels, some of which are connected to tubes, some of which are scattered arbitrarily on the site: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, head of the group.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the pick-up pot, later drips out at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still beat the ridiculously low price of diesel with almost 40 euro cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost daily in the entire Niger delta.
However, only a tiny part of the temporary intermediate raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share is filled by organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tanker ships and are blurring it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate, whether the environmental catastrophe is due to the people's efforts or the lax mode of production, to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell was destroyed to such an extent that only a withdrawal of the Group could be possible: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese might turn out to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's high time you guys left," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the armed forces' special forces are caught by the illegal oil refiners, they are not threatened with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, who come mainly from the country's north, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This fucking stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error during the investigation of an emergency landing machine, which could lead to a "catastrophal engine failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November were apparently much more fortunate than they have known so far: the Australian aviation security authority has detected a major security problem in its investigations with the engines of some A380 machines - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, according to an opinion of the ATSB authority published this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure."
Rolls-Royce engines produced in 20 A380 aircraft are affected.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, which allowed him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would claim compensation for the incident in early November.
When the engine was fired, parts had been loosened and the wings had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the Superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily let down about three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa changed the engine for an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Countrywide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Snow has fallen overnight almost all over the country.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights are falling out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: At freezing temperatures, almost the whole republic snowed on Thursday at night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east there are some 15 centimetres thick snow blankets.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, fierce gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 metres above the normal level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snow drifts on motorways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the Severe Weather Centre Meteomedia, alarm level was therefore violet in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
Some 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused for damage.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major incidents on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stagnating traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, considerable disruptions occur in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firemen and rescue workers with blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman of the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although few stranded passengers are at the airport, they still have nearly 400 camp beds.
Accidents occurred on many streets on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The locomotive driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was captured on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the line from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed the street with her car near Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: The snow will still be loose and powdery and will therefore stir up even with light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: according to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters nice: The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs for the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell properties ourselves and then rent them back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution is thus returning its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and then extensively renovated it.
According to the data, the energy conversion swallowed up around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead buddies
More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a violent explosion had occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the unhappiness shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue personnel could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies anymore.
The bodies haven't been recovered yet.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Ten thousand people had gathered in the bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They kept silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners there were 29 tables, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies could be seen.
Images and personal items, including garments and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags blew on half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemorative ceremony.
"But they never came home."
He could not end his son's death unless he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative ceremony.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit into the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries with his warrior epic "Walhalla Rising."
Which audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he filmed "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and turns his opponents in rows with almost superhuman forces - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabiatic killing methods and already rips his enemies' intestines out of the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, one-eye, as it is actually called, doesn't say a word about the whole film, and even the other characters can be carried to one or two sentences or a few agonizing death cries at most.
Otherwise, silence and bevelling in the creepy hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the Viking world the backdrop of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for adult cinemats with interest for existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Nice, if a movie has several target groups, only pity if they exclude each other.
Since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the Arthouse with a little more humor.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, uni-eye breaks up with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and hides an eternity in fluff and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-draining façade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
This film isn't about dialogues or a stringent plot, it's all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack he slowly tightens his throat, but above all with the incredible hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who is loyal to the eye preserves himself like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, may be the Devil's ambassador himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only for those who are already corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film, which you can hate and admire, to anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country is resisting to comment on this - it still allows for controls.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the block with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that departs from the current.
According to a briefing from the US foreign intelligence agency CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, the technique from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, she revealed where which components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was close to commissioning, it was said, but not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little more is known than then, yes, the riddles became bigger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of an "alleged reactor," even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how certain he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat replied in summer only in a lapidary manner that the IAEA had "sufficient material to ask questions."
While the Syrians quickly set aside the debris of the alleged "unused military building," they thoroughly planned the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
Moreover, via a Member State, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always declared that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also prevents inspectors from carrying out a second inspection in el-Kibar and from accessing the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel, too, is still iron.
"We'll never comment on this," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
The investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 without results and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the area over which the IAEA guards.
The IAEA seems to see three other facilities to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor as the key to progress in reconnaissance - and, unlike this, they still exist.
Until now, inspectors have not disclosed which installations are involved, which functions they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and, on satellite images, identified a building complex at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely on this basis, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the USA to spy on military facilities.
The nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three places and the block on the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be separated from it later, there are plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could contain valuable traces, was stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information on where the debris has remained.
The Salzmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a repository for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently associated her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
Photographs from orbit show, however, that Syria did earthwork in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
Moreover, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to safeguard any military secrets - only the effort shows the great interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also ironed this proposal.
If Western diplomats had appeased in Vienna a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, the matter therefore had no high priority, for example US ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting into play so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, a majority is needed in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are far from being forced to escalate.
On the other hand, as a diplomat points out, "What if they find nothing at all?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor remains persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, and some shooting days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary on short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee aid agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself ambassador of the UN refugee relief agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
According to Hasecic, the meeting had to take place in Bosnia.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims betrayed her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, their organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, who got to read her script, after a few moments, granted a filming permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard in the Yugoslavia conflict to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the web, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other in it before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different from the variant "Sacrifice of rape inmates in torture" after all.
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
According to Jolie, the pressure on her is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now it seems that only the hackers of Hollywood can bring peace to her: By making the screenplay illegal, as so many have done before.
Let's get out of here.
This evening it finally runs really round again for the Irish.
No sign of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans are joking with joy with loud music, they are pounding with their feet.
The Bailey Pub in Cork in southern Ireland trembles because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro winning bonus plus air tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself in distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will have interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a poor feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still have no work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a jerk, she had a wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, predicting experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, a wave of emigration is comparable to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly disturbing for the young, well-trained Irish, for whom it has only been uphill so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from young expatriates who complain: "Everything goes down in Ireland. "
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one will turn off the light, please."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future coming up because the government is merely eyewashing and offers young people no more prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her fellow students hang out from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to take on the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a trade fair that offers an all-round service on working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known for six months what it feels like to build somewhere else.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
They're pulling up a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January we continue to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home in the meantime, because he makes extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he first steps over the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways large, expensive cars park.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent financed by credit.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer doesn't like the wailing he hears often at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as it used to be here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe it will make us feel Irish first."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that thought.
Let the future open and just see how it goes with life somewhere else.
A few years of work in London he's already been through, and why shouldn't things go well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one thing that worries him very much these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might turn into a goodbye party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says and drinks a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walk-out party, easy, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democarian Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing by about 6% a year since 2002, the number of supporters of democracy has risen from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp fall last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This continued during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violence has increased.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey do many people in Latin America see crime in their country as a major problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% say that either she or a family member were victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the figures have dropped and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The rise in economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the private and market economies: around 71% of respondents across the region indicated that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% stated that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
Brazil, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, on the other hand, see the US as the most influential country, with Venezuela playing this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An election flap
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts far surpassed the fears of the electoral helpers who rushed to help the puffed-up country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballots in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Choices opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless due to the January earthquake, roamed around in search of an option.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the abolition of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as "very good in many matters."
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first-lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who receives little or no support from the voters, declares that he is the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims are still living in tents, low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by lack of organisation.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest figure since her election in 2007.
Whether this will help you to re-elect next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president to spend the extra revenue at his own discretion.
On paper, last year the Fernández government lost its majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further divisions.
Some regime critics from the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarians hit another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," the President said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money as he wishes.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be its main objectives, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Census INDEC, which then presented the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to hold talks.
According to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, it is possible that Cristina Fernández would like to reconnect Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the preparation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step towards the clean-up of INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without her husband's support after her term of office has ended.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentineans return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been brought to her will be ebbed.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to lift many of her husband's political decisions quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching closer ties with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters, rose to elect mayors and city councils in the five districts, which is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed relations with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only close.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it received no majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swinging mass parades and sparsely clothed dancers, occurred.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempt at murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
Bizarre proof is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which gave the KMT more voices.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to place its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time the DPP avoided too much to stir up the anti-Chinese feelings.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese people support his China policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy of bringing Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of professionals and youth.
As the DPP's presidential candidate, Tsai received great support, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she, too, is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a forging of ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires discussion without prejudice.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's premature rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is hard to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favour of a re-approach only to a limited extent.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no turning back."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the Year
If you act at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony at the Nobel Prize Ceremony in 2009. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released no more than three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And with her lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can easily compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success comes closest in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nomination Spalding.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favourite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robotic favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme," has been awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where otherwise more albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well deserved attention in the category of large group. He thus competes against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles." This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The L.A. based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" performed by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati"; and Verdi's "Requiem" performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu vom Orchester des Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded in Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen on January 4.
The approximately 30-minute piece has the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the Orchestra Performance category for a recording of Stravinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Zeixx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Classic Crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five-hour, often heated public hearing, the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows justice."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to the press enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," was a comment.
"It's another monkey planet, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is finished."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence in the Temecula Valley.
His community with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 large Mediterranean-style mosque should have two minarets and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 property on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their opinion a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It requires either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will be published on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California's Mono Lake is growing even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said Arizona State University co-author Ariel D. Anbar.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can set in motion biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that one element can be replaced by another in basic biochemical processes and structures," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes exposed to both could possibly replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it almost smears everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life-form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has not been a working example.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early Earth age," Forster said, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibits found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibits stolen from a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday night, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are good," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide exact information about the location of the dogs, nor about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say any more," Whitmore explains.
"We're tracking some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a downey district bull's home.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were unharmed according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition this week, were missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was due to participate in the competition.
Peek told the Times on Wednesday that the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's almost one month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's reward to anyone who could give a clue to the corgis. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage would be paid.
The lion roars again after the court's approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "prepared" Glaeuberplan to repay the debt of $5 billion and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of US law, so that nothing stands in the way of the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will be in charge of the slightly slimmed-down studio as chief executive.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually does not enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself raises $75 million, is running the company. The financing is expected to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year to solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial worries and pay off more than 140 of the studio's creditors lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all started from the beginning when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is worth $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for managing the company, receives a $4 million "success bonus."
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and prepared an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released at the beginning of 2012.
They are also planning two films after "Der kleine Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result in any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gambles can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of play doh.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently, looking for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost slightly less than last year.
And although less new toys appear with their own website, there is a broader offer on the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button cells-powered toys are on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not stated otherwise, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when you press on their belly.
Press once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you've started pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to the innovative hinge feet with wheel blocking it dominates the Moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better knowledgeer with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as the one on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which, according to Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series, is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8).The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head cell powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he can take a lot of time.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived for some time in our dog's mouth.
Police operations in China are becoming softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's rugged guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their tendency to violence - to impress the spectators.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, barely outgrown to the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped bows.
"They look average to me," Mr. Tang notes with contempt.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray green one.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low staring: In 2009, according to reports, 50 officials orbited an improperly positioned food truck and stared at the operator until he packed in and left the site after half an hour.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the urban police patrols. They have been specially selected for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are to give the coarser police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, however, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad picture that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officers in Hubei Province beat a viewer to death when he filmed her with his cell phone as they beat down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a Beijing officials' training manual was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street traders.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year after further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleanup. "
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the Distrik was looking for eight female recruits by advertisement in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advert, women between the ages of 18 and 22 were looked for with a good figure and "harmonious features."
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physically exhausting.
"The most important thing is their image," stated an unnamed district official at the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district administration, does not agree with this description,
But admitted that in China, size specifications in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this should be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical deformities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lame or hunchbacks here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple rolls and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn't feel sexist that so much emphasis is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply shooing traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the patrol deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before being chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have already told you this so many times!" explains Ms. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and who had temporarily abandoned his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"Everything routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the merchants, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is supposed to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, Yunnan Province's capital, rioted after the rumor that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured during the night incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, contrary to the regulations.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol, remained behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're going verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time people start the fight."
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges that were brought against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the heaviest legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "excited" about the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first published in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped to create lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasurer during Ensign's election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the records and interrogations, he took over for them after hiring Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was in Ensign's election team recently, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethic experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on revolving door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be an agreement and a violation of the revolving door statues," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defense of clients targeted by the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the ministry seemed very cautious in taking political charges after a large number of defeats that were persecuted by the media with great interest, including last year's decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for wrongdoing on the part of the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrifying," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington (an organisation aimed at combating corruption in the US parliament and government), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to justice.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday, and another one the next day, when he was told that the ministry would not bring any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: we believe we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail dated December 2008 proves that, after Mr. Hampton continued as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "attacking" the Ministry of the Interior over a matter.
Mr. Ensign had also arranged for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after the latter had stopped Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair came to the public for the first time, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth among the Republicans.
After he hadn't noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigation, his press spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hoped that the ethics commission would very quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and stop his investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calling draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped off in the riots in the courtroom.
At a minute's notice, they sent their reports on horrible witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will come to an official end when the verdict on the death sentence issued by the jury falls.
However, Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications with the court to explain the reasons for an appeal and to deal with the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that intensive reporting on the process - including through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has resulted in a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread, immediate penetration of stirring details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public indignation.
This objection could prompt the appellation courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this trial, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' main defender.
Last week, the presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, dismissed the requests by decision briefly and bluntly when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who allegedly killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some people believe that the television series and the feature film "Auf der Flucht" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court appeals that Mr. Haye's conviction looks at half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes that are being persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts might be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is only one of many that the lawyers of Mr. Hayes present to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been prejudiced when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them ghastly crime scene photos during the juror selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their sobriety, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, have filled them with abhorrence.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had unduly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors weren't isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a lawsuit they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
"Such a daily rush of media peppers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more intrusive than reports that are more slowly reimbursed is an anti-tech look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellation courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted on the basis of the report, and made it clear that the New Media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign of swearing words and negativity, little courtesy broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government period in which decisions were no longer taken.
After all that one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an observance of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party gathering points.
The public meeting of the President's deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that continue to exist between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which they are demanding one of the other signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the electorate's patience for a new party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, the November elections in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken party passions that die again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, be it temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise can be expected regarding the increased unemployment benefits, albeit only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, the optimism has increased that we can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insituation warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-tuning is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see many things happening from now on until 2012, as preliminaries, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
However concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are pokering too high, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and suspend health reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the German Commission on the deficit, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, raising retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have urged so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting very hard to get even closer to that figure.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and health system, then later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Today, partiality and polarization are greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a wider ideological divide between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere foreplay for a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
Sucked-through US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "cleptocracy" and it passes on to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service extort high protection money so that they can keep their expensive living standards in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "verticals of authority" - takes its share of the money that the leaders move up.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime has been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption allegations for years, and he has won numerous slander lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked for a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the government of Moscow and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the biggest companies and that the police arrests small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as before."
The memo notes that while collecting funds is extensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but has also noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, Director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, it estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that one can solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that this is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concreted classroom with dirty and scorching walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook that for the first time told children of former soldiers the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodian community tribunal sentenced for the first time a former Khmer Rouge member when it sentenced former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments the fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, complicated their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodia's society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that is researching the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It splits families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government fell in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh Prison, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the gruelling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few Khmer Rouge elite officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The task of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge reign in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she was in charge of the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were likely to die.
On a hot evening, In Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court should summon her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court accused more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything."
The center created the first schoolbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are sentenced by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Above in the Dangrek mountains, a road covered with shrubs and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile phone saleswoman on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will take off a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that he would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to continue to accumulate weapons-enabled uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's global nuclear security campaign, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to collect uranium that was no longer highly enriched and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been reached with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about £500.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the nuclear security summit (of 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-compatible, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna make it dirty bombs and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus nevertheless approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, say officials.
It was loaded into a special train that more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by plane.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for this effort, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with low enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Distributable Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-powered uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections of the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not object to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as a telegram from the U.S.A. Ambassador in Madrid indicates.
This reflects the documents enveloped by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily "El País" (via cable). It is added that the former deputy head of government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid for inhumane practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was charged, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "has taken Zapatero away" and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objection to intelligence flights across Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed" to avoid being "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little scope for influence, as they are in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of documents from the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to act discreetly between governments," Aguirre laments.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the US Ambassador and Spanish Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are incredibly concerned about their independence and do what they think is appropriate," he gave instructions to his staff to avoid "blowing up rhetorical comments to let the tension flow."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government of Zapatero's actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, has tolerated or deliberately ignored, will capitalize, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he emphasizes.
The child killer confesses that she has complained on the Internet about the "toil" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the internet "Muki."
Under this nickname, which she leads from a small age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one girlfriend. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
In order to understand these, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She held a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his alumni never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke up and they split up.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him this, he liked it, but now he realizes, of course, what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and to be able to leave what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to send you the boy."
She complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that if everything goes well, she will take her firstborn.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. I will never leave him with anyone but my mother again in life," a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and allegedly was murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On one hand César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"He's with me on one side and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"Great kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he finds me, such a crap."
On the 30th one more thing: "The boy is fine. He goes into a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and manga logs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison-deprived woman."
"Terror a la gallega (Headnote) '.
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunter, declares to have remorse for feeling guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to the Palma Provincial Detention Centre in Menorca yesterday.
The defense lawyer, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and to store his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in the number of votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - in advance or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as that of the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while the number in the 2006 regional elections was only 316,222.
On the last Sunday the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's votes and the binding of the PP's electorate - persists, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congressmen in the parliamentary elections, while CiU would also win four (now she has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (from 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could hold or win its MP.
However, if the election calendar is to be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue in the balance to put an end to socialist supremacy, namely in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists cannot achieve a majority or resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party will lose its representation in Barcelona's municipal council, in which it would have to achieve 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona's transformation, where they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
In Lérida the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party also recorded a significant increase.
Currently the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian policemen arrested by the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Liberation Movement of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the Bombay attacks, which claimed 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which go so far as to assure that the "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaeda's counterfeit apparatus worldwide and "with its ability to act."
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups of which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda was composed, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without impunity.
The exposed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network active in Europe, which is why other European police forces, besides the Thai investigative bodies, have contributed to the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that in the EU's territory in the next few days there will be similar attacks to those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agnbiade were arrested), another operation was carried out in Thailand in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanalaya Kijbummung were arrested.
They had managed the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passports in accordance with the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
It is emphasized in the investigation circles that until now no connections between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination attempt in Bombay could be detected, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba," was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command," which put an end to the life of 106 people.
The police confiscated an extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to postpone the tax agreement
Yesterday, the chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas with his terms of reference in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already set during the election campaign and can be summed up by the primacy of economic recovery and the failure of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party was certainly addressing Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU depends on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting when he took office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into at the next parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As far as the party presidents of the PPC are concerned, the party demands that in support of the taking up of office "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum are left behind.
Both political leaders have a common desire to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and to abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with the details of the negotiations for the inauguration of Mas.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out the fact that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people.
Yesterday, those responsible for the care of the elderly at La Caritat in Olot, Gerona, gave a press conference in which they pointed out the damage caused to the institution by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the caretaker who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during his work.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat would like to sue the person responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a loss of social standing because it did not establish the criminal acts of the caretaker in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home for the elderly - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities due to their age and illnesses were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point completely and stated that "no action could have been the reason for the incident at all times."
La Caritat's attorney added that "there is no evidence in the lawsuit of negligent acts by a person other than the accused."
Baptized as a "death angel," he confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that he had committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and that he had murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that access by personnel to the drugs is difficult to control.
The nurse used insulin syringes and sedative cocktails in six out of nine crimes to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the lab tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually choosing a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it from within by giving them bleach, as he confessed to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the nurse's statements, not even in the number of known murders that could be anymore. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his course of action after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threat signs of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors responded strongly yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk premiums of the Euro-Peripheri countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has barely increased in points, which causes concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses, but due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited quarterly access to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue to buy bonds and to send out a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets will be thrown back and if stubbornly insists that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, at which the Bank reaffirmed that it would not consider buying sovereign debt and that markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of markets as Trichet said.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated to be about 10,000 million in the short term and possibly another 15,000, and there is time until February to raise private capital or nationalize these banks.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it did not recognise the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will have to obtain parliamentary support for its new budget, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of the heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish President yesterday presented the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions as well as in financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we are relying on strong demand that will remove all doubts about our debt restructuring capacity.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only being counts, but also appearance."
Courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of owls contests the Shareholders' Meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the societies owls and El Enebro, does not vanish.
David Álvarez, founder of the Corporate Gurppe, will challenge the El Enebro Shareholders' Meeting, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, since he considers them "absolutely void." His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the corporate group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not appear to be willing to give in to his dispute over the control of the institutions of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children who appointed themselves members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting of 18 January this year, which is already registered in the Commercial Register as challenged.
The General Meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, triggered a new thunderbolt in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
The court's appeal for the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as "a desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the nullified meeting of 18 January, through legal instincts, fraudulent activities and abuse of rights," as official spokespersons explain.
This argument is the basis for the discussion of the Assembly in retrospect in order to declare it "absolutely void. "
In June, the same protagonists, who shrouded in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - the asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family records, the founder of the Service Group demands the right to use more than 51% of capital.
This is the actual background to the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to deal with the action for challenge for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, her story has been shaped by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
In the beginning nobody paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, everyone put on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari in the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to reduce the capabilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in its hands and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This software, called PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that using this software in the Red Bull Formula 1 factory "in a few hours, almost in real time," can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 there were an average of ten technicians working in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull's team. They perform analyses and all sorts of changes to the racing car with powerful computer systems.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula One team is allowed to spend on its races in one season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula One hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the services of its participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is zero.
The Technologichef of the plant, Steve Nevey, emphasized that five years ago, the R&D progress for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the percentages have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while pilots' contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by IT, because they are "not predictable gladiators."
HP will open twenty stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of a network of 20 shops, each with 80 to 100 square metres, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The Company agrees on this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted shop on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of them in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming new openings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice-president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the store is always the same. They rely on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network intended to "optimize customer service and advice for small and micro-enterprises in purchasing and after that, even packaging."
The Barcelona store has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as for private customers, because large companies already have their technical customer service contracts," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from his rivals in three years
The Executive Board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a fall in interest rate margins, which banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a still too existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you withdraw the customers who will lose the bank - which is the major challenge facing this bank, as it has so far paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year, it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with an annual report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all bank plans around the world.
Sabadell will conclude its four-year guidance plan, which was initially designed for three years, but was extended by one year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach."
The manager assumes that Spain is only "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - essential for the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which penalises the interest margins - will run away, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their issuances in order to maintain liquidity will already be passed on to the price of loans as compensation for declining profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the tap off, but the interest differential is very high," Guardiola admitted.
On Thursday, Banesto already issued an order to her branch network to limit the granting of long-term loans and increase interest rate differentials (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the policy of " increasing charges " but " within a competitive framework. "
Sabadell's guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures us that "larger companies are necessary" in Spain.
"Everything will change next year," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "increasing enormously" and does not rule out the fact that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red figures.
He felt that the FROB could replace the money market in the case of capital increases.
After asserting that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already prophesying a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but, unlike the June events, short-term funding could be achieved through repo transactions and thus the crisis could be absorbed.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers of savings banks
CECA's Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a wave of savings banks being merged and stressed the speed with which the sector was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not insist on participating in the first phase. They reserved for themselves the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed and the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be regarded as a second round, but rather as adjustments."
"Most of it has been completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all processes."
During a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timing of the business plans with Banco de España, which was established in earlier times, not now," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he emphasized.
Olavarrieta stated that "there were a number of indisputable opinions about the slowness of the process, the indifference and nonsense," because "Banco de España exhorts us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the whole world, adding that those who doubted this would do so "without deeper knowledge."
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we need to "not worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a "very significant" process of concentration that will be carried out "as soon as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to retain the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has put forward new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the EUR 426 support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former President Felipe González, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-establishment of the German mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large proportion of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a redesign of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the cessation of payments of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time now, so there are no excuses.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the drift between what Germany thought necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
At that time this was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, public opinion and public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has once again come out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable a country to be rescued and, at the same time, to oblige private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it drives forward the Irish crisis and everything that follows.
But their proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line which it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area, in which the countries that are opposed to it will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and, in this case, the private sector will have to cover part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to pursue a tough growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as Spain cited in boom times, will simply not be acceptable.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad not to understand.
It's not just about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will make use of the opportunities offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in the home has paved its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Among the possibilities envisaged, the fact that we would have to leave the euro area full of little serious countries is not to be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulation bypass
Tricks like those by Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventive spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed about whether or not it was an unsporty action and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will comply with the prescribed penalty in the next league match against the Auxerre, thus entering the next game phase without playing cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules that have been followed in this sport.
Part of the upcoming debate about the presented case is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who in his anthem pretended elegance and honor and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role, and the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long story as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this practice, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts constitute a rule-breaking. Indeed, this procedure adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the spirit of sport should be investigated.
The sport spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the opposing players taking undue advantage of the counterteam, either.
The paradox of the action of Real Madrid's players is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by misplay or bypassing rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but rather should be as conspicuous as possible in order to punish it by the referee.
The players waited and accepted the penalty joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the objectors draw from the intentional fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival was not put in a less favorable position, nor were benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, which is uncertain up to a certain degree, as the team could eventually withdraw. In addition, players receive a penalty with this approach and pass into the second card cycle, in which they withdraw less because of card accumulation with one card than in the first cycle.
This does not make it so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which includes strategic decisions to maximise the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule bypass), they wanted to choose when they would be subject to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or escaping punishment.
Although the boundary between invention and the rule environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemic has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked transmission of rules.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offering for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year dropped an avalanche of reservations on the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas Slotterie, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season that provide oxygen to Barcelona's catering and leisure industry. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive in order to capture the customer segment, which is the big crowd: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinners on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to miss this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are demanded, confirmed Gaietà Farràs, chairman of the Barcelona Restaurant Committee.
The representative of the umbrella organisation has not yet dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it a dozen times before they make a reservation."
"They would like to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he emphasized.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost after the second quarter's revenues have bloomed again and good prospects for the Christmas business, albeit concentrated on a few days.
Sources from the Group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends groups celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus as a price hit. It seems that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green shoots sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back on the rise.
On the side of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "lively" overall, although the customers "take out a maximum."
However, the fun of celebrating did not go back, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Wikileaks' revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the verge of the clarifying and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear safety is not strengthened, but on the contrary "absorbed" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country."
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored in order to complicate their destruction in a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are identified by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area under Taliban attack, the probable dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is no longer considered by the US, but also by Russia to be excessive and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan must recruit strictly believing personnel to guard nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural level, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people involved in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
What's new on the documentation unveiled by Julian Assange's website is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan is slowing down in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in which Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," declares: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite Pakistan's economic disaster, it produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington to "clarify" that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups" during a visit by the Chief of Army, General Ashfaq Kayani.
Hunting for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking anti-terrorist leader to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning to prosecute and find Assange.
Everything connected with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts can only be difficult to clarify.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" on the "discovery and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse the Australian has to face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
As early as the 20th, the International Police Department, based in Lyon (France), issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities received the authority.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and find Assange "to arrest and deliver him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organisation, many Member States regard the red warning as a free letter of arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is probably present.
The action outraged Assange's lawyers, who gestured to publish a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for leave from Sweden and that the prosecutor, who was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security, received the appropriate authorisation.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia claims her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time per Skype magazine from an indefinite location. During the interview, he requested the resignation of Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking anti-terrorist officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt by the spokesperson of President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators have expressed these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January onward, has called on the Department of State to investigate the possibility of placing Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations "to seize their funds and to prosecute anyone who supports them or contributes."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution is too mild punishment," he told the station Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the Party to vote secretly on its continued office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the tenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the directionless ERC after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the vote.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
Yesterday, for the beginning, it was announced that the more than 200 Regional Council members of ERC could secretly comment on his stay in office.
With ballots, not with a high hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without stating percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Cardinals call on the President more than just the Party to make his office available. An inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the supreme body of congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Executive Board on a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be presented to the Council for a vote by the leadership on 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to pre-position the Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party leader already considers to be a fact.
The chairman of the ERC believes that "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the reigning Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for different goals."
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is to say, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a function.
He thus advocated a reform of the statutes, which would enable the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
From the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, who fought for it already at the last two congresses, is obsessed.
In fact, at the 2008 quaking assembly, Party leadership was commissioned to review the general assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This deadline is still pending, as infogle's internal rest of the last few years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors being lurking, the time may have come to take up this matter again and complete it forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
At COP16, China's representative said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, says Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
During his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
He explained that progress had been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which contained the objectives of reducing the emission of gases.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, state authorities had cooperated with central government and local authorities to achieve energy saving, effective use of energy and emission reduction targets.
He also stated that some multi-annual plans have already been launched or finalised, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those received from other countries.
For example, he referred to the effective use of energy programme, which has been introduced over the past five years and which has received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private sector.
There is also a project at provincial level on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs by energy-saving bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, scientific government advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than was commonly thought.
He pointed out that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amount to six tonnes per person, while in the United States they are 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years and another step is to be taken by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former party leader had the right to appeal to the National Commission for Order and to demand what the right was granted to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was rightful and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to appeal to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right conferred on him.
In an interview held before Gabino Cué Monteagudo's appeal as Governor of the State, he stated that the exclusion of Espino was a decision made at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said, it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance of presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and served its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not frightened by internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman, or the best chairman, Acción Nacional will need for the next three years, and that is why he would "overlay the fat to the one that the Council would designate."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to give each of the five the office of party chairman."
He predicted that the party's recovery in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not the time to think of 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be watched throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in it and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his disc course in his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, should they finally come out of the closet," he affirmed.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the Federal Government could make expressions such as those in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on the mouth and even less censorship.
Obama advocates the law in Twitter for undocumented students
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passing of this law," the president of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law to Legalize Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passing of this law," Obama tweeted.
It contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document, which calls on the public to enter into contact with their senators without delay, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all vote for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from the Bush era and the financing of the government would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could have an impact on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the blockade of the Republicans of the Law Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that he trusted that once the tax issue had been resolved, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year" ...
"I believe that we can make an agreement about this at any time, and then we can plan the process of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act law, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, would be more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Law, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not sixteen years old during the last five years living in that country and enrolled at a higher educational institution or army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them said that the senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust of Language' was a walk in which the participants made a strong contribution to the story.
"I understand the thing about sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the round table was devoted to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentine scripture sweetly spit at the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table hosted by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then characterized the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to know what a "wound" is and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she receives no answer, but hints for the guide to her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the passage, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs with relief and closes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the lust for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called 'Lob of Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magic realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turnaround and told of America, the great novel that had not been lacking in his own chroniclers from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories depicted as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even lost the sense of shame."
However, he emphasizes that "it is the crazy and liar who best imagines things," and that is where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which FIL's invitation to the Round Table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain an implicit, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained after emphasising that literature is communication and commitment that builds between the author and the readers as if it were a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also hevorob raised "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer."
He noted that in a fast-paced world the intellectual habits and control of consciousness also lead to dogmatisms, and will forget "that behind every confirmation is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: and nuance often means putting the finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
The duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game also contrasts with two different styles set by their respective coaches, and their encounter, marked by opposites, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine has played high with the medal to the second champion, he has left one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santistic strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he had a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he achieved the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a setback again, because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went out in a draw after 210 minutes, but at the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to insert his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be followed by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell in order to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when asked about the lost finals.
The last final game remained in his memory, he assured that he learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee doesn't whistle the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players are prepared, too, because the last time we were already prepared to leave with two penalty points, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game isn't finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shooting doesn't worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shooting, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the intense effort to hold the title in our hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope it won't happen this time."
It is in Romanso's power to be no longer just a second champion and to taste for the first time the fame the titles bring with them.
The US amends the rules for obtaining a visa
Before talking to the consulate, people must introduce themselves to the services for visa applications; costs will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the procedures for applying for a visa in the Embassy of the United States and consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before talking to the consulate.
The personnel of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay for the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over separately.
The applicant shall pay only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterweight to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to imagine at the nearest ASC, where they submit their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation at the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for a visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service premium of $26.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA Announces the Find of Alien Life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aerospace Agency (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "an exciting find for the search for extraterrestrial life," which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments thought to be uninhabitable, it could exist human-like creatures. It was suggested that these could turn into intelligent beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it's a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment thought to be too toxic to all imaginable forms of life, as the lake is highly arsenal.
In some way, the microbe uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances are that there might be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually a different life form, a second life form that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its find at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The reform of the organ law on Congress introduced the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and already an opposition bloc, led by the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who introduced himself as an independent, had been installed. The four questioned the following: the entry into the Chamber of the 'two-party system'.
Before the start of the inaugural session in the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corra Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as they were excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau headed by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corra Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political edge with these reforms.
He stated that in the next few days they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, based on their political will and if they did not have it, they would again be subjugated by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Up until here I come (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they don't even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralistic group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that an eternal two-party system should reign in Congress."
"For starters, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues so that they can become more," said the Convergence member.
In allusion to PAN and PRI, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT stated that Congress had at present turned into a 'prey' for two.
"Previously it was only one party, now they split up these two."
Patrón Montalvo applied to respect the Members and to give them their place at the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left out on the basis of top decisions, which are likely to be nine Members, and the five that are currently seen as being split up into different political groups have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because, as a result of the reform that has been carried out and agreed upon by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check for a little over 200,000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city council.
This amounts to 1 200 000 pesos paid to the company's owner in the second half of the year.
According to the website for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque, issued on an amount of 200,144,56 peso, was issued with the number 9258447 last November with the purpose of "accounting for open invoices."
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent ahead that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and consequently the number of checks still to be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just paying the debts, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "revealed" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two from 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last from 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is called into question by ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on July 25 the examination of cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it became known that, from March 2008 until July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of office of the mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had already paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist in the collapse of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourist industry asked the authorities to pay particular attention to areas in poor condition and to cast a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Trade Union of Zona Dorada, recalled that on various occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and walkways had had a negative effect, as tourists would come strolling and see the disorder, and they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work in this way slowly and planlessly."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the city.
"The community must assume its responsibility and avoid this happening again. How should it do this? Well, by means of preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything in retrospect," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, but also because we inhabitants have a right to a clean environment. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly on track," he added.
"These arrangements have not received enough attention, and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist resorts of Mazatlán because they were not used properly and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought up together with the city. To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first need to be cleaned up and cleaned in order to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we promote this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take the great responsibility to set a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a dignified parliament, free of collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and facing big problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 members of PAN, three members of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and another of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneur's Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility to set a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right to act freely on agreements between the parties, because it is common practice for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming them into carnival companies of the ruling and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them during the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary status in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign currency and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourism projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King Is Looking for
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Epiphany day, because the household is composed of no more and no less than twelve persons and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so desire.
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are announced because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarin and potatoes... already in the afternoon I go to the street with the morons for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothes in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would love to have this monster', but I replied, 'Let's wait, boy', because it was very expensive', Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías is the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel is the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, around ten house searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region as part of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be charged with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in places that were supposed to have served mainly for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, of whom two of the men who are considered to be the main string pullers of the drug ring come from Sherbrooke.
The arrested were reported to have appeared in front of the courthouse in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
Among other things, they could be accused of the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation, which took place for more than a year.
"The information received from the public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrian Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could easily be prosecuted
The Conservatives' draft law, which according to the government is intended to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is likely to be trampled on after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I'm holding with a party that has tied you up," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, at the end of the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person identified by a seaship for the transport of illegal immigrants for up to one year, violates the Canadian Constitution on Law and Freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the draft law as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned the critics away from the hand, demanding that their party did not stand firm enough against the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is precisely what we are trying to achieve by means of another draft law, the C-35," Chow said.
We do not support the Conservatives' draft legislation because it seeks the blame of the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least one year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform the MEPs that they do not tolerate this type of secret immigration, these criminal events that affect Canada and treat the country as a kick-off party."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenney's reaction.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a Conservative has said to the QMI agency that the government would call for a vote to ensure that every member of parliament who has been opposed immediately declares himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that, despite the presence of Robert Dutil, this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Québécois Party, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as a "carved rabbit" as well as "rightly crafted solution at a table end."
Minister Dutil, for his part, had turned to those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he contented himself to affirm.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA (state university for the training of high-level administrative officials).
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes that the Quebec grant a special mandate to audit the accounts so that they can investigate corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of examination control," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec could give the same power to the audit authority as Commissioners, which would also allow her to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government drawers.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal law in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed the Attorney General Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police officers, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict guard due to high rainfall since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road sank into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfalls of 40 to 70 milliliters of rain have poured out on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 further millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Here up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had come down.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to this rainfall, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebecer Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood surveillance and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn away due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Security remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to security officer Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State Flood Centre issued warnings about the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians, as well as because of his speech about radio.
The CCNR believes that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their opinions, certain statements "would have contained impeccable information on social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such a crude speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first decision was taken following a complaint lodged by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec."
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators should rather provide solid information rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the likely consequences of the Dupont le midi programme would have raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not blamed at all for his person.
The last issue concerned the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
In this respect, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective argument that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he did not donate in favour of Haiti's aid, since one would not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative presentation of the Haitians.
"I have already lost my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," explained the presenter.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of an unruly expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM radio announcer acted "beyond its obligations."
The consequences for the radio station, which, among other things, had to communicate its decisions once during the main broadcasting time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Algerian origin in Montreal, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thai boxing, is now rising in search of new challenges on the tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing," Zemmal explained, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to further develop among the professionals.
Personally, I am looking for the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he had given his rivals bad news at the World Amateur Championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October, as well as two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA).
"I have won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"At the moment, I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"Those fighters from each category who had placed themselves among the first four at the last World Championship had been invited."
"I got babe in 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"In 2005 I became eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China in which blows and kicks as well as floor throws are permitted.
The competitions usually take place on a platform, less frequently in a boxing ring.
The most prestigious boxing fighter, who emerged from this kind of martial arts, is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to retain only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the super tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the likeable Pound Guy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before he lost in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category stand up to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1 A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, there is a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a companion to Hydro-Québec's decision to give the private sector its responsibility to deliver this important hydroelectric project to the tune of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois parti, recourse to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that creates the risk of distortion of competition and increases in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a setup and defusing the competition."
"This means that instead of playing cards, you are now performing games in an open form instead of in a secret way," said Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to this in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a set-off game.
"I remain faithful to my lineage," she warned, encouraging that the PQ was "in dishonest" and "missing her of hardship."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium's model is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is in progress and is expected to be established by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competition being able to take place; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, even in relatively simple projects, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflight of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, and also Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of it, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As far as the "Énergie gérance" consortium is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has paid special attention to this fact since the 1970s."
Réal Laporte, the great employer of Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the point that the project management contract has been approved by agreement.
"If you make an invitation to tender and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will go up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mart and tell yourself that you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte affirmed.
This contract, approved by the consortium "Énergie gérance," is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, were granted between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had secured 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance."
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally connected with the companies that "financed" it before she specified that it was their managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label is not a source of confidence
Green, but unwound skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither in the marked brands nor in the eco-labellings that are to control his choice.
Too bad, even though it bathes in a media-efficient universe, where there is only so much information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain of a lack of credible information, a inadequacy that identifies itself as a brake on its commitment, as shown by the first reading held yesterday.
Although they promoted the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebec still seems to be paying little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population admits that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies, nor do they believe in green corporate advertising, so the instrument of measurement, developed by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke, reveals.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates, which are supposedly attached to fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which declare themselves environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
Following the same pattern, the politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this segment of consumption, which is currently being revived by almost one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and dubious character of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the declared performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from merchants in their neighbourhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a maximum of 64 of 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and environmental awareness seems to stop ahead of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have stated that in 2010 they used public transport or preferred the car-sharing centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return it to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they requested.
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower level than the initially hoped level, which could create a viable solution on favourable conditions, at least according to the sources extracted from the state rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, and the request has been corrected down again by the sum.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who manages the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final substantive report.
However, the cabinet's counterproposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to reply to them.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec community of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there, which he had not also provided to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment claimed substantial economic assistance.
Following the self-financed construction of the cinema, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years under great difficulties, which could justify the exceptional position of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele on the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, for their part, are driving a privately funded campaign, from which they hope for a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one single screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux."
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not call off the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignore what he and his group think of the downwardly corrected proposals made to them.
Mystery of the complexly shaken Canada
The new American diplomatic leaderships spread through WikiLeaks reveal the mystery of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but at the same time reveal the superiority of the latter towards Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind during the election process, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content that has to be nibbled.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal electoral campaign was in full swing, reports at which point the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador appointed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A low-value complex almost inherent in the Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about everyday issues than to shift black Peter to the United States in this election (as in the Free Trade Campaign in 1988), " he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too menacing to speak of it. "
The ambassador understands this "stupid silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he says, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the electorate has in mind as a key factor at the ballot."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the communication sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's continued confidence vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade due to a $30-40 billion recovery program," Breese says.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties in this way would have an impact on the quality of the proposed stimulus programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Aar, the "No-Fly-List" or even abductions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by the CIA's muscle protruding.
Another communication tells us in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual "case on case" decision.
À at the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed over to the State Secretary a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, let's note that the minds are heating up regarding the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close advisor to Stephen Harper, had explained through CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "moved."
He had lectured here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (CFCs), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction commitments from industrialised countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs emitted on the ground due to lighting if white-glowing pears, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, light emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, this balance would still have to be deducted from 5 Gt in order to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-glowing pears 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced twice as much.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a whitening pear, which conveys an indication of the savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves, because they contain mercury and therefore they have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for producers who provide a reception point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury in order to generate the electricity wasted by the white-blooded pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast excitedly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast immediately after its expiry.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press spokesman of the UN Chief.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had let the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight pass three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become louder that the CEI may at last proclaim the name of the winner of the second round under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp anticipates the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "false" votes in the north by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, confirmed that the FN's manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's actions were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contrasts are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results as "inconvenient" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results, knowing that he had lost; and that a complaint was filed before the Constitutional Court after the electoral commission had been prevented from publishing the results was illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that for years had been divided into two parts.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for this in the event of any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments to 9.7%), according to the International Labour Office (IAA), the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee show.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis stands at 2.631 million.
Data for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and to 9.7% including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million people in employment in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find work, including whether they were fit to work every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points seen within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people aged 15-24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of those over 50, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a discussion of its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste management company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), and he was sent to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of social assets, embezzlement of general property, mischief, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading fantasies."
"It's easy to subject him to a series of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had stressed the importance of providing the judge with a memoradum for his justification before his hearing with his lawyers.
A member of Guérini's family, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill running.
According to Simon, he would never have been aware of the business competence area or the destination of the related funds.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the metropolitan area of Aubagne, was also charged with embezzlement and complicity on Wednesday, but was then released under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to explain the facts he was accused of."
"The Chief Prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been charged and released from custody on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, said Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery."
Two civil servants from the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Backing and embezzlement of general property by a public service official," the other on the grounds of "co-operation in embezzlement of public funds."
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "healing and embezzling social assets."
Among the people faced by Guérini are Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned because of a similar affair of fraud involving Corsica.
The Falcons suspect his society to have helped to wash money from "high " criminal circles.
The investigation against X for suspected fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the field of disposal, was conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
It can be seen from close sources that the study focuses particularly on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill site in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "espionage," kept the French public in breath, put diplomacy on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received from WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained his strategy to the Americans, which went so far as to give advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage" in Iran (a small group of wanderers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman did not bring about the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary on the basis of trade in material for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put in a bright light the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way in which hostages are handled."
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do their utmost to bring back their own nationals who were forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without interruption" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do this."
Because "silence solves nothing," past the discussions about inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common Iranian tactic": " Hostage for the purpose of political extortion."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to take place on August 16, the day she flees to the French Embassy) "requires the Iranians to pay a large sum of money" (230,000 euro bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates more hostages, a phenomenon that "will intensify."
The Iranians could " arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from custody following a decision by a judge in Paris.
Like many other observers, the American Embassy raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, following the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French woman ?
On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, hangs up again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare his efforts to believe that Syria's President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influenced mediator" role by means of statements and media-organized "escape attempts."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media flash of the French authorities."
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall victim to this fiction.
He analyses the intensive communication efforts "with a view to confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria."
A policy launched in 2008, which "was perceived as premature and undeserved by many critics in France and abroad."
"Building up the Syrian role" Paris tries "to show Syria what praise it is possible to achieve by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also "to sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least create confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella," which will forbid the young people to play online games after midnight by blocking access to them, so government officials indicated.
A draft law to encourage online gaming operators to deny young people under 16 years of age access to these games after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, describing representatives of ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties with learning at school and also with living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Ministerial Officer of the French press agency Agence France Presse, responsible for this draft law.
The online games are then available again from 6 a.m. onwards.
The producer companies would have one year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also considered asking manufacturers to lower the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the person in charge added.
He would also make free programmes available to those who wish to be able to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games compared to 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
The FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political election in which the strangling for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Katar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of election.
The Sunday Times, which stood at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have just as well ruined the chances for their own country, cradle of football, which was only allowed to hold the world championship once, namely 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had given it another breeding ground by broadcasting a documentary report that fired three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who had mainly been lobbying intensively with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a new edition of the chess move, which was successful by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had managed to organize the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to revalue England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack any trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which has become an important outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unwavering reference to the accusations made by the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the committee.
"You throw dirt at them, you try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA's eager approval of the World Cup 2026 for China, which makes the Asian opportunities for 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all registers with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Like Japan and South Korea, Australia could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by European countries (due to the time lag), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: disclosure
De Gaulle had really cut.
Mitterand had made him think he was quitting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed no hesitation at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the disclosure is not good on the side of the mystery attached to the presidency function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
On the one hand, as well as on the other.
In 2006, supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011."
The fact that on Tuesday evening at the Elysée in front of the UMP Parliamentarians he would sound the perspective of "two mandates" had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president merely pointed out that the 2008 Constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year terms of office to just two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You still have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the phase afterwards."
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but no less.
Should they create comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which exhorts many members of the PS earlier than accepted to the campaign announcement.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," reacted directly and cautiously to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he found a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin informs.
"He will always believe in being able to win," Alain Juppé corrects, who has agreed to the disclosure.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to an end at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to no doubt fail to cope with today's more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause them to deteriorate.
The political costs would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving Europe's public debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the central bank can do even more, for example by stimulating its programme of buying in government bonds.
"I keep my considerations for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the day before in Brussels, during his hearing with the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, had not shown himself very eloquent about his plans, but rather was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would "continue" and that we at the meeting on Thursday "will see what the decisions are."
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury's bond purchases were doubled from the ECB last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, it was supposed to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
Since May 2010, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros.
There is no doubt about the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price among traders (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable change in course.
If the bond operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be able to create unlimited reserves of funds in a generous manner over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already considering that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions on the sovereign debt market, Norbert Bräms adds, "the ECB should maintain such a purchase volume of bonds that revives the sluggish market."
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must take the place of the lack of investors on the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the rash enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest states," said a key bond holder yesterday.
After all, when interest rates start to rise, states would be even more hindered from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking cover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation yesterday was a little relaxed with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person immediately denied.
At any rate, on Tuesday, the German interest rate scissors would have reached their 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed itself as "seriously concerned" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dizzying tax inputs, which put the state at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected in the future... although the Senate budget is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil surrounding a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating this for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, assures, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short-term nor in the long-term, since Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is required to make lower stabilization progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the early elections to be organised by the end of March.
So there is a little favorable period for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it clear yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it was proved on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency."
Although completely relative - yesterday's deduction from the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to speak of a start of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, probably the most effective target for speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly affecting banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially since "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets."
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and in the broader sense with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
This also applies to Eurogroupe and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan is the lot of unconventional measures to back up eurozone countries in the crosshairs of markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The first Werpapier expenditure by the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative had entrusted the agency to Reuters, and the United States supported a possible increase in funds mobilised by the IMF's additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are in turn preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to the austerity measures, but are expected to have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other are at all costs to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budgetary corrections and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, talk about the options available to speed up the normalization process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way to Paris on 24 November, had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take up its own pocket again.
The economists of Barclay's Capital, with regard to the market for European public debt, judge that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This appropriation exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board with all the opportunities to be studied carefully in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are increasing.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange alert level
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in an orange alert due to the threat of snow and freezing.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic obstructions and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac lines.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the transport police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER coaches was cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardie, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The Prefecture "requires drivers to take the utmost care on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly. "
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) invited airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Roissy airport in Paris on Thursday and 10% of the flights departing from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in South London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry in the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, it is worth recalling the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital envelope of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to lend a portion of the financial sum in the markets at twice as much.
Today, the first projections have finally been made.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two types of measure: the creation of a special tax for the development and the increased taxation of the offices in Ile-de-France.
According to Article 15 of the draft law, the former goes "for the benefit of the Société du Grand Paris.
This figure is as follows: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a reorganisation of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to deliver this increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would that contribute?
A mystery.
This sum is not given in the text.
You're a long way from the four billion.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital envelope raised by the State and gradually paid to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," explains the explanatory statement.
With the SGP you don't find this system offensive.
"Since the moment when income is recorded (the two taxes, i.e. R.), one can cover the project over three years and then draw only from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to write down the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billions are promised, can still be sought for a long time, runs the risk of causing a rather lively parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Ravenish hackers and busy spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has two meanings.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs the relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go one after the other.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits throw away nothing but what has been read for months anyway in every random journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly caricaturated profile of Gaddafi's has long offered cabaret artists material for their sketches.
The rule that the secret files may consist of only known news is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will realize that every work (via the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicreuzler) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (or because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm, what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Just like the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the chief of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who considers only what he acknowledges to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, was the same as that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why has such a fuss been made about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an arbitrary hacker can tap into the secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world carries a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal brings less the victims, rather than the " executioners" into trouble.
But let us dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, all power could be combined like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
However, if one considers what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control course ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold itself that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free from secrets, since it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to deprive them of all power.
WikiLeaks didn't do Sarkozy or Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this insult that has been inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer provide any reserved information online - that would be like an outpost glued to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies it is in vain to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future, only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself forced to imagine the government agents moving in a secret way diligently on uncontrollable marching routes, carrying their communications nowhere else than in mere memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe sales.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically Watergate's espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like cancer these days, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film tape by tape, by rewinding from the back to the front and revealing all the secrets of assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
High-speed trains run from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it takes three and a half hours by plane including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that call for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France talks about its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or "premature financing") implemented by developing countries.
And already the rough French fairy tales are uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners of the fact that they are committed to fast-start financing: detailed action report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
The transparency operation is remarkable and especially appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, leading it on the right track to pay respect for its 7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional commitment has been made without being detrimental to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark they consider best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as the benchmark for 2009: international financing will be maintained and will add 150 million for three years under the "Fast Start" financing.
Other countries have adopted similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of official development aid.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no benchmarks in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of official development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France states that it is committed to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 borrowed € equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro, which is to be taken as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU to use loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) pursue 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 on fulfilling its obligations, France is giving just 10 cents and means a comparable use.
Beautiful hocuspocus!
All in all, in its fast-start financing, France operates with a double fraud: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once internal to the EU (why do the other member states continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter on early financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another issue that is crucial and currently under discussion): one cannot escape the question of "predictability" or the way in which its loans are recorded.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive in terms of the issues involved as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast-start and its vision of "predictability" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base needed for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed do not reflect a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration of the problem being dealt with," had bought the food usually consumed by an approximately ten-year-old child during meals between July and September, plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were examined as well as pastries from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 were considered possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrininin störfaktor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually consumed substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of the cases, this survey is very well understood that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrininin storking factor is worrying," the association notes.
At breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three have been proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, in which the study found traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, tuna from the can, even the baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were also spit.
In the case of tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "richest" and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unburdened.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer is "probably undervalued," according to the study.
In turn, the Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, "in view of the urgency of the situation," to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilisational diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticide residues identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
