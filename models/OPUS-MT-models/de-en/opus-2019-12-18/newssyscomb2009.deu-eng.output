The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties in the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought, after the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the verge.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the People's Party, which demanded the early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had quit the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the initial reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. a renewal of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) for the time being received 18 per cent, the BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had reached agreements with the populists (then the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party, obviously relies on this development and assumes a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party also moved into parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent hurdle and therefore did not join Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of illegal collection of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that a certain cooling-off of Czech-Indian relations could occur.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not resolved, then surely, then there will be some cooling down," he explained after a meeting, which took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of all this, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government wanted to have the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi's view would be best if he went to a higher court to appeal.
He could ask for bail and wait for his sentence in freedom, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same opinion during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be possible for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is by encouraging the convicted "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such aid was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, the Czech press agency ČTK said that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
The Minister did not reply to the question whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he merely stated.
A Czech judges about wrestling around the bottom of the sea
It approaches an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent sea bottom.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-strong staff of the UN Divison for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His boss, Division Director, Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and supplements it on and on.
Here work elan and enthusiasm prevail.
The bottom of the sea has so far contained a little known world rich in natural springs.
This is where oil can be found, as well as ore and other non-growing raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A sea bottom larger than the mainland
The neighbouring countries today vehemently announced their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers from the shores of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly expressed, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the seashore, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful," Mikulka adds.
An international echo has recently been met by Australia's success, which was the first country to significantly expand its maritime areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea floor, which was approved by the Commission last week, amounts to about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The gains that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have invaluable value.
Further States will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do so for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which the Convention calls "the common heritage of humanity."
No state has a special position here anymore.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution set up by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold mining land," says Mikulka, a little exaggeration, adding that "the individual areas of the seabed are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal."
In 1991 it was granted the status of a so-called "groundbreaking investor" by the Convention, as did the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area under investigation by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is structured there, it is a kind of Tatra on the bottom of the sea.
"You can promote there on an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich find of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another jurist, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary shem that, according to legend, brought the golem to life.
German special forces were present at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the flight crew of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as logistics experts of the Technical Relief Agency were at the place of liberation.
On Monday evening, however, spokespersons from the ministries also reported that the German forces were not needed because the hostage-keepers let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as support forces on the ground.
"Luckily it didn't happen," said a spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on September 19th.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage owners remained unclear until the very last time, as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
In Berlin there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress has made the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets very short of failure.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all appeals by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program to contain the chaos on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, supporters had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to vote in favour, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke down by more than six percent or 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure became known, he fell again.
Experts are now expecting further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
Both the House of Representatives and the Senate need approval for the programme to enter into force.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans' desire to travel remains undisturbed according to a study.
For the bookings for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, higher booking figures are already available for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in sales of travel agencies in October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV informed.
The basis for these results are GfK figures, which evaluates monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and is highly charged for the overall market.
The travel bookings carried out until the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the USA in particular is in demand, the DRV informed.
Here the booking increase amounts to around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic areas of the Germans, are particularly sought after destinations.
In particular, package travel would be very popular, explained DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs here are "better calculable for the customer than for individually organized holidays."
Among other things, consumers could save money through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there would again be an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans making a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter jars and celebrities in designer dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: Hardly three minutes on the meadow, the photographers plunge on us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first Wiesn visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Weißwurstäquator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited to date.
Once arrived on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reaps my dirndlschürze.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I had tied the apron incorrectly: "Left host frei, Mitte Jungfrau, rechts vergegeben, hinten verwitwet."
I secretly frieze the loop from back to left.
"Fits," said it, laughing.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked back to an uninvited one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a long-drawn "oooo."
That's what he tells me after getting rid of his previously drunk measurements.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks he's a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous Wildbieslers.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in crowds across the festival square, who have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at once carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works like with most visitors to Wiesn: Empty back, full back.
You can't see who's under the tarp in the promille coffin.
"These are the things that goarnimmer pack," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the tumult.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspecting reckless driving.
Meanwhile, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits riddling at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front and looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is disintegrating about
But once you're inside the arched ticket desk, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project, the most western access this was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late-flyer in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and further beyond what Saudi Arabia is today.
But during the First World War Germany's imperialist plans were framed.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable borders of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and urged the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly decayed, gone far beyond history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling judicial and development party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighbouring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I have boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail," I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state project to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
But the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused a lot of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a specially designed ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even grabbed a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exceptional phenomenon," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could eventually," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "would not have to face up to this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in a figurative sense, Europe as a whole can travel east to Asia and the Middle East on the same railroad tracks.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had been watching this building build 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962 Vernon "Death" Handley (obituary on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether it was a capella or full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chore was often astonishing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never left behind for years.
How often did death stop us from "letting music speak for itself."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never gorgeous but never overflowing.
However high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years or so, I've written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by a single one - I've often been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
According to his words, he loathed the conductors "with one or two well-known showhorses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950... while at the same time studying for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End," but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry."
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, as they always deal with respect for the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda catches up with the marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large saloon offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are the technical subtleties that allow even more comfortable driving and fuel saving.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made in this large saloon are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time compared to the other producers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon concerning its sale in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10,000 cars, 17% of the assumed growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the managers of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the decline in sales in Spain.
In reality, the brand's leaders hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is an Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous Jazz model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 liter petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 liter petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, except for the additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to seating is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 turns with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Car bee' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight dates back to the swarming behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight room, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facets of the bee, which can see at an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows her to fly undisturbed in her personal airspace without interruption.
The technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF) in order to recreate the all-round perspective.
He notices obstacles located in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an in-vehicle microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal to avoid the collision
'In the moment that obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning his wheels around 90o or even greater angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasive manoeuvre is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can't deviate up or down, but it can't move over; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels, not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way, as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
'This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and to act on it.
It does not require to store neither the information nor the intuitive logic of the maneuvers made, therefore it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in the next ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, in order to lead to the goal while driving while avoiding the obstacles along the way.
She's shaking before she's charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognised that the US Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid US citizens being involved in mortgage stories of supposedly solvent banks, an entertaining and informative game for Internet surfers has been developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it is said.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, two and up to three times if it is the moment not to ask for a loan.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for the teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, if a fantastic room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG)'s entry into its business, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its stock market price.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a uniform price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The price assumed is less than 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be made on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
However, the Morgan Stanley share declined by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to holding bank status," said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which will allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
'A week ago', in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, said, 'we thought the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will take place with a reduction in profit of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into common shares if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% above the selling value within a given period, i.e. at approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to make use of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, one of the group's spokespersons refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan stated that he had 'clearly' lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group, who had to watch their stock market price fall by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency rose.
This price went down on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had taken 15 billion dollars, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was that third party who this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded and friends, put the plan of a new constitution to the vote.
According to the public results of 80% of the vote, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a census of a non-governmental organisation had announced a clear victory for 'yes' and predicted it to be 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday Rafael Correa, by the way, had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence according to the observational order of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it with the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that largely lives from oil production by foreign companies and foreign currency, which sends emigrants to the country.
The project, promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the Head of State greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country, with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
In the end, it also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were liberated in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and unharmed.
In the morning, they had been liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived at the Al-Maza military base right next to the Cairo International Airport at about 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi hospital, a foreign quarter of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and the kidnappers 'no ransom was paid', said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the runway.
After being captured on September 19 at a SUV safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place by 35 unknown hijackers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the Special Forces, on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
'On both sides shots were shot and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this person in charge who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is now, on the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces have played.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence and special forces', he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the evening before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in a patrol where the kidnappers were, of which they killed six, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is the central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are miserably starving?
What politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no real laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
With our American neighbours, it is written in their country's constitution that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the American culture and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in mutual consultation.
In Quebec, in the Association of the Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, to save the numerous private archives with a few pennies, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when supporters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which is in turmoil as a result of the US financial crisis: The three states make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the banking and insurance institute, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed this weekend at the highest level, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the European Commission's competition authority.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its stakes, above all the insurance activities purchased by ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep descent last week, and serious crisis scenarios were already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The Institute's securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to management.
The management believes that the USD 700 billion American bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is to blame for the decline of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, tried to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, they said.
So far, no panic has broken out among the customers, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own branches, but it also names leasing companies as its own.
Fox in the henhouse
Because of a person's drug use, life and health insurance in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the chickens to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies determine the fees and the payment amounts in the event of damage depending on the customer's health, and if the risk is too high, the insurance will not be completed.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only with the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Using the customer's identification number, he obtains the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e., which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates the disease the customer suffers from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering drugs, it might be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically place him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance companies only have to do the paperwork more, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraines and hot flushes, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer's point of view, while the ones mentioned above are not.
For the consultation and processing of the data, our own societies have formed, which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
They now have to do this by law, even though omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and combine them with the data on drug use. Thus, they provide an even more accurate picture of the patient's state of health.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, it has an impact only on health service providers and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard admits that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question, of course, is that the data subject can hardly prohibit access to his data, since otherwise the insurance companies do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to the Fox's mercy.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main topic among other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, too, the French-Indian summit is being held, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more voices and voices in international concerns, the member states have not yet been able to agree whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council, or not.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. increase it to a good EUR 100 billion.
Given that the exchange of goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even as ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally combined into an agreement, so that aviation will also be encouraged in the future.
By 2009, India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance between the EU and India: while the Union is the number one partner in India, New Delhi is only 9th among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned. Also the convening of a UN conference was Urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for its failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, i.e. to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as did the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the next climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion are hoped for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will distribute over 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia."
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases throughout the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The small aircraft of billionaire Steve Fossett, which disappeared a year ago, was recovered
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, no human remains were found.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely refuted the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located and a troop has been sent out. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Traffic Safety (Ntsb) reported that a crew was sent out a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, which identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had started a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two identity cards named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he was the first person to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world on a single flight without a stopover by airplane.
Among his several records is also a high-altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, which however with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ads you don't expect
A suv that falls out of the conventional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles.
With this offroader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
Due to its exceptional features, the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
The promotional drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign - a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in various casks, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, by 15 November.
The first case will consist of the presentation of the car in form, whereby 3D glasses, which are distributed near the Corso Como, will give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in all its details in different moments in order to re-establish itself as a whole.
Without a doubt, the aim of Mercedes with this advertising is to introduce a new type of car advertising into this more stereotyped field.
But will it succeed in stimulating the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto - now they risk stadium ban
Who are only those 150-200 boys and girls for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia," which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The conveyors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia joined them in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all of them were issued in names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those traveled to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this respect, were denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified in the riots can count on a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans won't put a foot in a stadium anymore.
Lucky for you.
But now, of course, there is fear of copycats who could follow little more than 150.
"This fire must be withdrawn immediately, and in no way give such behaviour the opportunity to justify it," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "Eyes on especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Indeed, in Apulia there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sports Authority), on Tuesday, the Casms gathers, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime" ...
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed without joy) who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but this behaviour of these 150-200 people was undoubtedly a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio - crimes are punished in the country of their act.
So far, this group had kept in check, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But let's also talk about the whistles during the anthem of Mamelis: this is not a criminal offence either, but allow me, there is still a lack of education."...
