In the afternoon another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not compete for the romantic candlelight shoot before the MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, flirting, seducing - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Munich" candidates deliver in shooting with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is available in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the soccer podcast "Phrase mower" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-times national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be so," said Grindel.
In July, the 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team and justified it by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to put up any pressure, but he knew it from soccer so that when "you leave a team or change clubs, you talk about it with his coach and I find it a shame that this conversation has not yet come about."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2.13 p.m. the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a power line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in arrears.
The fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically to the full and fire shreds had to be removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had connected a battery to the store at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined, as well as the cause of fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collector's items in his garden hut.
Angry Mother Retreats: Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on Open Street
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has himself streamed live as she apparently wants to take the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family, which she wants to identify as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of engaging in child trafficking.
She doesn't provide any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan is heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she's trying to separate the kids from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and losing Lohan a slap.
With tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is intended to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign tickers: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated and cut off areas from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning was a tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets when he announced the withdrawal of the Eletro car manufacturer.
The U.S. stock office sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Congress
Sharply guarded - the party congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit-Hardlins, at the forefront of former foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doublings for years.
Now they've come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called Northern Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore in the lead in the polls.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer of the Automotive Week.
Rupert Stadler, head of Audi's detention and leave of absence, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gearbox combinations are expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "engraving organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi CEO of having approved the sale of Dieselautos with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas scams become known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot is head of the company as acting CEO.
Due to the switch to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there are production failures at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner Voice."
Basically, he sees a falling demand for saloons such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm shall enter the DFB-Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - In spite of the criticism of his person after the World Championships and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB President again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio."
You have to keep trying to re-elect, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "noteworthy" if he did not have "lust to work on the future project" after the bid for the football championship in 2024.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, future EM director Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise on this role in the Bureau in the future and then of course be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently this office of the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has familial roots in Cameroon.
"If someone is clearly involved in society and football without a migration background and says, "the issue is important, we have to take care of it," Grindel said, it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration has to work."
Take off properly with half-wise scales
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index is also calculated by the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
Doesn't he say anything about replacing fat with muscle?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
==Career statistics====References====External links==*Official website==External links==*Official website
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the dominant Berliner with 20 points of top scorer.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators in his mandatory play debut.
Former Champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg-Professor Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.

New national player Karim Jallow was the best shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
The basketball lions Braunschweig had a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to hand over the Gülen movement's supporters living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were deployed - including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is in criticism because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Cries and Secrets
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted greater commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, 'cause I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage during the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a shocking second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shooting, got scared and tried to escape.
Shortly, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - but bushes for the Republican senator Jeff Flake.
Although he and his democratic colleague Chris Coons spoke out on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, pushing many women in front of their heads.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women who, according to their own information, had themselves experienced sexual assaults confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the audience at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends ejection of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore arranged for the protection of persons to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested only at the beginning of September.
Recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, trials are still ongoing in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The NDR-produced talk show "Inas Nacht" is known for humid conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten."
Moderator Ina Müller joins her guests with a lot of beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory vocal contributions.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies such as "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horniest Day."
The Munichner didn't get the trip to the far north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely cracked on it, his eyes only two little slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just got a powerful hangover.
To his fans he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And splash.
And leave the round egg liqueur that Ina throws at half past three.
The drinking is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight after-work.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - presumably the most targeted - headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nocturnal drinking is not known so far.
However, as she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and garbage
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway bike path in the Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa is difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Cullet, cigarette dumps, garbage and garbage, demolished garbage bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship object Bahnradweg in the Red Riding Hoodland a more than infamous sight.
The topic is occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the cycling officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Council.
There was no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the transfer of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the topic to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the tables are also destroyed: posts are torn out of the earth, trash cans are demolished, signs are knocked over, seats are smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also worried about the new bike site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she's making the same fate, it's gonna be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this will set the threshold much higher to attack common property.
However, this would require a police patrol to stop by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes for a development of the Haaße hill.
He had to be made more attractive.
One could be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still viable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in Ascheröder Street in Treysa.
There's no turning track on the Haaße hill.
In case of busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flow on both sides," she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but for older drivers and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in common.
" D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians."
A contest "with winks in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What were the copywriters connected to?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the villages.
Rolf Himmig named the avenue in his hit song "Kö von Hiltrup."
The Kulturbahnhof was also honored.
Time and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short renovation breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
Franke knew from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a big BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all sorts of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a whole CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children performed again for the finale - and even sounded "real good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords can be deciphered - the old trick with the red foil - only after you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side can read nothing even by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Two windows.
Three dice.
Fourth feast.
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because not the terms, but codes are to be guessed here.
Alternating one player per team is the encryption.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto" the terms behind the secret film should not be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube," "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and if possible does not recognize the opposing team; because this wins the game if he succeeds in cracking the code twice.
So the encrypter writes down and reads loudly: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to feast; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he took care of the school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round for round, team for team.
You don't know the terms of the opposite side - but you can combine them better with every clue the encrypter gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the rewrites should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video on decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as coherent as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames," which also puts an agent's theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's just about guessing and not about winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper City of a passing police patrol, later he also noticed in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic, he did not follow the assigned place reference by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be liable for the use of registration plates of unconstitutional organisations.
Betriebswerk Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
==References====External links==* Official website
"When buffers slammed at buffers, it was heard all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the station.
It didn't upset anyone.
There the brakes squeaked and grabbed the wagons.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres.
In order to handle this, trains and drawers used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901 the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, overhead line and railway mastery.
"Heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway operator for 47 years.
From the BW Pressig railway depot, which was subordinate to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives were also operated for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 onwards, they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10,000 weighing units were still placed in the month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were demolished, in 1991 the rest of the plant was demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not envisage a better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport."
At Whitsun 1989 the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary "50 Years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On June 1st, 1991, the last 30 men were pulled off, and the Pushig marshalling station was history.
"The marshallers and retarders did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Sinkel.
Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing, as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russians placed at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Pleasure," a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather, when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and pleasure."
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great appeal to visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good perspective for the future.
Both have already played an active role in the selection of artists in the past and helped shape flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at any art station.
This year's poster "Dance Betzn out," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high acceptance of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical frame.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor is waiting for the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau on the right side of the "Glücksbaum."
It is a tree stump, brightened in color, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object looks magical and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to devote himself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
Halfway through Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "wind play performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachten also aired their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept partout, that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch they took the MGV 68 Albachten out of the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting."
"It's gonna be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
On the occasion of the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothes had previously been.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Meeting," but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the sliders and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made the voice sound themselves.
Matching the occasion were cheerful songs.
Almost set: "As a day, as beautiful as today."
In line with the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops."
Once again the choir management of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at that time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiebe said: "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he does." Incidentally, this time not only men presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
After all, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the Allwetterzoo.

Volleyball: 3rd league women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascendant is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in league three.
No sign of shyness or fracking, the independents do their thing.
And this is really good at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game checked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring this to the goal, such a game can already tilt once," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We all know who's standing in such a derby on the other side.
It's not gonna break our necks.
I've seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker didn't quarrel with the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents goes, after just three days of playing does not seem foreseeable.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball." They don't want to look down into the fourth league anyway.
Should the vest not be soiled in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about the fact that the show might have had a complicity in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1st, 2018, she left the ship forever.
The series, which made her a star, could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," Keller tells in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday."
At first she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that had changed with the "dreamship."
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so much, I don't know."
She thinks it's possible that her husband at the time might have been envious, but "how many men also shied away from Hans' conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have changed," as she further explains.
She always felt that she was "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman whom I in truth never was, even though I sometimes appeared bold and bold on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I was sitting in the dressing room crying and wanting to cancel everything.
==References====External links==
Why didn't it ever work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At that time, Keller had imagined love as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love too naively."
The night moth, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ-resort Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the bright shine in which a green carpet has immersed itself in the square of the six-sealings, blinds it exceedingly.
But it's just film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he staggers over the square to ease himself briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis."
This is what the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company is called, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks to heaven in the men's oasis for some reason.
So get out here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book," celebrate as every year the festival begins with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: the works shown are known to originate from all over the world.
What you don't have to think of in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into stealthy advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a small volume around the feelers, which has attached a good fairy to it, and two bully doormen actually wave him in in a very generous way.
Inside, the invited crowds push themselves, dance far after midnight to live music or let themselves be imagined by DJ rhythms to which they yell at each other, and rinse down with Cupli exquisite appetizers.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters wait for sloping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut open, a chocolate fountain bubbling.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the shield at the escalator: "Watch a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If that's two separate instructions, he's lost himself in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tips a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who's been promoting that brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But since, between local celebrities, cash desks and kitchen articles, a face that is familiar to the observer moves by: Peter Farrlly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor shouldn't be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd with almost sixty almost acting like a choir boy.
He's not being talked about, he's not being grieved, he's being scolded.
Especially for this restraint, like to misunderstand as obsessiveness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona Celebrates Victory in Mexico with Cumbia Dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is pleased with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to Cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican second division had defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my guys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last minute bust "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His protégés were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - broke - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night with LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly for long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we slept totally," the ASV trainer was annoyed.
The householders quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not at first fruit.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, arrived at the same time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor's perspective.
After 33 minutes David Ernst compared to 15:15, then the relay changer led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
The unpartisans intervened.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for guilt with others.
But: The 120-second penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and met four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The guys fought great, stood well against seven guys in the back and threw them on the empty goal again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory must come," Bieletzki said.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Missing woman for 30 years - Police digs by body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila, Hof County, the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
Forces dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
To this end, the street flooring and several layers of it were removed, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new findings, the missing persons may not have been buried far away from their place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not exclude a crime at that time either.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working together with the Public Prosecutor's Office on the case again, according to information.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an eye-catching under the street near Marxgrün using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bordered the site at a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk also gives up the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Supervisory Board Chairman.
He may remain head of the board.
In the comparison, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in front of the U.S. federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also in charge of space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed in the complaint.
He had always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he would perhaps take the company off the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share, the financing being secured.
In total, Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

"Let's Dance"-Juror Joachim Lambi and Mrs Ilona separated
I think Joachim Llambi broke up with his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known for the RTL show "Let's Dance."
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt) reports on the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert, citing Llambi's lawyer.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the quirks of recent weeks, the GroKo collects several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a meter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest level for the Union in the Sunday trend to date.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP reach 10 percent.
According to Emnid, if Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes.
This means that the great coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
Together, they received 53.4 percent in the 2017 Bundestag election.
With the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, the second strongest party in several surveys, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, while the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the percentage of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the large coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also revealed significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also judge splitly whether Merkel should run again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
Therefore, 64 per cent of the Union's supporters want a candidacy, 35 per cent do not want it.
Showroom at Aldi: Reduced price for love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket almost radiates an anachronistic romance as a place to get to know the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargain at the mill table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app stands in the reputation of being less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We have dared the test: How do women react, one in the first message does not talk about the hot porridge for long?
Here's the amazing result.
Rule-right Hollywood lovestory potential has it then, if the love happiness precedes an out-of-eye-lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then even at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de reports to his worshippers, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she talked briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic puten meat."
She definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for her belief in the magic of analog acquaintance.
Billerbeck: 500 covers for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been involved in the action "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Lid für eine Leben ohne polisamen" (Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Lid for a life without polio).
Polio is the abbreviation for poliotoxin, an infectious disease caused by poliovirus.
The disease described in German as polio leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany polio is considered extinct, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliotoxins, the polioviruses, can only be contained by vaccinations, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for goddess
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sport Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," said Reus, a friend of Götze's, after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard to court with his own.
==References====External links==* Official website* Official website* Official website* Official website* Official website* Official website
It's all history.
Meanwhile, it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer Einscheicht ist das 1:1 am Sonntag gegen den SC Altenrheine, in der vergangenen Spielzeit nur hauchdünn am Ascension geschragt.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual after the match to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly over to a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had much more games in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have been avenged when the SCA in Minute 41 opened up dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Kasten twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his subject.
After the break, the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed barely.
Schroer was also late after 58 minutes with a Thewes entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the courtlords 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The fouled man himself stepped up and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flop hit down left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes, which should go fucking long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room unfortunately at the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange Minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske still had the victory hit on the push in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 pm there was a drama on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, as the police confirmed against oe24.
The heli was captured by a gust of wind, crashed onto the ground and succumbed to lateral succumbing.
Police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately notified.
The forces came to the accident site with a large number of people.
The ÖAMTC emergency doctor helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and could go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigation.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger, there was a small fire of origin, which could be quickly extinguished.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1st, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"Companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them," said foundation managing director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male management teams - with few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive impulses from the medium-sized index (MDax) companies.
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
For the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Every year, when as many women were recruited for the board members, a share of 40 percent would have been reached in 2023," says the report.

Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only reaches around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of weight on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi have an average price of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros earnings before interest and taxes EBIT are good in the race.

Torch train at the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
The Tourist Association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torch train.
For the 60th time the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the big festival tent on the Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the people in charge under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn moved through the place to the festival place.
The chairman of the Tourist Association Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already prolific festival tent. "It's 60 years to do something like this - that's an amazing achievement for a small village with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," he thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically joined the guests from the stage.
"Nice that so many have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "Die Troglauer" caused the mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the drinks prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festival evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before one day later in the festival tent goes into the second round.
In Bonn: Emergency car crashes in taxi
An ambulance is severely damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best save lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an ambulance with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had hit a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then collided at a junction with the taxi that drove at Green.
The doctor's car hurled after the collision against a traffic light mast and a tree.
He captured the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency forces.
The also severely injured 29-year-old emergency doctor could free herself, but the pedestrian could not help her anymore.
Another emergency doctor called here tried to do this - but without success.
The three severely injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, will determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we're uncomfortable
After the blamable end of the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat is likely to give still to speak.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the regenerate Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defense players stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previously long-distance insufficient performance.
The mood at United's City Rivale Manchester City is quite different at the moment.
The Citizens coached by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came to a rough 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the defence bar of the outsider for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former scorer Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer a table leader
Three days after the Ligacup defeat, Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool defeated Chelsea in the Premier League.
Like the Cup-Out, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the remis in the league the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, in whom Granit Xhaka played, had to wait until the 81st minute against the surprise team from Hertfordshire for a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart made an unfortunate entry of Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now immediately behind the big rival Tottenham in fifth place.A strong impression remains of Wolverhampton ascendant under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fifth time in a row at 2-0 against Southampton and took 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in Frankfurt in exchange for the IAA.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the Automotive Salon 2018, they will show their new products from the coming week, together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't really matter anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which until then are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the shiny scenes of the booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have among other things their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstädter is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Officially, they were both presented.
The iNext from BMW is to start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 series.
This year, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years in Frankfurt in exchange for the IAA.
A good one million visitors came in 2016.
At least 380 people have been killed in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, enormous damage to property was caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds had gathered at the beach in the coastal town of Palu for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will rise significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
However, numerous other municipalities are also affected - along Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong bike riders.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, around 150 bikers had gathered on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
Already from 10 o'clock the bolides were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker's early breakfast was on the agenda and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was preached during the Biker-Godly Service by Rev. Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical background was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests rather poetic and calm tones," says Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle divine service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates great festival: After the apple comes the milk
And also at the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his amazed spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how a tasty drink would be made of it.
But they were also able to look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like hackers, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of the work was not so difficult anymore.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had already finished bottled specialties.
He opened his "Schatzkiste" and presented the newest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere the parents came into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of the apple pressing, but also discovered the built bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged themselves during the festival and invited at some stations to entertaining games.
The Heimatverein will also offer a day of action next year.
Then, however, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: Finally, the milk will go around.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season broke: "Fucking situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in succession, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 around and gave them courage.
However, there was a lot of positive things to see before at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96 football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "Of course, that's disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the connection, stand with two counters at the bottom and are in their current constitution a relegation candidate.
Leading by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of Hesse during his start-up debut and never to get under control of Hannover's defense.
The stormer, long after the World Cup, showed with his speed and strength why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebić, the Brazilian Allan, loaned by Liverpool FC, was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began vibrantly.
Lucas Torró's headball (17.) falsified on the goal net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (Back) in the short term.
The guidance for the householders was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty room after a defunct corner, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
==References====External links==*BDFutbol profile*Futbolme profile*Futbolme profile
And Frankfurt followed before the break.
This time, Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully filled himself up and didn't let Michael Esser take a chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played now a bit more courageously forward, but sparking ideas remained until just before the end, when the connecting hit was still successful.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic started a solo and then moved across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
For the Frankfurters, the rest was only show-runs against overcrowded guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes the party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter made it to millions of people at the opening of the 185.

Geisingen: Geising Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on 14 September or on Sunday after that.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Sacred Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier, according to legend.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the sanctuary stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the Cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisingen parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and the final blessing ended the ecclesiastical part of the feast of the Cross.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish home for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until the next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been discovered, which has only been made possible by the appearance by scaffolding.
The pedestal plastering work is finished, the natural stone work is to be started before the winter and one hopes to be able to complete a good half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to its destination - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the dormitory of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Broader corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer's building was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment," explained Bader in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Around 4.6 million euros was invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without any help from others.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the Social Administration of the district of Schwaben, commented similarly: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile."
The homeliness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer to be purchased in today's situation."
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square meters, which are divided into three residential groups.
Pride is Lebenshilfe Managing Director Heinz on the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, deputy SPD chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unit.
We must not be content with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag."
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but get 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has presented South Korean President Moon Jae to two North Korean pungsan hunting dogs.
According to Moon's office on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals to get used to it."
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's Moving History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Picture Book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to the material work - this is the unofficial motto for today's work week of the Grand Coalition.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have last not conjured mantra-like the "return to material work."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what actually is the difference between work and material work, but be it.
When the Federal Government is ready to re-dedicate itself to its mission - to govern - it should not now be prevented by conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last weeks, will probably already be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties come together for the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, conflict-prone issues are again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the expert immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation for technical retrofitting older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned Skilled Migration Act.
The SPD calls for a residence perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be a fight again among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
It is not equal and equal that has joined forces with the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without a dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute must not be raised again for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should fight - but always have the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and beneficial for many?
With this key question, both the question of diesel and the change of lane can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the people's parties must now fight for this.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in sight
Is the Minister of Labour in breach of the applicable civil service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legalists had been working on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste-Milz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is met with astonishment - she now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumes that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and not to announce violations of the applicable civil service rights in front of cameras on-going."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to "acquit Hartinger from any suspicion."
Police tearing up a street in search of women's corpse
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is still closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday.
It had preceded that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow down the relevant spot to a few meters together with his guide in multiple use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument conservation authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year, the prosecutor's office and the criminal police have been working on the missing persons' case.
Again and again a bike path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the Staatsstraße 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists did not forget the police mission of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked with color powder by the advocates of independence, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues with a rally, who were deployed in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was considered illegal.
At that time, violence had also taken place in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, reports Spanish media.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would have violently tried to break through the police chain, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people had been arrested and 24 others had been slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split off the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other separatist activists remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Congregated perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split up torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues on the spot.
==References====External links==*Official website
The final light and the third last one they turned out in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as a assembled perplexity.
The first half was manageable by the entertainment factor.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst could do this without worry.
There was no danger of missing a torchance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle only real - option, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to go to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action consisted of an early change.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters aimed just above the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly presented counter over Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a but a lazy shot in the arms of theRWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also followed with a headball from Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball from the ex-aller Tim Manstein.
Angelo Daut reacted by bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It didn't do anything.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also didn't make any difference.
Afterwards, Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero was standing in the front too.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede and that even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, everything "scattered" against a team that just wanted to defend.
Anyway, I didn't feel like we could get a counter-gate," said Daut.
To his regret, however, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving Market: Luckily there are enough creimers
This is what Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, while the space was still a bit empty, but that was to change in the course of the day.
Because: "It's so nice here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a neat pinch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain the ever-increasing visitors musically in between.
This arrived so well that some folk songs were sung later.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer was happy.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased about the many active people with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually there shouldn't be anything like a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all who were in service at the booths and also included the other festivals and the "Clean Up" campaign that took place in September.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful paint - here's something.
Then the maikranz was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to be had.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decapie saw.
Veneer work, beer cover with Reckenfelder motifs and much more he had on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honig," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honeycake in glass, of course, with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed visitors to linger for a long time until the evening hours, even without the stage programme that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with local political message: No successful advertising for skate systems
In Lengerich, unknown people have advertised for the construction of a skate system in a hardly conducive way.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were displayed on signs, among others, at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the trade fair on September 19, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with an Edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"But a few days later it was there again, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note gets this case precisely by the fact that on the board also several large companies from Lengerich are called.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the municipal department School, Sports and Culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the lubricated board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally spoke out for the majority in favour of the fire brigade parking lot.
However, this suggestion was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now unanimously voted for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council then has the last word.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control congestion gets worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Traffic Control Union, to the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-standing lack of personnel in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots was empty.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone for the monitoring of the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the Federal Government, the Länder, air traffic control, airlines and airports meet in the Hanseatic City on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, that won't work without us," explained the head of the GdF, who has many members in the federal German air traffic control system.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot damage.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings in national air traffic controllers are now fully entrenched in operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not tie down the air further" to air traffic controllers.
At present, the EU's targets would be agreed by 2024 and there would be further intensifications to be feared.
The EU was exposed to constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs of the airlines would lead to a change of thinking.
The GdF would only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offered a "consistent training and future pact," Maas said.
The up to now announced intake of 120 pilot students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim director Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be split up into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the reductions already known in the administration.
After two resignations, the control panel on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the workforce are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
Among other things, the new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will contain the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with its Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of policemen and Catalan supporters of independence.
In two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish policemen and Catalan supporters of independence in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city council, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest trains from each other with a large amount of effort.
However, according to the forces, supporters of independence repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwshots.
Rangelies were also reported to exist between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who almost exactly a year ago opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they've beaten us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is in favour of enforcing our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Pane allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A vulnerability in a mobile phone app has caused the personal data of ministers and members of the conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

Soccer: Juve coach praises after top: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star stormer "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important match against the persecutor even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to the three goals of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early lag by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst persecutor for the time being.
The goaltender, who was brought by Real Madrid, first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And after a corner by headball Ronaldo also did the preliminary work on the hit of Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who only had to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving it," demanded the coach.
Best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years has already scored six points ahead of Naples.
The second division of the table, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to go against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the place after getting too hard.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed there.
The German national player has won over Juve.
==References====External links==*Official website*Official website
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flew off the pitch at the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is closed for the home match on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided the audience with frowning and question marks.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From then on, let him be called "Ye," according to the musician.
"The essence that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in the way of the late singer Prince, when he took off his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
Already the tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you," the rapper says.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more gripper, we almost never put him before problems." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer shot-in possibilities reads thinly.
Grades two chances in 90 minutes, so you can only rarely make games positive.
Football Circle League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Also the SG had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early guidance (7.).
Steffen Uphus could have increased in the 43rd minute, but after great preliminary work by Krause he changed his position freely.
The hosts only had a double option when Moritz Höne failed first at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper in the aftershot.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - could also not use Niklas Eilmann for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other hard before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," said the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he wrangled in words.
"We didn't get access to them at all." He supposedly meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites who noticed with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking boldly and moving from there to his players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class retention.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we return after the 0-2, as we hold against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
It is all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goaltender Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He put the 2-0 over the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was already madness, what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent envylessly.
Shortly before the side change his own elf made the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through the long Toreck (45.).
==References====External links==*Official website*Official website
After that it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later, Patrick Horstmann looked out (69.).
Despite overnumber Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia meeting (80.) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that is what we now have to win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus

Media: Entire Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigns
According to media reports, the entire Bureau of Football Second League player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media spoke in agreement on a joint letter from the Saxony Council.
A confirmation of the association was not available at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga player.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had said that he shouldn't have been invited.
Protestant Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize personally in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn reckoned with him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors were already with us." However, the presentation of the annual programme also included the fact that celebrities have repeatedly appeared at the Academy in Tutzing Castle.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective.On 29 September, the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: he wants to personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives TV presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings until mid-2019 will have it in their own right.
"The pension is just not safe!" says in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "ridiculous and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without a limit."
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - war mocks every humane idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitization.
Akademie director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to search for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits one more visitor of the direction capitalism-criticism, the other a tendency "from left-wing to center."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Protestant Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret testist, Teubner decided on gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes up to the end of the sentence, on the other hand he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies such a congenial harmonically that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, just as it was the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The man's satisfaction comes when he has a partner but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates this: What would have emerged from the composing of Mozart if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp slides over into improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Song of Death," and from Mozart g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was big applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the chansonette.
However, Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not receive any additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We haven't gotten them under control," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
The concentration at the end made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a gap, was at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the broader bank of the hostess make a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschaupt (4), S. Fitzek.

==References====External links==*Official website*Official website
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked this out," coach Dominik Münch was pleased after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The first passage was dominated by the guests almost at will.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-champion of the previous year.
Eating took place in a two-bar, but didn't come into play.
We've been keeping her busy.
Our opponent hit with high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second movement the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has changed the assumption to triple bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Eating sucked in, and we got a little sucked in," continued Münch.
At 18:17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their first noses in front.
Although East Bevern refused four sentence balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the exercise leader found to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "There we played consistently and calmly."
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the Blue-White passage four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) criticized the way in which the great Ditib Mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne left a pile of shards in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be met with difficulty," said the chairman of TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslims' affiliation with Germany alongside German leaders, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The widespread exclusion of the German public had "enforced many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already hosts its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the exact day it is then a year ago that we did a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting would be so fast in Nottuln.
Whether Stormtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The programme at the next Folktreff is as always a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites musicians to Nottuln again and again.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first Folktreff "Birthday."
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff will gladly remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" inspired the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," says the invitation of the home club.
Those who play an instrument and want to participate actively are invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on the way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority had approved the proposed merger, Linde informed on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar merger is still subject to permits in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
Finally, according to an insider, the chances of an agreement had improved there because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October to ensure that the merger succeeds.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the County Association for Horticulture and Land Care was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impulses for the Kulmbach County Association for Horticulture and State Care were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, at that time he was called a different name: As "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was baptized by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the Orchard Association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture no one thought about at that time.
"At that time, in the era of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said district home carer Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees should line highways, and so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 Gartenbauvereine in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A close-to-natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the communication of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürge" showed how diverse the tasks of a gardening association are.
"Jugendarbeit is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt about it even district manager and expert consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He guided the many visitors with a presentation through the long history of the district association and reported among other things on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come out of the garden, and it was fed for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is the incentive for the gardening associations not to slacken, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful festive act, which was solemnly framed by the tower winds of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister issues UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they make both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister would not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen informed.
In the meantime, it focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada's and the US' negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement that had already been reached between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The discussions on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
According to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo," the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the open road at the beginning of September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations mobilized racist and anti-women's statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore must not run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil will take place on 7 October.
As ex-Mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the extreme right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Although the "Trump Brazil" has been involved in the political process for a long time, it is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first round, there will be a runoff election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for rushing against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left workers' party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish Rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on the deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known for the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen as a "roadboy" who was "against everything but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared on the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 2010.
Rock Night at the Shoe Factory: Volume at Presslufthammer Level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a rewriting of the rocking live musician's experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure of three bands with another friend.
After the sound check and just before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - loudly inspire the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening also with new, unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to a harmonious and powerful interplay.
Although "Access" calls are not to be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by changing from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheered-out solo to the sound he feels even higher than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of this, due to the genre of such a hard rock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing console team, the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of compressed air hammers, but is still significantly below the control of the "watching fesitval," which "The Ignition" refers to on its website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume, as is the case with the annual metal setting in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course figuratively, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport a glider crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim/Essen airport.
According to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, a glider crashed at the airport's fair parking lot.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
The aircraft had already arrived at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance away from a festival tent on the airport grounds.
But there has been an Oktoberfest since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the border of the two Ruhr area towns and directly at the entrance to Autobahn 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President of North Korea's ruler Kim is well-sponsored despite the nuclear crisis.
But now Trump has made his colleague a true declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has become known for a new flame.
Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-life of the ruler dynasty from Pyongyang, although he turned out to be a rather tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he too, and it went back and forth between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection had also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announcement to stop all nuclear and rocket tests, even though critics see little more than lip service.
The US president seemed quite aware that the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's nickname for Kim - not everyone should be horrible.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of this at his performance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidial.
But he cares very little, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger to the crowd: "I have always told you it is so simple to be presidential."
But then we wouldn't push 10,000 people out there into this bulging arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and on top of that pampered by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair Baesweiler's city center has cleaned out on Sunday.

Refugees saved from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile video and thus made it possible to save them.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea.
According to his own statement, he put himself in danger of life with the video.
One of his collaborators was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Around 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland with the help of the programme this year, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional with regard to the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a call for help via cell phone video.
International organisations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the elementary school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the forehouse on the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a stairway to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police who took up the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen can not yet be said.
Description of perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central Franconia after he had stuck the car away from all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride with his SUV over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has, according to his own statements, called on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This mainly concerns the waves of arrests, the freedom of the press and religion.
He had therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to become normal in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, then the rule of law is a very important prerequisite."
According to his own information, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan had then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to a building of flight readiness of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport at short notice.
Originally, it was supposed to take place on Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this by political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the successes of the negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober in terms of conditions.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's approval.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions during the UN general debate.
"The recent deadlock is that the US is building on coercive measures that are deadly to build confidence," Ri said in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat explained.
That sanctions could force North Korea on the "knee" is "a wishful dream of people who do not know us."
However, in order to build trust, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, the U.S. side had not responded to this, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone last year had adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict compliance with the sanctions in recent days with the United Nations.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang to discuss the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing from it: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet enchanted with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators already before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-part fridge out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from scratch: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so they all took part.
The result could be seen, the guests were excited.
"Better cooks can't do it either," praised a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put together," emphasized Father Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other tricks caused astonishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW of the board
Out of frustration at criticism from one's own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, gave up his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Table had introduced a stop for foreign nationals.
He had already resigned as vice-president of the NRW boards in July, Sartor said to the "World on Sunday."
I've got too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Grafel-Landesverband NRW, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to the dpa.
Sartor took the harsh criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why the Essen Table was doing that have expressed themselves."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday," Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
One should not take the approach, "without us the people of the city starve."
It was the responsibility of the state to ensure that people did not starve to death.
The Essener did not take part in a congress of tablets in Berlin on Friday.
"I'm told too much sweet pussy," he said.
There are all those social fuzzies that criticized me that way.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after Rück - Bettringen strikes Lauchheim clearly.

Gladbach playful tour twice - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
==References====External links==*Official website
==References====External links==*Official website
(sda) Four times in the first five league matches, Schalke has maneuvered himself into the other side with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again showed the strength with which it had placed the first place behind the Bavarians in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Yevgeni Konopljanka, and in consequence the hosts preserved the miniature cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is greeted by the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had reached a 0-2 setback against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to the 4-2 win in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63. minute, ensured the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break with another doublette in the final phase (86./94.).
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Against the Werder Bremen decimated already before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious entrance door that helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang didn't experience a complete success, but also no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave twice a lead out of their hands, played 2:2 in the end and are still waiting for an away victory in the VW city since 2003.

Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as was the second shot against him after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa shows up increasingly as a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase came from OGC Nice for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered itself against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable location.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season hit.After 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued his team: the 23-year-old Serb collected yellow-red after a jersey-upfer against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into play through a curious throw-in owner (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters back on Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0 sovereignly.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already set the home team on course using Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens today vote on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
In the event of a yes, the almost three decades of conflict with the neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future West integration.
The US had announced that if the referendum was positive, the country could quickly become a NATO member.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retired women and severely wounded them.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted on Friday at about 10 p.m. in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who went out with his fists on passers-by and tried to attack them for his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
The retired women were injured in some cases.
They suffered haematomas, bruises, and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown reasons, " as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yesword on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered life partnership was not possible for her.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals on 30 June 2017, Kahrs caused a stir with an angry speech.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having stumbled on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he meant in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Shabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Prior to that, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the law of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Bürgervereinigung Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leprakunde.
Because around 400 meters hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Citizens' Association.
And a lot of things have accumulated.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but luckily it's just a shape cut now.
Because already in the spring the hedge had already been shaved.
The breakfast always following the work has also a long tradition.
"Everyone should remain strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Canoeing World Championships
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the World Canoeing Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympic circuit.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympia bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the facility and it all worked out today," said the Olympic third of London in 2012.
At the finish, he threw away his paddle with joy and stretched both arms victoriously up - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't beat his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec was second in front of the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspection reported the first break-in attempt this fall into a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to take advantage of.
So yesterday the police inspection Gauting reported the first break-in attempt this autumn.
It is thanks to the alarm system that it remained at the family house on the Königswieser Straße.
It started when the perpetrators put on their hands just before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them to such an extent that they fled without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Break at Hertha: Overtaken by reality: Bavaria challenged against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: FC Bayern does not want to let the defeat in Berlin go.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dent under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase to the greater autumnal low for Munich.
"A week ago, we were invincible.
Now we've caught up with reality," said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0.2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Those who know us know that this is really annoying for us and that's why we're gasping on Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year abroad no own goal shot, like at the same time of the preseason two compulsory games in series without victory, the league leader in the Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg delivered two blueprints within three days with his intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside, as the last superpowerful Bavarians are to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we are not going to be pleased with this and that we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," stressed Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term of office a positive one before the international season break - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
===Benfica Lisbon===Kovac didn't take exceptional action before the second Grand Prix appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax begins as planned, which at the beginning of AEK Athens had also conquered confidently with 3-0.
"Now it caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost cup finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The right-wing defender acted as a reminder.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't do the variety of opportunities and make the mistakes behind," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were already behind Dortmund with five points, which has now again taken the lead with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich, with a wink, at least appreciated that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavarian has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces with grave accusations the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for interpretation sovereignty in the permanent issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the ex-World Champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the Causa in Mainz's ZDF "Sports Studio."
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan was not in favour of the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they had them photographed with me in England," Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
Honestly, as their president, I couldn't digest the fact that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photographs of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to present himself to players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - I can't do that.
"I regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, that's what I always said.
But he doesn't see a basis for Özil's return to the national team either.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer will now be appointed alongside the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone is clearly involved in society and football without a migration background and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it," Grindel said, it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration has to work."
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Championships and the Özil affair, he wants to run for office as DFB President again next year.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police reported, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange since the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had left the road and drove against a lead post.
In response, the man didn't want a local police force and then drove off.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has lost his way in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and has rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much more.
The damage amounts to about 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: still almost 1000 forces in operation.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehrgebiet in the Emsland, 980 forces are still busy with the fire work.
That's what the Bundeswehr told us on Sunday.
According to one speaker, as the situation continues to develop, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was declared a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark flight.
Thursday it was then said that an attack of the fire on neighbouring communities was no longer threatening.
At times, more than 1500 local forces tried to get the major fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehrtestgebie near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are planned again for the 2nd and 5th October.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the moor fire had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yesword on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper that a registered life partnership was not possible for her.
If we get married, it's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals on 30 June 2017, Kahrs caused a stir with an angry speech.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having stumbled on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he meant in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Shabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Prior to that, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the law of adoption.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state will be North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the neighbour Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote 'yes', they will also give the starting signal for their country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30th.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1986 dies in the USA in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, stresses SwissTransplant.
(dpa) This Monday Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available from Swisstransplant in case of need.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent, stresses SwissTransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor ID, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card will be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, relatives do not know the deceased's wish.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," so always.
There is already a similar registration system in the UK.
In Germany there are considerations to save information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as Marita Völker-Albert, spokesperson of the Federal Agency for Health Enlightenment, says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per or against organ donation -," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or his family disagreed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head calculation
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head calculation.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg he defeated 39 comrades.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, announced this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenceslas Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the eldest 74-year-old retired from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was there two years ago when he was 14 years old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or wunderkind, organizer Laue can hardly begin.
"Head calculation can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there were even stage-oriented computational competitions.
One of the disciplines is, for example, the square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also have good chances here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because in early childhood, head calculation is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows off her emotional and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer and make himself strong for early detection.
It's about life and death, but it's also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings upstairs without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands conceal their most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with early breast cancer detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
There were complications at the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes out her beds in the west for the first time next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists at the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week - snow could be snowing down in narrow valleys at a high intensity up to about 1,000 metres, it was said.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of Neuschnee can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual wrinkle care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual wrinkle care on Monday.
The "green ramparts" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the low-forest state for about 200 years.
The tree and bushes up to five meters wide are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as Ingo Ludwichowski, Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were established on the basis of an order of the Dane King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and livestock fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: By "Knicking" the branches could develop dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a spare habitat.
Up to 1800 species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds in one kilometer of knick.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Ludwichowski said that otherwise he would lose sight of a series of light trees, which in addition to biodiversity also loses the wind protection effect.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kneeling care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on the spot during the tsunamis?
No, I was in Jakarta on Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service has completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the inmates are partly free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provision on the island going?
Right now we have cell phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, of whom they don't know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi lying on the Pacific Fire Ring not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries to Werder: VfB has to forgo Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had a muscle fiber tear in the back left thigh at 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga player announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following international game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the film festival of San Sebastián, the series of the most prestigious European festivals closes annually.
Despite all the singing down to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching fire department tried to capture an injured duck.
The action, however, continued for some time.
Even a boat was deployed.
Olching - walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the waterwatch station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
The first attempts to capture the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman with a hearty grip after almost an hour.
The duck wounded at the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschleissheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard is targeting World Cup medal
==References====External links==*Official website
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up on the precious metal missed at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang's Olympic sprint the medal close to his grasp.
Seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze at the end.
"I consciously took time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a big event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you'll have to strike.
The World Cup trail in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I have already closed the track into the heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the past World Cup winter in Kontiolahti's (FIN) mass start competition.

Brett Kavanaugh: Turbotempo FBI investigation
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in turbo tempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the very thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial about allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline by Friday to clarify the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama of Kavanaugh's vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing with Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the jurist outburst angry Tiraden against the opposition democrats, the Senate's Justice Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative judge.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his initial announcement, declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the serious allegations on Thursday as "appearance," initially abstained from further attacks against women and spoke of "happiness in calamity."
In this way, he said, final doubts could be eliminated.
Later, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats at an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely narrowed down the powers of investigators.
One would specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, said one government representative to the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four Witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar of the municipality of Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle," is stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Bundesschulzentrum.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: The fear was felt
Trainers Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblauen had managed to bring the almost 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over the time and thus the first season victory under roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf had given security to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and pressing."With increasing playing time, obviously more and more the head played a role.
Don't actually create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours to me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand."
The guys were afraid to give it out of their hands and so they kept pulling back.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"A huge stone has fallen from everyone's heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the man's making."
But in the end only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest drawback of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed it, rather to worry for clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tattoo victory," Tedesco said, "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
So he wasn't the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke could not be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzach Valley observed a fire on Sunday around 1:30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon found out by the police and the fire department: An unknown man had burned garbage on a two square meter area on the Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed that he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the glow unattended.
And this is near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling and deleting.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
The author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani, stands in front of them.
He has again followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my job to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and one or the other joke, he brings one of the most conflicting topics closer to the listeners: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, first generation migrants sit at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one places oneself politically on the right or on the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first rather behaving, then the discussion round starts more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani is in front, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and a away victory.
Gießen won a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Mitteldeutscher BC.
The ambitious Bonners won the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
Alba Berlin is the first champion of the season after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern München and the former serial champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already made a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick tells you.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 properties that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
According to Frick, more than 100 applications were received.
"The documents are currently being checked" in terms of application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Mayor of Pliening, the goal is to have created the candidate ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
The award could then be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and paths will soon be paved.
A single property and two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable living space.
With a total of 16 income-oriented flats supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated is the area of the new building area Landsham-Süd housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the new construction of a day care center is taking place there.
It will accommodate three kindergarten and three nursery groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Thus Schalkes Naldo succeeds "great sport" also on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting team: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding with many people would have been great, if the almost two meter tall Brazilian had once really talked the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his pros, the 36-year-old, who is all simply called Naldo, turned on and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, had no resentment at all.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, knows that he didn't really get on the siding with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco told us about the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting team.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bavaria and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone is able to sniff through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which has recently also caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued its downward trend in August compared to the eurozone.
The purchasing manager index (PMI) stood at 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
Europe-wide, however, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit-Institut told on Monday about its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in a row below the 50-point mark indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The Greeks were final (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst is over," said Markit-Ökonom Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one brake on growth - at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have not fallen as much as since November 2011.
The companies therefore dismantled jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial enterprises.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are raised.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds eighth victory in the eighth league game
September 29, 2018 at 07:45 PM
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes further from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
==References====External links==* Official website* Official website* Official website* Official website* Official website
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and made the finals in the post-play time.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) provided for the 2-0 in the meantime.
Paris also won the general rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the season, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat this season at the 2:3 in Liverpool.
