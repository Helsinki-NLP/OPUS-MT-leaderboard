Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
But the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The deal about the Iranian nuclear program, promoted by Obama, has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu had given a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was partly regarded as an affront against Obama.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election in Israel at that time.
In an emergency call Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was, according to the authorities, in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Chief of Police Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police encircled him.
One day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and collaborators who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies towards problematic behaviour.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After escaping from campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in Pedagogy in spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy trying to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the female swarm back then.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the distress call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared at a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertaining coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were tidying up and joking together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialised in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vigil, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss his wife, but there is no indication that they ever got married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to recruit 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country. In the Christmas season of 2014, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and I gradually realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film "Back in Time."
The movie starts, and it comes to me that I am a simulated yawning and an arm length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "undisputedly the biggest time travel movie ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Shared Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
Eight polls showing Donald Trump to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it has (yet) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are starting to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey figures that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity readings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are kept in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" when Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they're "annoyed" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "excited" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one on enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "annoyed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to be Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he doesn't have the personality to perform his duties effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temper doesn't fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholars' hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, CNN/ORC polled last week says four out of ten that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beat almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they formed their minds.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little over half of the voters who support Trump say that they have firmly forgave their votes.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change your mind.
46 percent said they were leaving the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispano-Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the limelight, Donald Trump seems to be doing it.
The frustration about the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington, too.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "annoyed in hell."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a rooftop house costs 73,300 euros on average.
"The range of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations one square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top residential locations, however, the price is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter, of course.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich, for once, is not at the top.
Champions League: Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the Witch's Kettle of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's score (89.) earned 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Handkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
During his 28th match in the Champions League, Müller was kindly assisted by Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who had a shot of the World Champion as a flank.
"We won't underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm promised before the match at Karaiskakis Stadium 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus had won his youngest six home matches in the ruling class, including renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But the Bavarians, unconquered in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously approached, but often too inventive in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely made it against former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the upper left-hand corner.
In the 67th minute, the World Champion gave the possible 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
First of all, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown beat the Pole's headball off the line (26).
Then by direct removal, the goalkeeper Roberto parsed with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus could put needle stitches.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, however, was dependable.
For example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Prior to Neuer, Guardiola had a chain of four with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the squad, first sat outside.
The World Championship hero gave the green light only after finishing training, said Sports Director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, that's already malicious."
==References====External links==* Official website* Official website* Official website* Official website
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Müller put one on it by penalty.
Before the match, there had been riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially mummed Bayern fans in their spectator's block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured and transported out of the stadium.
Whoever smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
If you smoke, it will not only harm your lungs, but also your teeth - this is what a Potsdam long-term study suggests.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This can be seen from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely by 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gingival inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of caries.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to return to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Non-smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remnants of late antiquity on Cologne's banks of the Rhine
Again archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic Museum excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called land monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist office for archaeological land monument care.
In the third section of the Rhine boulevard the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it had already been known that a fortress stood in place in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured by freight train
After a young woman crashed at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the population for help.
On early Wednesday morning at about 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks coming from the direction of the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, by recording the train, she suffered the most serious injuries.
She was treated on-site and taken to a hospital by rescue personnel.
There is no evidence of the reason for the young woman's crossing of the track at night.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Local residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be obtained from the Federal Police's 24/7 hotline, which is free of charge, on the telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned TTIP Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which, in its operation, corresponds much more to traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system to which citizens trust," said the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swedish is planning to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedure specifically provide that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come equally from the EU, the US and third countries.
This is the first time a second instance has been planned.
It would allow us to object to judgments.
Up to now, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there has been no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, according to her own information, she wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS) demanded by large corporations in particular is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration tribunals are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can fight for damages to taxpayers, overturn national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the Commission's proposals as inadequate.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta), which has already been negotiated.
On the other hand, the German Secretary of State Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission took into account essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had prepared with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules would limit the scope for action by the economy.
This could put small and medium-sized enterprises in particular at a disadvantage, they said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) Free Trade Agreement can be concluded, remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be no longer valid.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost touched by Steven's talk.
He tells about different places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, about which his minute and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," cleverly composed songs appear, which blend harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor is that "Michigan" would be the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive certain expectations.
Stevens appears here in a reduced manner.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
In 2005, "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") released a masterpiece that was widely acclaimed.
Overflowing with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in any year's top list of influential music media.
After very productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic offsets on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and reverberation.
Long since the smaller clubs got off, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark held Hamburger More!
==References====External links==* Official website
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who has become much more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without saying a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad-enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture is "opulenter" and one can thus throw away the "record basically."
Only to an encore Stevens thanks modestly, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows down under thundering applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
The new Labour president, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and meet David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs close by.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it will come after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour president's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "had confessed in respectful silence" and that he had recognized the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen Shadow Ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, citing economic, defence and foreign policy differences, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation on winnings.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Labour and Pensions Minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman to face David Cameron, since he has been Tory's boss, over the Dispatch Box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that it will refrain from both "punishment" and conflicting with barbs and instead intends to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Minister of Economic Affairs, will represent him if he doesn't take part - for example when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the spokesperson of the Lower House, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theater," which is often linked to Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a cartoon and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': Homeless youth trained as photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and earn a living with it.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg ge (er-)) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless teenagers how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound jumped by data indicating an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses increased by 2.9% in the United Kingdom compared to the same period of the previous year.
Since 2009, this percentage has been the fastest and fastest estimate of the timing of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the takeover offer of the rival AB InBev was received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
According to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury Richemont, Burberry shares were 0.9% higher.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Glencore shares increased 5% after the mining giant said he had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had "sell" his assessment for the company Rating.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports expansion plans, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the Capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappy 21 years young, a wimp with a delicious haircut.
The guy with the platinum-blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going crazy.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
It's okay.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7am, however, the Polin sits on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here lives her idol, whose posters hang up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much a day as her mama Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "Actually, my Viktoria would have to be in tenth grade in high school."
"I am fulfilling her a dream."
Compulsory education?
Who cares?
The fans don't.
Even Bieber himself didn't.
He took care of it anyway.
For advertising in the Superbowl's commercial break, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pick company washed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're amazed at the window pane.
He's said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others point out that Bieber is finally ranked 1st in the US and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, does not interest the many zeros.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese on potato döner idea
Potatoes or döner?
Both are possible - in the potato döner developed by the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
On the idea, a poster brought him during a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cart Slippers instead of Döner," which he had happened to see on TV.
Since then, a barbecue skewer has been spinning in his shop, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has meanwhile been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authorities, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and potatoes the spear contains.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he says.
The culinary understanding of the peoples is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground-based campaign to combat Aldi Incident
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-based campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building up the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board with brands like ice cream manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA retail business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will take away around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and $250 million in Metcash by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million profit before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the Eastern states, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies around 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while simultaneously putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products every week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label food.
Metcash's Managing Director, Ian Morrice, says that price adjustments and retail renovation programs will grow in momentum and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is often referred to as "Special Ks," became the focus of the infamous confrontation between Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon afterwards, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted Richard Gasquet's potential US Open victory, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against the UK.
"One thing about which I am quite mature is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a racket when he lost a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break a racket of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man to return as a long-term integral part of the team."
"First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the ascent very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the limelight in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
For an unknown time, the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbian Foreign Minister said that it was "acceptable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage.
Talks must take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could agree.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the surprised Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that, eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions declared on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the arriving economic refugees are in search of a better life, rather than war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence built by the government along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher sentences for sentenced human traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military in procedural terms, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to force themselves into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders halved in national survey
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections (58 percent before), while Sanders ranks second, with 27 percent (increase of 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic electorate in the primary elections.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some profits.
Clinton has a big lead on women and moderates, but these advances have been reduced.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead on the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead on this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the primary elections nationwide say that if they were nominated by the party, they would enthusiastically support Clinton.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and a further 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of the primary democratic voters say they are enthusiastic about supporting Clinton, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Support for dealing with the problems and choice are also quoted.
As the vice president throws potential into the balance for the presidency, 57 percent of the democratic voters in the primary elections want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he shouldn't.
If democratic voters of the primary elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the election, but this figure of 78 percent dropped last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that considers him the "most selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters mention questions about electorality.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these electoral candidates stands out as unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results on some important features of voters in their party's primary elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best off on honesty with the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think so.
Democratic voters of the primary elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during her term as Foreign Minister continue to be asked, most Democratic voters in the primary elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this issue was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinion, although 36 percent said that her opinion of it had deteriorated.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this remains a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also regard Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades of leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders as more honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson joins Donald Trump in nationwide survey
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new survey, and others are dramatically losing ground
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide. Support is growing by 27% in the Tuesday survey of 23% in the last CBS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well received by demographic groups and that Trump is outnumbered among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been beaten down with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he is landing at 19% Republican support, behind which Trump has 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
In view of a Carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side strokes for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach holidaymakers to find still warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people don't go into the sea anymore: The German Weather Service (DWD) reports that the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week.
On the other hand, the Mediterranean continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic there are 25 degrees in the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a vicious ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said he had been blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out and supposedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said Chief of Police Wagner.
He couldn't be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso, and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has been dying of harassment every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and formation of a criminal organization.
"We want not only to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the house will be shaken, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long all this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession occurred within just 11 months of the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, albeit not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low a level to lead to the seismic shock many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical look at how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market saw last month, anticipation of interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency to choke off income 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after Fed's interest rate hikes.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market has been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to an increase in interest rates, rather flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six past cycles, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often promote it.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises its interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 have only been twice nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increases in interest rates with such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been prepared to raise Fed interest rates all year round, and all eyes were focused on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, Futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the cycles of increase from 1950 to the present have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and very quickly put pre-recession levels in the shade after the beginning of recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far this is 74 months.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stronger monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, loan margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as a rising dollar is making their products more expensive in the global market and financing their debts.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have surpassed enterprises with a weak balance sheet by 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debts are going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station for its "stupidity"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the station to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "dirty" and increasingly no longer to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dummy" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and music that's really unsurpassed.
"And I think Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that more work had to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that was fired during the hearing in the Committee for the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport for kicking commercial rivals on their feet.
Tory's deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "on a special BBC weise."
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit out of our own stable" when it launched a series of entertainment next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday slowed down spending in November
For over a decade virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, then this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IRRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now it's gonna settle down, and we're probably gonna see growth decrease.
The black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought over bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of 5 £ spending, slightly more than 1 £ was spent online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health also said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Great Mosque.
Those who mourned, largely dressed in white, filled the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The procession of mourning passed by the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the praying people.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family's construction company for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 prayers killed when a crane crashed through Mecca's Great Central Mosque were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already made a firm commitment that the Hadj to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Bin Laden group shouldn't have left the crane's arm when it wasn't used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden Group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company is forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that fell into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hadj, which will take place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not taking up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project run by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£ 174,000) be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount to permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British put down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls, nowadays you seem to be a minority.
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY jobs in their homes, says the company's boss behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at the lowest prices has now become obsolete.
Kingfisher is therefore planning to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, men predominate among the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends, with more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said, "There's still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decision to buy articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the top of a UK-listed FTSE100 index, has also redesigned her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball champion Aich/Dob were responsible for infidelity and tax evasion at the Klagenfurt Regional Court.
The defendants didn't plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was finally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to the Attorney General Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that between 2006 and 2011 the defendants used funds from association accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions, for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact was dismissed by the Chairman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later stage.
In order to reject the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had at no time suffered a disadvantage in terms of assets.
The sports functionaries had only offset expenses and led the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debts - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (around 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: do we continue the club or are we blocking it?" said one of the defendants, in the bread job, large-scale auditors of the tax office.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We shot money, put our life insurance as a security at the bank," he said at the time of the takeover.
It was agreed with the association: they can manage the money freely, only no debts may be made.
In addition, the payment of compensation for expenses had been decided retroactively until 1991 if the corresponding financial success had been achieved.
Therefore, some of the expenses were paid out only years later, from 2003, when a plus had been in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed bookings appeared, the former chairman explained the events.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payouts had not been disclosed to the club in detail.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial situation, only the debt-freeness was important, according to the answer.
When an official investigation into abuse began in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club's account.
That was reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and according to his statement was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge asked.
For a long time the respondent did not know the answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "damage compensation."
Why damages?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this wording because the club had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "You're all off the hook with that."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, he had only offset kilometer money and diets.
On diets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years could not be provided by the defendants.
They explained that they had not been kept after an audit in which everything had been judged to be correct.
The second defendant had also received kilometer money.
All corrections were made in cash, and he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23rd with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard takes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the personnel reduction that has been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The job cuts in the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The move would lead to a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which would be incurred from the fourth quarter onwards.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been ongoing for three years, is not yet complete.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still had around 302,000 employees.
The Hewlett-Packard share declined by 2.3 percent.
The large-scale printing group from Palo Alto, California, is currently breaking up: the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
The second largest PC manufacturer in the world, after Lenovo, has recently achieved a further disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.4 billion dollars.
This resulted in revenues falling in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a split-up and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only reacted late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-IS training mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would, however, be largely rejected: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent opposed.
The fact that other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is positive for 61 percent.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Collaboration with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of respondents, with 20 percent in favour.
29 percent couldn't decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The trade fair will focus on connected, self-propelled cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the organisers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed tear gas and water cannon at the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred displaced people.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border crossing point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it a police line had formed and behind the police there was a water cannon ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers started to use pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a bit.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees sagged in themselves and suffered from shortness of breath.
Serbian police spokesmen also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates have been raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half of them, who were of the opinion that the Fed would do so last week, now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed put interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance level, trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Death shooters at Delta State University left letters of apology
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleague the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it "does him sorry" at the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning
and said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency centre staff that the police had to send policemen to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but "no one will disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb didn't explain his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when policemen surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years as a "good man."
They were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "destruct on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been seeing Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb called relatives on Monday at a certain point in time to tell them "he doesn't go to prison."
When policemen caught him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his lure of life indicates on the University's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor also reportedly has to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa Rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major remodeling of the Group.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the approximately 1000 managers worldwide will be responsible for the restructuring of the Group's workforce.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and upgrading its subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment was a profit contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a Executive Board for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost line should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future in the Executive Board team headed by Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the reposition, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective dispute with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the court-announced strike on this Thursday.
That's what the union said.
The discussion will focus on the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible "in one year with a forecast record result."
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "wings."
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the Group's own low-cost Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-hand defender cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal doesn't give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery is now beginning, I will come back stronger."
Related to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never our players' intention to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it feels like, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It's one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, the environmental fable of Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or a message we've missed so far."
All well and well, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a summary of the film version of 2012, adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, but was completely unknown.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax movie, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the story of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is devastated by the greedy, tree-falling, Thneed knitting Onceler, despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a squatting, purring being "speaking in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokesman said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out a victory away.
Alastair Cooks page may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear any scars of 2012, just a teen-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth leaves the England test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
Long ago, the course of Lyth would have been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully if he hits out more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he didn't perform so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test-strike gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation you can make was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a hit man I highly appreciate.
He's an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us a lot.
He must have at least the same chances as those before him, but this obviously depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat up next to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, showed up, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a batter can't beat there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he's a hell of a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number three for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited relationship with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his stats - average 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there's no large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience, as he's played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I've always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the changing room can bring fresh air, even if the news is in line with what has been said before.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, isn't used in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team builders will not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not easily made in the heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy gets into a downturn by the year 2017
David Cameron's unbalanced renegotiating strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who fought hard because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always on their own, are fed up with Britain's own agenda of split concessions and disturbing treaty changes, which they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it didn't like them if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime ministers and finance ministers climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outside-looking UK inside the EU tent - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see through that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's prudent chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the excessively long-suffering ones like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It's hard to imagine that they're gonna pull out a leg to help the selfie brides whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan not to help, quite in the SNP style, during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bankruptcy" and "Great Britain did not gain any value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press baron, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can easily remember Boris Johnson, the Ore Euro opportunist, who made a name for himself as an "EU Straight Banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-nationals who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that if you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you'd better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum vortex, because Blair had put the principle on the unadopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need time for me to waste any more - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is in development - I say it kindly.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blush color tendency and the wilder areas of Tory's small-Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week when the Scout fought in him, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried on TV to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow MPs and MPs after all the reports at their closing session on Monday night.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even moved me - news discipline remains important around the clock in the age of TV and, above all, in the whirlpool of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free pass for Europe, which allows him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity of EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguity about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not start a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction in power by the Tory government, which I was reminded of when I launched on Monday by something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with connections to the tobacco industry.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Principle Report" last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE justified its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been convened to develop a model for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to synthesise their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was supposed to have received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they would receive funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding they reportedly claimed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the panel are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also specify industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco management of PHE.
The group's research work "confesses significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products to the most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been addressed.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small compared to this, but that we still have to study the long-term impact.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By providing clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in very controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC will commission or send programs that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidised rivals," Johnson told the Oberhaus Communications Committee in his study of the future of the BBC.
If you want to consider the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others don't do or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class window of time because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course, it's nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax fund could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both self-productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular shows of the BBC reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the more public niche programs should "go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they perform their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On broadcasting fees, Johnson said to the committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that you get a big value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, I wonder if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertain."
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example of this change in "information, education and entertainment" at the public television stations in Australia and Canada.
Regarding the issue of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on TV, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that provides electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms usually don't respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did if they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they switch on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The Ads Shame Britain's Arms Trade
Amnesty International anti-weapon trade fair video view.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle shattering leg cuffs!
Scatter bombs!
And electric batons that cause tormenting pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms show is a militant parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to blur weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the typefaces of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of gun dealers will travel with DLR... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of bus keys, which is claimed to have "access to about a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this Placatier "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trading posters greets the commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profitly with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the weapons fair - through a void of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising, but "by blushing in bright colors and animation it remains more sticky."
"They did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors expel fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army for "the AT4CS RS shot off from the shoulder."

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Dorms
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgettable 19-year-old, I moved to a student's dormitory, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to student dorms ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you are referring to Corbyn and why you "honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes got on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people alone.
People's rooms often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and communal meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and rearrange their underwear.
Related to this: Don't think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student dorms form a room-to-room-bum culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I've spent on interacting with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from socializing - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my student dorms had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you start the university at the peak of the back mania, knocking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to turn up asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Of course, the clutching of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are that they say they're using themselves, even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more in a more balanced way than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people away from sleep or work.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the proverb, you are one of the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind turning Drum & Bass down a bit, because it was three in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5:00 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she made her own music blasphemous, locked her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory?
On the other hand, it wouldn't be embarrassing if you held a roommate for your future spouse, took care of her, split up, and then have to see her every day and maybe see her pulling all her friends over to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk some sense to your abdomen.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between an elk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments before it becomes a boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door and place your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not place your possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Houses for refugees, single parents, low income
Real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who don't have much money in the central Franconian Eckental.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need living space, but also the single parent and the low-income worker."
"I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced to enter the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to create cheap housing quickly: he builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
Given the flow of refugees, we also need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
It's different when you put people in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
It took six months to build.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I did my project correctly under construction law.
Particularly complicated it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the parking regulations.
Creepy.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a terraced house need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you intensify the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It's true: We've had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single parent or the low earner.
I'll show you how to build cheap and good today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update."
When it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message indicating that the "software update failed."
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this less likely by slimming the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this when using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone might shut down halfway and this could lead to aborting the update.

You should also make sure that you have checked our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack."
Before the start of the seven decisive overseas races, the World Cup second emphasized that "I have nothing left to lose."
53 points separate the Vice World Champion from the defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton before the final race in Singapore this Sunday.
The British already won seven of the previous twelve season races and also competed in the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brit was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days a haze bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen," founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which was accepted by the chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to record chess players who cannot make the membership fee.
Youth work and the search for talent are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quartiersbüro seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consulting, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, to the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, from now on, senior citizens and people looking for advice will receive information on questions such as care insurance or the benefits of the health and care insurance companies.
For years, we have noticed with our outpatient care service that caregivers are often left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"It is also not uncommon that many of the cash registers are not used because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood," explained the new owner Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital and for the outpatient service "Amadeus" as head of the Altenhilfe division.
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional services such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The services offered by the Seniors Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, described "The Senior Care Center for Care and Care."
The reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city center is particularly due to demographic change.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized during the opening ceremonies, the district office also dedicates itself to the isolation in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering."
Thus, the Social Foundation makes a big contribution that senior citizens can live as independently as possible and well in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against third-party player Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was set as the date.
The match between Eintracht Bamberg and FC Würzburger Kickers in the 8th round of the Bavarian Football Totopokals was finally scheduled.
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 pm in the Fuchspark Stadium in Bamberg.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going on stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the pre-sale of tickets that has now been launched.
It's special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the last 16 teams, Eintracht Bamberg won 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) in 2010 and 1st FC Schweinfurt (3:2) at home.
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB club cup 2016/2017.

Viennese architect Karl Mang died 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as the broadcast said.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese accuses policewoman with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has noticed quite well in Bremen.
Once a footballer, Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, is now engaged, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have increased 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
But intellectually, he didn't do it.
Meadow just had its hair cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking room guard put out a parking ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Meadow then stormed out of business, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as reported by the "Picture" newspaper.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will be decided whether meadow is displayed, or not.
Authorities of Panama destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest-typical climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the growth of marijuana plants.
For three days now, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called on them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft filling station.
Three people also stayed on the site of the gas station.
One of these men shouted at the youth and punched him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a fracture of the nose and bled heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and talked to the thug, he left his victim at first.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car up to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male.
Using a baton, the victim's face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second racket is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to call on 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
The mayor of Samtgemeinde mayor Bernd Bormann, business promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be with his successor in the next few months with half a job.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstrasse 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and wants to join the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees it as an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the millers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the double family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as senior emergency physician in Diepholz County and is volunteering in the DRC's Bruchhausen-Vilsen district.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"The endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total grant of 50000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the velvet municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," stresses the mayor of Samtgemeinde, Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to Felstehausen every quarter, and in the North German average practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another family doctor's office.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller's practice takeover: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have left.
By the way, anyone who visits Müller's office hours continues to look above all into familiar faces: takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff from the Felstehausen.
With their farewell an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers smiling.
After a long time, she already feels a little woeful.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients many times," says the internist.
Her husband laughingly adds: "We have a 6000-square-meter plot."
"So far, I've always tried gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"The border controls are now also being lifted at our southern border," said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum can also make this "self-evident."
The care and safety of the people was in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia Considers Corridor - Slovenia Denies
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany, and that it might also set up corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the way Minister of the Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar saw it in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable" that Slovenia would step up border surveillance, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, however, Slowenin does not want to seal his borders for refugees.
"Every EU member has to fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system can't work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter Eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours on Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, ever since.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country will be reckoned with around 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday in agreement.
However, the Belgrade government denied that it was to instruct people to follow certain routes: "We can neither, nor will we do so," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and further buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometers away.
"We heard that Hungary was closing, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to a shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which had already been predicted by observers, to a somewhat more westerly route.
Croatia: "Encompassing opportunities for border control'
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-spendent member, has "encompassing opportunities for border control."
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this group since 2007, and the EU's partners have consistently provided the country with a good testimony on the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the Horgo border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It was not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to refugees maps showing alternative routes through Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area, there are still not cleared minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatian War.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners had been sent to the border region.
Stock exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwire and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information captured is said to have been insider dealing on the financial markets.
According to the investigators, this resulted in a total of more than $100 million.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught," says the SEC Communication.
The lawsuits against 32 other accused persons in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the US and from Eastern Europe.
ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz there is a busy operation.
People do their errands, sometimes quick steps, sometimes cozy strolling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Stop the trams.
Pulsating, pulsating life with wonderful autumn sunshine and four large tables in the middle of each with the headline "Before I die I want to"...
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Help drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action into the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions as well as for volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grabs the chalk and adds the phrase "yes to my life," "can read," "drive through the USA with the camper," "stop the war" or "do not suffer long," others stop short, read, say phrases like "so far I am not yet" and then go on.
Again and again small discussions about the action itself, about life, about how to deal with dying develop.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only when I realize that the end will come for me in this world at some point, can I live responsibly," says the director of the Deacon's work Mannheim, who together with the Caritas Association is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action for the 20-year-old was good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still taboo, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to opening up people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the subject through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the ecumenical hospice help sought volunteers by appeal, she immediately registered and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospice Sankt Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
"I see life from another wait, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of denomination.
The financial support of health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the vacation.
At this point in the past year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and become effective on 4 January and despite higher increases for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which will be charged from November onwards.
The company said that it still expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below $2.44 per share, which predicted twelve analysts surveyed by Zack's Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zack's analysts surveyed expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its Express shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transport sales increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher freight labour costs.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the ornate two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests before all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to get rid of the unprecedented incentive from the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - even if only by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the estate agent Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, what in itself makes the financial market unsure.
About half of the economists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised the sentences at that time," he said.
If it does, "it must go very far in its declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints from Liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expects an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed regards as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the 2% target of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world shrugged at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be pulling the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better control the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's currency authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint of the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "close" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited apparent impact on US growth," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability aspects first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Poznan, former member of the Bank of England's Interest Rate Board.
The recent turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are upset," said Poznan, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should go ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/stock is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and crockery, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash desks and has various pick-up options.
What's here: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallows, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and bile, pork natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash register.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own park area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small Life Aid for Refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 Lenzen.
Every Thursday, she does it at the asylum seeker's home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is completely different from a proper school.
Brazil's Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shock women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. It does so with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking at breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council of Bernried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The planning for the long-awaited gymnasium building at the Bernrieder sports grounds is progressing step by step: In the most recent municipal council meeting, the draft building proposal was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Previously, the board had decided, among other things, to apply for a building law "exception" or "liberation" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
According to this, a "Satteldach with non-center first and roof overhang" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderfully large south-facing roof," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which for energy reasons - unlike the construction plan prescribed - should be below ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was necessary because the development plan does not allow "exceptions" regarding the roof pitch - whereby the Bernried municipality council usually operates more restrictively in the case of liberation requests.
However, the gymnasium construction is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gymnasium building at the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are included in the costs.
Grants are expected from the promotion of school and grassroots sport.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted for examination to the Landratsamt.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, confirmed by the district councilwoman Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, the Supervisory Board makes a decision about this, and it will meet next Wednesday, September 23rd.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing Inner Station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot join in Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
The employees were informed about the plans.
The change resulted in the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play on the question of who should succeed, who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and to change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this meant in any case an "evaluation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "Inner Medicine," says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
Transitionally for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will run both houses until the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, in Peißenberg is to be finally closed next year after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at the hospital Weilheim has been completed.
Landratin Jochner-Weiß, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumours that the house, which is in possession of the Federal Shortage, should in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I'll rule it out." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-Weiß couldn't say that there are several considerations.
Currently there are a short-term care of the caritas and a day psychiatric hospital.
"What's better couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity won't come back," says Fischer about the quasi-movement to the Lech, which was received "positively and very understandingly" by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) was repeatedly threatened with closure in the past decades, departments were closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar lions are required at the Bergischer HC tonight (20.15).
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Badeners made a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were badly injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Aberntens on a corn field near Pratau (Wittenberg district), several hunters were in action, as the police reported.
After a gun fire, a 63-year-old and 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospitals.
At first, it was unclear how exactly the accident could have happened.
The detectives are investigating.
Missed 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violent Crimes
A suspect led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate who had been missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youth and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as the prosecutor and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, confessed the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had not come home as agreed on the evening before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered the victim's personal belongings.
When interviewed in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was finally a suspicion against the 20-year-old.
The suspected perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrested man admitted to the police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was supposed to be presented to the detention judge on Wednesday, and the investigators charged him with manslaughter.
Further investigations are to provide information on the circumstances of the case.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many big cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable homes.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Association for Social Housing.
For comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation.
Many then come across the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study is also a major failure in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that is growing year by year.
Currently about 770,000 housing units were missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in communal flat rooms.
Young adults involuntarily stayed longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the lull in the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a new start.
New incentives are expected to boost social housing.
Thus, property acquisition tax could be waived and the property tax on subsidised dwellings could be suspended for a limited period.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The programme for refugee accommodation of the state bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
On Monday evening, a good week after the start, with 184 million euros, more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had already been retrieved.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
There is virtually no way to get to Hungary, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
But the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to get to Western Europe from there.
500 people came across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws, which came into force on the same day, make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this purpose, the border strip has other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine cleaners should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closure of the border, hardly any refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people picked up.
Shortly before the end of the goal on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The convicted are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of which - 93 - were most important in Röszke's transition.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly.
On Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stayed there.
In practical terms, however, no one has the prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people have left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Locking grids were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria has reached only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
According to the government, however, about 20,000 migrants were still in the country.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the direction of German authorities.
In Freilassing smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "Gestrandete" across the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent with travel suitcases," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to get to Passau by train.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream, it was over for them in Wernstein," says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded people together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passau.
Before that, we ate the unexpected guests, with snacks and drinks.
We just said we'd take her by car to Passau.
"That was a matter of course for us," says Stadler in the OÖN talk.
You were very grateful.
A man could not afford to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try, after the short-term announcement, that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped, but still across the border.
However, the regional train was parked before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival associated with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday sociably, the day before a two-bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us more tens of thousands is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to establish structures that guarantee humanity in the Röszke camp, our Federal Chancellor has put the position of the Hungarian government in the dark of National Socialism in a highly official and public way.
This policy suffers not only from those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border regions.
The refugees will also have to find out that the "promised country" that invited them and welcomed them is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for protection seekers in our country.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winterproof quarters
Konrad has his hands full with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported about his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday had also taken place without much fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master achievement."
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation."
Altogether Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without floor," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the country's chiefs.
They would have assured him that he would also create quarters for the upcoming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow, there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Help as we do."
On the platform, individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Yesterday, Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high."
In times of emergency, it could not be that quarter encoders must maintain a certain height of towel holders or size of the skylights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
Konrad explains with his experience that he is more successful in housing than the Ministry of the Interior.
I'm an older gentleman who isn't easily told the falsehood to the face.
Convincing power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Their own accommodation search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to put up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seem to be problems with the permit.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is planning no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the people concerned can be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in the event of an emergency, further sites should be checked for their suitability.
The city chief criticizes the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed off"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday picked up the further approach to the refugee question.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany was still possible.
However, there is now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now again introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" from the German approach.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
On four of the six floors of the office and production building the listed IT group S&T has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us," says S&T boss Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies at the Neue Werft and acquiring them later.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - something Niederhauser is promising: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
S&T invested 1.7 million euros in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented out, for a further 40 percent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to delay this project in the pigeon market arcade: after all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, in which she sells, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from different manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening another store," says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also attracted by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who themselves have Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been brought into the cradle by her mother.
It's best for me if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women get caught up in rapture when they see a beautiful handbag, even the expert woman cannot answer with final certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
Some also associate this property with the billionaire who wants to become US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciters.
Whether he expresses himself hostile to others, confronts journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US President's Office is strongly inciting the election campaign.
And does a good job.
This is also registered in the Palatine Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire came from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer hairstyle is a term for many in the wine-growing village on the Wine Road.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is over a dozen corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they think it's kind of exciting, but they're not so impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which includes Trump as well as the ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the King of Hearts there.
Although there is respect for the family's performance, we also tend to think that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname that Kallstadt has in its surroundings, "The Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the bouncers, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the Showers.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a bar for gold diggers in the USA.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state of which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He didn't record Trump because he had left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatine History and Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared the film to be a film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."
This contrasts with the sometimes prominent statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as he padded, that's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump's ("The grandma was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he is always so excited."
Does he think Trump's gonna come?
"I can't imagine," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like many Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would be better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the USA had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Sarah Bühler, daughter of winemakers.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will mature even without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinemagoers, and in the United States, too, interest awakens.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first mountaineering village.
Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the vice-president of the German Alpine Association, received the 1800-inhabited village in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday the award for gentle tourism.
In Austria there are already 20 "Bergsteigerdörfer."
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain climbing village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made any major shifts in the ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with the presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television programmes, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance didn't seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained below last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise stands with an average of 349,000 spectators at 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking!
Written by TODAY on Monday, September 14 2015
The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decided to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a clear "yes."
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and slightly beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, resulted in an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot-Seat, an average of 620,000.
The decline in the odds of The Chase Australia's second evening will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million-dollar minute that didn't manage to outperform the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Unveiled mystery? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who won The Bachelor.
The woman who finally landed in The Bachelor was covered in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three girls left will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows the day before three two become, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women have left out in a lyrical way about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?" their answers could become the spoiler of the game, who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly - except themselves - called Mackay the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the ground, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week's house visit made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully committed to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a fight as the Aussie rugby league convert did at his first Punt return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a Punt and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his fucked-up catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pats at a Punt restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble cursing and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his Origin debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in-Goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss rights of gays
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested by force on a Siberian runway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized, and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free Voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW autumn class in Großwallstadt, party and factional leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools when there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get faults in the Bavarian education system."
The Free voters' parliamentary group will meet in the Lower Franconian municipality until Friday.
Actually, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course the subject of asylum will overlay the exam," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as was the case during the Yugoslavian wars in the 1990s.
"This is not the way it goes, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the Free Voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The head of the FW criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states."
"Bavaria is pulling off, others aren't."
"We need to be more capable of action."
But the state policy in Greater Wallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
In the new school year, Minister of Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the gymnasium intermediate level is tested from three to four years - as a result, it takes again nine years to reach the Abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The G9 issue must be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Harder Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market closed with profits after a long-distance directionless and nervous trading process.
It was only in the afternoon that a firmer start of the US stock exchanges made for a clear direction, which ultimately brought the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax average scored 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
The technology-driven TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the eurozone's leading index advanced by 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
The London and Paris trading venues also recorded solid profits.
In the USA, the Dow Jones index last recorded about 1 percent in plus.
Many Börsians expect that the markets will take their place this Friday until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also for the great decline on the future exchanges.
In the meantime, the discussion about the burdens from the nuclear phase-out has pushed the shares of RWE to a record low and also left deep traces on Eon.
According to "Spiegel," German energy companies may lack EUR 30 billion in reserves.
The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by a further 3.22 percent at the top of the Dax.
According to one dealer, a positive report from the US mooring magazine "Barron's" followed from the weekend.
According to this, investors paid too little attention to the German chip builder at the moment.
The investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year, as announced by the industry association Acea at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen benefits increased by 1.26 percent.
On the German pension market, the return on circulation of listed federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50 percent).
The Rex pension index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The federal future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The exchange rate of the euro last fell to 1.1262 dollars in the afternoon.
Around noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference price at 1,1305 (1,1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after policemen shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot her in the air before she pulled back on rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, known to be capable of killing but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th century.
The four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new Constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The plot at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the commercialization of the 4000-square-meter area.
A mixture of trade, trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter plot in direct proximity to the youth center Alte Post.
Preparations for this are under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, trade and housing.
Waiting for appropriate offers, it is said by the city.
The investor concerned is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts had yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / corner of Große Straße, already a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
For the first time, the investor publicly presented plans for the project.
A number of residents are still worried - fearing the sale of their leisure refuge
For months, negotiations had been held, raged, debated and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea are on the table near Emden.
The interested person, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau," presented his plans in public for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went off the offensive from the system construction management: "We don't have an answer to all the questions yet," he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The approximately ten to twelve million euro project has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details of the desired hotel building caused intense reactions among sea-boat owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the Meerbuden and member of the board at the interest representation of the residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is going to be a huge block that surpasses all other buildings."
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase considerably due to the intended size of the plant: "There must come entire bus loads to make sure that this pays off," says Schulz.
What happens exactly on the well-sized one-hectare area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First, we must have a coherent approach," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans are still variable.
Young twins at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased with its young gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet firm, as Mother Dian keeps them close to the body.
First, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center predicted on Tuesday a wide gravure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined gravure system in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the Miami-based weather experts.
Google Launches Double Donation Campaign to Earn $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a Doubling Donation Campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million on google.com/refugeererelief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also escape from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric hose formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI of those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained approximately the same among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% completely and 28% partially resolved diabetes.
In the medically treated group, the diabetes completely dissolved at only one percent and partly at only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol controls were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger decreases in the BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and had a more complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, in obese people undergoing obesity surgery, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love story plays in Hunsrück
It is a subject that is currently receiving more attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets after years the flock of her youth, and the latter falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually we're not like that" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel may be interesting especially for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Bordweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Bordweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accommodate all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis was admirable, but not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To care for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Ultimately, we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attack and pointed out that the U.S. violent reaction resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the incidence of hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and orange scent, which are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in toddlers, few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency center at Kansas University Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whiskey stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and if children get to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry - fragrant hand disinfectants at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an ER doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah sang her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth grade students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished her from her room.
The police regarded the failed plan as a "gossip" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a car crash on the cross-pin between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar towards the roundabout industrial area and realized too late that at the roundabout two preceding vehicles had stopped.
As a result, he crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The vehicle involved in the accident suffered material damage of about 10,000 euros, the police inform.
The 33-year-old Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.
Rumour kitchen: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays the disharmony talk down at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn that over again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson's accusation, and Warburton will be careful about January new commitments that could destroy the squad's unity.
Dons increase leadership via Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons created a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about disharmony
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates were not under increased control as they were preparing for confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don't think we're feeling pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutchman - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic since there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they no longer show climaxes of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of excitement in the old company games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, swear to Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic had to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen followed, which now clearly stood at the top of the table with five points ahead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because that makes players better.
Getting together now is so important.
Warburton careful on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new arrivals and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The ex-chief of Brentford said, "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea stormer Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts suspended on SFA Battle due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the red card of the defender was later lifted - the third red card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains in what he said and insists: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reproved after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Heart's player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding, "It's safe to say that I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admits that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're gonna get the boys back on their feet," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy to "win unsightly" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them a five-point lead ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in trophy games or leagues that haven't won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the National Statistics Office (ONS) figures showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunk people interfered with the process
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officers take the sturgeon into custody.
A breath alcohol test showed 0.89 permille in a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 permille and initially remained in custody.
Why I will be a witness of an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'm gonna sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionlessly.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you'll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could have "worded it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after a humid police chase persuaded to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy waters, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "gentle him to return to the shore. "
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday to a housewreck incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited about wetting his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and that he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt-topper sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back 18 months because of the espionage charges and didn't want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out all at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'm gonna have to figure out what I'm gonna do with my license.
Previously, Moody had launched the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an occupation in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly grab their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardlyly and maybe makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they're gonna have to take my license and break me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is gonna make them think about it.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he could "put his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the racing day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my collaborators mistakenly put mud on his leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, which was the case.
But it also had it on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here we have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver flight
The police arrested a man in Cobram on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and followed by a flight.
The cyclist was transferred to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries by helicopter after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway.
The police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driving flight and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy fights back against rivals for allegations of wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackling as "Agenda-Setting" of two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the Storm players "ringfights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the rugby league and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tactics and said that they were only focused on their "contact" during the tockling.
Bellamy added that the critics of two leading coaches on his team confidently agree with him, because it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the past six weeks, we've made our contact with tackles a real focus, and that's what the trend has turned out to be.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this keeps coming up at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was gonna take a shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build more trust because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means we're gonna meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-finals at AAMI Park the next Saturday night. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbians with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may be threatened with a life sentence for trying to take possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-long punishment for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escaping Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a bail of $200,000 as security together to reach his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two persons, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail under the conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police every day and adheres to a curfew of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus tears apart
A truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening in a three-car accident on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's cab of the causer of the accident tore apart completely.
The driver was taken to a hospital badly injured.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o'clock.
A damage of 122,000 euros was incurred.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, logging into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it, as it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "inspired to be a policeman to scare them."
State Attorney Elidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment of having taken indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, having violated the conditions on 25 January of this year and not having appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense Attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" is to be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Schleuser avoids small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken up away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
For fear of discovery and arrest, many smugglers increasingly left people at smaller border crossings
out on the Austrian side, said a spokesperson of the federal police.
Along the border river Inn more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration.
According to Federal police information, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the week beginning.
By 8:00 a.m. alone, around 700 people arrived in the capital, said a spokesman in the morning.
On Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city after the re-establishment of controls at the German-Austrian border.
Stuttgart: foothills of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm gusts in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) reported in Stuttgart.
The strong low is the foothill of the tropical storm "Henry," which has moved across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be expected until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance Circle.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again longer.
The crowd does it: Every two years the carmakers show their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, there was a particularly strong movement among compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA), this segment accounted for around 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (Public Days 17-27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand at the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
So that the volume model also sells well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive.
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, which also include three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only available as a five-doorer.
The second variant will be the combi, which can also be seen on the IAA in spring.
And what is going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA with new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door version in a conventional and a particularly sporty GT version.
He comes into the market early next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
The Nissan branch wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the brand's design line.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp on offer.
Suzuki Baleno: Suzuki Baleno, who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt, is also new in the segment.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
Sales of Baleno in Europe will start in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën branch put hand on the front: Here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified spotlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI will be added at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court was right for an ex-prisoner of the Tegel Penitentiary, who was housed in a cell too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were locked up in the rooms that are too narrow for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-convict with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated spatially.
Afterwards, the man, who according to his lawyer is now again at large, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability lawsuit for the unworthy conditions of imprisonment against the Land of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Court annulled the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for re-examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days' imprisonment from the period in question were decisive for the compensation, it was stated that a compensation claim was given.
Otherwise, "a deterioration of personal protection would be feared. "
The Chamber Court now has to settle the amount of the money compensation.
The Constitutional Courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
In April, they refused to pay compensation to a prisoner because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, human dignity is also the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet.
Furthermore, on Wednesday, Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which certified an unworthy accommodation for a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
For three months, the plaintiff was housed daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also hit the headlines over the past few weeks due to the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly included for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, even fights are said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of young talent, 19 are to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens in Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, and according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to receive one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this and we can do it."
The following overview gives an overview of what is going on in Germany.
According to different forecasts, apartments are used annually between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built to date (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing, however, is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: every year, between 60000 and 8000 social housing fall out of the fixed rental price, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable apartments.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from 518 million to one billion euros at the moment.
This is far too little from the Pestel Institute's point of view: 80 000 social housing should be created annually, and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year in support.
Scientists and Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be expected to work in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from the ban on working for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation, which restricted asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, the majority of people - also due to the shortage of skilled workers - have realised that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German skills.
So far, there is no sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most often mediated by personal contacts.
In Thränhardt's view, the construction of networks is therefore the Königsweg for work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to the daycare centers, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the daycare center, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
Should the need for female educators increase significantly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example, by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students without German skills are prepared for the lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who only have a qualification in German as second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state forbids asylum seekers or patient students to study - the only exception so far was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Student-willed refugees could be facilitated access to higher education.
Because refugees with a residence permit or tolerance no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Benefits Act when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not receive a Bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to the bafög.
Patienced refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this range will be reduced to 15 months.
But this funding gap also needs to be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes professional care of the newcomers.
Rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it some control.
This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to reside here, in Germany," he said on the Bavarian Radio.
He suggested translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more an issue for society as a whole than it is today.
This will also mean that the majority of society will have to change and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long been demanding and what international agreements such as the German Convention on Anti-racism oblige, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens use their possibilities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man-power and capacity, we can do it," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money had to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for health cards to be handed over to all arrivals at the same time as registering.
The benefits obtained could later be settled with the federal states.
In the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited service catalogue provided by the Asylum Service Act.
Otherwise, the doctors are mainly responsible for creating language barriers.
So far, according to the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde, migrants have been less well informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctor's offices, interpreter costs have to be covered, she demands.
However, many refugees would also be helpful with more general medical points of contact in emergency clinics.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there were significantly more untreated disabilities, and the young people were concerned with HIV education.
However, German doctors could understand the other symptoms from their education, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect," and as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even be able to see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and many refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practise, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take further examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.
A recently published study by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rate and death anxiety.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe frightfulness and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in social services, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, the majority of professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion," Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group under the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites to the manege on the brick wasen to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current maneuver staging.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important to us to get people away from their daily routine and take them away for two hours to a completely different world," emphasizes the 27-year-old junior director.
"Manegencocktail with a world city flair," that's what Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent movies, the Cuban duo wants to take it easy.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salmon alves, the acrobatics of Circus Probst also fascinates with sensitivity and jointiness.
Balancing with the unicycle on a bullet?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasises Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not well, we are not well either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
The "four - legged artist, " as they are lovingly called, is read from the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to get into the mange either.
So the first commandment is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in a enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances daily from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o'clock.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 17 o'clock the prices are reduced.
The animal show is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes false speech in parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also clouded by statements by opposition deputies that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with booing.
Last month they booed him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesperson Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their phones warning them against interfering with Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the affected Members of Parliament that immunity ends in Parliament and, once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
Later this year, HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and service activities.
The expected job cuts result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in moving to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers all over the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "will be focused on providing unmatched, integrated technology solutions to businesses," according to a company statement.
It is a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage is called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the move away from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation went according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and had then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded most of the injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will start his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger will set up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need to take a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite to move forward through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also undefeated after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It's never worked at Arsenal before.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign against a pathetic life) announced 2015 as the year of man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to master this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy moods," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halve the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our spiritual health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, luck really can't buy.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work but by his personality, which shone through interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of watching football in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone pastoral care explained to me:... "my listener role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status via the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you're visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why don't you take your friends with you for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here's the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player, who led the French champion on the way, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only seek the qualification for the knock-out rounds, but also an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances before the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start to win 2-0, cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we need to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't scored one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which could hold a 2:2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was knocked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing stormer was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, as he walked into Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmö's defense, he ended up nicely in the long corner of the net past Johan Wiland.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, competed at Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on himself, with some mispasses and bad qualifications, not least from Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five attempts, was alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had put him in after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a passport from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which Wiland passed by the post in the 52nd minute...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal in the season after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was knocked out of a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough."
Hat off from Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore Collects $2.5 Billion Through Share Sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is pushing demand and devastatingly affecting markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to repay around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The Company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city council in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arriving is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on September 25th and responds to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders had bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to engage constructively in areas of disagreement," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on their way to Washington before continuing to travel to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber-espionage and increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 HP sports cars rented and scrapped
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
With a company in Gotha County, you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 HP.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 at Arnstadt the dream was then over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into the sling on a wet roadway and drove into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
Property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented him from joining FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously close to the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times Club World Champion, two times European Champion, one time World Champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already on his way from Barcelona before the 2008 European Championships.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything back then, we won nothing," he says.
And this was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
As a reminder, in the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not come about.
And today the decisive man for this works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's season 2008/2009 would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood on the lawn for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against the Bavarians over the entire distance, switched off the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the King class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagonist in the chosen screenplay of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with offended disbelief and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the comments of the actor of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrlly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People supported the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights of the film; Damon replied that their director could "end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded with disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their variety - that's SO KNOW that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teen Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national impact and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox news personality Elisabeth Hassohneck whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The network Black Lives Matter is a love group," said the leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the Grand Prix of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finals.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned or lived more than $10,000," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
Leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, does not receive any prize money.
Under the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, he gets it with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, it gets the great gratuity.
I don't think he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone should beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to ascend in half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game in a very concentrated way.
The designated tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He swung the pickle well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at the (punch training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left fieldline.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful spot, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy ran over the wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated Rookie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who tore out a two-run from right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League that Plouffe beat a double play this season
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall created an RBI double against the Closer of the tiger Bruce Rondon and reached the 5-4 stand.
The right-handed man, however, stabbed Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit profited from an unmovable Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler after receiving the leadoff battery in the first place.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who made a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers increased in the second, scored a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose for the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliver right-handed A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to an injury to his shoulders.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, on the injured list since mid-August due to shoulder pull, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th
He's been missing since August 20th because of a tear in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.443 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in Wiesbaden will then be accommodated in emergency accommodations, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They are then to be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government headquarters responsible for the initial reception.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be an opportunity.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away."
Four years ago one was glad that the cup of military participation passed Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also demanded a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF that no one is being sent back to Hungary either.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she explained.
As to the question of an agreement under which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks on this subject between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September), the EU Interior Ministers intend to take a new start on the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee demand in Germany, the federal government wants to give more support to the countries in the initial reception and distribution of the people.
The federal government would manage this together with the Länder, Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultation with the Prime Minister at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel emphasized that those people who needed protection would also get it.
But anyone who does not have a view of staying in Germany could not stay in Germany either.
This view was clearly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "great effort."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometer-long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU, unlike Serbia.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary wanted to prevent tugs from seeking alternative routes via Romania to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
A global ocean swims under the Saturn moon Enceladus' ice tank.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the "Cassini" spacecraft.
According to this, the moon is slightly dangling on its orbit around the ring planet.
Although this tumbling movement is only small, it is still too large for a permanent celestial body, according to a message from Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus."
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturn moon, which spit water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, closed the astronomers back then.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up about a month on offensive actor Valdet Rama.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced rest. "
"It's hard for us, Rama is a bad loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said Sport Director Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an unifying professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously under contract with the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his ability."
Torjager Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player should start running training.
Okotie had injured his head in the match with Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash.
Contrary to first fears, however, he remained without a serious blessing.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their slender line are often advised not to do so.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy anyway: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
But a mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service UPS again hires up to 95000 helpers for the Christmas business in the U.S.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS reported on Tuesday.
Drivers are especially wanted.
Last year UPS had already increased its workforce by 95000 for the holiday season.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early arrangements since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had harshly criticized parcel services.
First blow dryer, then striking cold front
On the next night, the valleys of the north-Alpine side of the Föhn are breaking through, as Meteoschweiz reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and on the night of Thursday, the hair dryer partly blows through the valleys with storm strength.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing strong rainfalls, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive gravure area above the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the northern side of the Alps, on the night of Wednesday the hair dryer breaks through the valleys.
As a result, the hair dryer blows until Thursday morning in the valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km/h.
The hairdryer can penetrate into the neighbouring middle country, and on the mountains even hurricanes of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to jam on the southern slope of the Alps.
This is where rain starts, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, in the next 48 hours south of the Alps, it will have to be expected that some of the rain will be over 100 litres per square meter, after heavy rainfall has fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning the hair dryer leaves the air, followed by a cold front with strong, partly witty rain from west to east across Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshens up strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go down significantly.
The following days show up autumnally at 15 to 20 degrees Celsius in the north, while in the south it gets sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees Celsius.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a nameless square in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name had been applied for by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
On Wednesday, Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Community in Rome, recalled that the Protestants in the city of the popes could often live as a minority only in secret.
With the square it becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent a few months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time, he felt the city was a depraved crime beacon.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then begun the division of the Western church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer Artist Invested Three Years in Personal Interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has preserved his "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite bleak.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books."
The result is cycles devoted to themes such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments, or Our Father.
With this, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the scriptures selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated them into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old double allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"The education was already done with the cane," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this up, so that I may be able to get along with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to help art to become more important again in a fast-paced time: "The perception of image worlds today is marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being displaced.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the images, let them affect themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart."
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung to have been "ever" a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Old ones did not take care to fully comprehend the Bible, but chose the important, even mysterious, subjects for him.
"This was not a cooperation on an equal footing," says Altepost: "This is about the images, the text only explains." A picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "develop one's life and find freedom."
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX-Bahn nears
Plans made, found place, company commissioned, earth hills modeled for a circular course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn it was already over.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railways.
So hill deported, searched for new space - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The permission would be received in October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now inform on the children's and youth committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
It should then be started without a "further pause" with the work at the former indoor pool.
DFB Intensifies Commitment for Refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal on the weekend.
Soccer responds to the increasing situation in Germany and provides policy support in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"In principle, nobody can say that this is none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"That must interest everyone to get this topic under control," said DFB boss Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I will be in the chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs Özoğuz and the chancellor."
"The topic will surely play a central role there," he announced.
Soccer can and will help.
But the decisive course must be political.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach on the margins of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesliga players also support this program.
As early as this weekend, the 36 professionals will make a clear mark when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" instead of the usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler of the "Bild"-Zeitung (Tuesday) and described the project as "comprehensibility."
"The refugee drama is everyone's business, no one can look away."
"We football leagues can, no, we need to use our power, our influence and our ability to help the many refugees who have suffered so much," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
The women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualifying match against Hungary on this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community of German football."
The fact that all 36 licensing clubs had started their own projects in their locations is great.
Just as great is that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will each provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already retrieved the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
The Chief Executive Officer of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall at the beginning of July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, he fell on a water glass that he had worn in his left hand after midnight, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, passed out, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work."
In an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday Edition), McDermott announced that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ."
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since summer he has not been in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
To him it is important to go public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "Everyone can happen something like this."
"It's important to get up when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of combat...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
As a result, he can't be considered as a reserve driver for the two main drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in Singapore on weekends, as well as a week later at Japan's Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus vs. Krasnodar: Weidenfeller im Tor
With Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally shattered.
The national player will also be missing the champion of the Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 am/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we can't go back to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday."
Given the heavy strain of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal elf on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper's position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the soccer teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future.
He will also play the second match with a high probability.
Reus's forward statement that the final draw for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal is understandable to midfielder Julian Weigl: "This doesn't make Marco so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to get the title."
Robot cars: government wants to lead Germany
According to the Federal Government's will, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new mobility age" on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the IAA car fair.
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
A test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
In order to ensure that "no additional liability risks are imposed on the driver," the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and adapt it to the new developments where necessary."
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permitted speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to promote an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, and the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in a matter of seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected far after 2020."
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital connectivity of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey conducted by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dekra on Wednesday at the AA concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect this in 20 years, 31 percent don't believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, and 33 percent in the USA.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the Digital Association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to surrender control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, this could be thought to be 15 percent in running traffic, 45 percent in traffic jams.
Well, one in four wouldn't leave the car to control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to compete in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October only in singles.
The final decision should be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said Federal coach Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time on a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favourite," said individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was also missing, and we have become European Champion."
"We should be guided by this," explained the World Ranking Five.
Manchester United's English football player Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury on his right leg.
In the PSV Eindhoven Champions League game, the defender was hit in a Tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a shin fracture in the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wax figure horror cabinet: On Wednesday, designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich.
Highlights: mannequins that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who with Madonna's stage outfits became the great star of the fashion scene - and with that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which can be seen from 18 September in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a lucky thing that the fashion designer changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had already made a stop in Montreal and Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellently choreographed overall artwork for which a lot of effort has been done: For example, a stylist has been engaged to freeze the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers have carted 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He had always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer's first, timid fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
His parents wouldn't have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, I bought them, of course.
He couldn't pay the models for his first fashion show.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener lace as fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone does not work anymore today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Plauen Fashion Cup.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauen peak fashion played a greater role, was then replaced by the Heimtextilindustrie - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style epochs, creates an increasing job potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and Embroidery.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years about 80 percent of sales have broken away.
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade are almost no longer available.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way anymore.
Today, the mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, the export, currently to Russia and the USA, weakens.
So there are sufficient reasons for new paths.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the embroidery bead in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch office of the Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
A field of tension arises between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, who have to think above all economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine embroiders small beads in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krausse was inspired by this: "Before that I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in and around Plauen and who want a memento.
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen lace.
Disney plans new Mary Poppins movie
Legends shouldn't be touched, but Disney dares to make a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins."
According to "Entertainment Weekly," this is not about a remake, but about a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magical nanny.
It is about the experiences of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy more widely to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group that was tasked with steering the reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access rules, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital intake, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Within the framework of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened up for private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predatory fish
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus to give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, strongly criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of missed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and young children," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt from Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the neurotoxin for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons."
However, large predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury that, on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unfor saleable.
In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, described this as a "trick," because smaller Friedfish, such as carp, are usually so low burdened that they already comply with the planned maximum levels.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion that alone helps the economy," explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which accumulates strongly through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause particularly in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system."
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, explains on its homepage that a "health risk to the general population" is not to be expected in view of the current maximum levels.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion.
According to written information from the Federal Ministry for the Environment, the German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year to members of the Green Parliament Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "persistently and comprehensively exceeded," the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF warning system.
