This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot deliver, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal on the top was chestnut brown and on the underside was light or carotinoid.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called Rachis, but have other characteristics of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the Rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature control or for heart control. The researchers assumed that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and no chicks down.
One car bomb detonated yesterday morning in the police headquarters of the Turkish Gaziantep, killed two policemen and wounded more than twenty people.

The police said that they suspect a militant follower of Daesh (ISIL) behind the attack.
They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: It was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
In order to determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma flow, the luminosity and rotation are taken into account together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the poles of the magnetic field.

The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts attractions to the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and put a printed sheet of paper on which the candidate of their choice is registered in an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates may send representatives who attend each part of the process as witnesses. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Her first was the slalom, in which she won a "Did not Finish" in her first race. 36 of the 116 participants achieved the same result in this race.
Her other race, the giant slalom, ended with 10th place in the women's group with a combined runtime of 4:41.30. She was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers of crutch skiing did not come to the finish, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom could not place themselves in the race.
Madhya Pradesh's police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police President Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants had appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered significant injuries to the head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services liberated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya was charged with murder of her son before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody until the indictment and trial, but eyewitness statements may be falsified as her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when you publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is the lead in law enforcement, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians demand that the borders be restored to the state before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley of ten years from the signing of the agreement, but the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
Protectors of the accompanying pest control test should be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Managing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training lessons.
Martelly signed a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martello's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the country's governance package for new elections.
The Commission was Martello's response to the widespread dissident protests that began in October.
The cause of the partly violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
More than 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people have suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that he was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
"Last week, the METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious"."
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable."
The earthquake rocked Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Civil Protection Office said that no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had declared that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by abducting her bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved and there are at least six confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an older lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
He trained as a maternity doctor and began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work in the hospital, Liggins began to examine premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the pulmonary maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, the government's investigators recovered two "Black Box" flight recorders.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels gave the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was ... maybe even more crazy ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 election campaign, the temporary Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, declared that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want Elisabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games was to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the disciplines 100 m and 200 m freestyle as well as in three layers, but because of his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was unable to take the medication needed to overcome his pain as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people confirmed the discovery by means of different hardware and software in early February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can make proteins and make life possible.
As comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, the scientists promise to gain insights into how planets, especially the Earth, emerge.
Cuomo (53) took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize the same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and sillyness."
It is speculated that he could apply for the office of President in 2016.
NextGen is a system the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be provided and the above-ground trains will not stop in Wembley. On-site parking or park-and-ride facilities are not available.
With the concern for lack of transport possibilities, the probability grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published in Science magazine on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had developed within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwinfink, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrated cactus fink, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn to a thin wire that can be turned and braided. It can be hammered or rolled to leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. Red cabbage juice can be used to produce an indicator.
The cabbage juice changes its color, depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which their electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powder together and then form it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a sink toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses that visited men and women in mixed society.
If you call someone who's thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was transported by a rocket into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and gaze a little.
It takes a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It brought us the railroad, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are cats of medium size that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are many small cats (including wildly stray domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each cat has and which ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called pack.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and boys.
Women usually have a close relationship when living in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion pack act similar to wolf or dog pack, animals that are surprisingly similar to the lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior and are just as deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump large distances and pull with the fivefold force of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (type Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase of grumpy roared words.
Ozelots eat small animals. If they can, they exploit monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than himself.
Scientists think that ocelotes pursue and detect animals for eating (prey) with their sense of smell. They sniff at where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots hunt their prey by visually matching their surroundings and then falling on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g. when they move over a mountain range or river or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adjustments to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
With time, the new population is beginning to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen, inhale people, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food through the sun through photosynthesis. They also donate shades.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. We feed mainly on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other Mosaics.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal crossing its path.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue, feeding on turtles, big fish, other Mosaics, and perhaps even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not up to him.
While most of their food might be known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called the Seven Sleepers.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to hold common banquets where they lay on their side while eating their meals.
Ancient Rome's dishes could not contain food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no old Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of God.
They offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to conform to the will of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called Zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops simply consisted of shop counters open to the street. Stone was used for building the house.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse legends it is said that Erik the Red was banished for murder from Iceland. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Legacy of the Templars," you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "original declaration of independence, dated 4 July 1776." The text is located upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows with certainty who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of his life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a marking.
The landing on D-Day and the ensuing battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"He was ruled by the "Vichy" French, which were French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civil, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizens, and civitas, which means city or city state and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical testimonies and fail to be recognized as veritable civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the federal treaty, which consisted only of Congress.
The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, he relied on the state authorities, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all of his laws.
He also had no power to suspend tax laws and duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team together with the German national football team is the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motorsports.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan, Japan is geographically often referred to as "archipelago."
Taiwan's beginning dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the grain cultivation methods of the natives and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan to be the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the first Chinese-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
Up to 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most widely used still image format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the prevailing film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but even more important is that its image format has been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format is confusingly 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the easiest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The often mocked and often mocked third rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains a measure of order in a picture.
It says that the intersection point of the lines that make an image vertical and horizontal third is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs states that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that for this very reason the funds of the churches are available.
The central power of the Church was in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was met.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a sea blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective as it divided the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated the universally recognized international law codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sea sections, which posed a threat to even neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to join the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book with poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different ages. Every period of time in China and every family in power was its own dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties there were also unstable times of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the epoch of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a turning away from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also after the revolution, all occupations were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and the best could appeal.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class membership, the army rankings were now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Cheops Pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built in the third century BC by the Egyptians, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built for the worship of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or the Gizeh Necropole in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples as well as the great Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheop's wives and family members.
The "Stroke" symbol looks like a V and the "Stroke" symbol looks like a bracket or a square where the bottom line is missing.
Uphill means you should start at the top and push the bow. Downhill means you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The brushing usually generates a softer sound, while the brushing is stronger and more expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed sheet marks are there for musical reasons, which is why they should normally be respected.
King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, panicked her two little children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women in Versailles on 6 October 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob of people who made threats against the king and the queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of their carriages.
Eventually, a member of the enraged crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the appalled queen.
The war expenses of the U.S. imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of spending, and interest on bonds flowed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street's banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits that came from the continued exploitation of the Philippine people represented the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The epoch in which events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an age in European history that extends over the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The early Middle Ages preceded the high Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which ended in agreement around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human fate is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
It can be said, for example, that the development of roads is inevitable for the passenger car.
However, a nationwide road network is economically not viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new health care techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that drew on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is the geography that formed individuals. In time, customs and cultures arose with reference to this geography and these, as they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily controlled laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
At that time the title of the fashion capital of the world also wandered from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th century.
At the beginning the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began using buttons to fix clothes.
The need economy is agriculture, which aims to produce just so many foods that it meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, crop that has been stored up, uses native seeds in the ecoregion and combines them with changing fields or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers have operated subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, place and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their affiliation by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children were held captive by people (usually their parents); in some cases the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the considerable intellectual or physical limitations of the child."
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before being exposed or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised completely by animals, the wild child shows behaviors (within the scope of his physical possibilities) that are almost completely in accordance with those of his specific foster animal, such as his fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, "scaffolding" goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that supports individuals in a novel learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little paper clipper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is integrated into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to cope with alone.
Children are housed in foster families for a variety of reasons, for various reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the system of care accommodation is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster family system is designed to provide a secure home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The care center should cover all the needs they had not received in the home from which they were taken out before.
The Internet combines both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "consistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of microexpressions, a few milliseconds of facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that you can see if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in the facial expression.x
In his article The President's speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who can no longer understand language due to brain damage can still properly assess the honesty of people.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these variations expressed from the pool.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as the human to meet its need for amino acid from available plant sources.
Moreover, it has serious consequences if one fails to do so: depression of growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal sources of food (adults, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep offset is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without completely awakening you.
If you are someone who introduces the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluid before going to bed (especially water or tea known for its diuretic effect) so you are forced to get up for urinating.
The measure of inner calm that a person possesses correlates in the opposite way with the measure of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute rest and satisfaction.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been extended to include the path of Mahayana's love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is on the yoga of the gods. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the end of the war, the clash of systems, course and culture caused the countries to become hostile.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last for the next 40 years and, in reality, be carried out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Polish defense had already collapsed completely and the only hope was a retreat and a repositioning along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The mission of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. Americans tried to bring workers and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Great Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated in the Zāgros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals in order to easily come to their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds wandering on hills or other pastures. The goats were cared for by shepherds of goats, similar to the more famous shepherds; often they were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, production tracks were built in England.
Although the conveyor tracks were only made of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and to carry larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Early on, thresholds were introduced to secure the position of the rails. However, the realization that rails carrying a belt of iron were more efficient gradually prevailed.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of movement was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (which means "righteous man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go up so regularly.
Two-footed species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment, but if you don't just want temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
After his approval by Congress on July 4, a handwritten design signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, known today as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Court of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which had it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap wide pages that still exist are the oldest still existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs who have survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use the computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that it is not immediately possible to make a diagnosis.
The best sign of swallowing poisoning can be the presence of an open container containing drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for this special poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term is derived from the age-old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are very adaptable to parasitizing people.
Both predatory bugs and bedbugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or housing their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to fall ill with MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenthood.
The main goal of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific studies.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and carrying out observations.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all science issues, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of the body's own cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Behaviours determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that even in the absence of external signals perform free-waving cycles for a time.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the key evidences that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to incorporate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation involved, the importance of the piece of genetic material in question, and whether the cells concerned are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Near-natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their workplace and are passed by others whose job is in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting, all are, in some ways, connected and supported by a transport system based on the private car.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought out the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.x
In developed countries, you will rarely hear a similar number of complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such maladministration, why do they fail every day? Are road engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions taking place between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, as one cannot predict driver behavior with 100% safety.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently, so traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be mathematically roughly represented.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roadway installations.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find efficient food and sex partners.
Most insects can fold back their wings along their bodies.
As a result, they have a wider range of small shelters where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and day-to-day flies are the only insects that can't fold back their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), was moving around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river on earth. It runs more than eight times as water as the second largest stream.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, some up to six miles wide.
A total of 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans through the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon river is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the Giza pyramids were never exceeded in their size and technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Empire marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, since they can all be found in their original form in nature and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four aggregate states (in the same order): determined, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also set up the theory that they are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe in its entirety consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, after his invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has come into the background, so that it has been pushed back in its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a sharpener.
You can be curious what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
About as if you were rolling a heavy car up a hill. If the core is split again, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate even with little or no impulse.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called a crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side there could be more Mary, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to ascend to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their surroundings make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of demand hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, carrying out performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and taking employees into duty.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and makes everything their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often leads to divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led according to the same excellence standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be taken into account by local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
"The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x"
Why would an organisation take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organisation? One goal for the practical implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge if all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization.
As a result, the joint work of an organisation in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process of responding to the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organisations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Thus, they limit the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumors affect the behaviour and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies enable us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent machine adaptation.
Research in the field of AI includes the manufacture of machines for the automation of tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples are control, the setting up of strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, the AI system is widely used in business, medicine, engineering and military and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not seldom would a teacher like to bring her students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, Bennet School students in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing skills. Although students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blog experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
The blogging "must also force the students to learn more about the world around them." The need to awaken the interest of the audience inspires the students to write wisely and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far beyond traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; through the active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of the texts of others and set out their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's enchanting bilingual capital and is characterized by a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further to the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the untouched beauty of nature spreads in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and others characterize Ontario as what is considered by outsiders to be typically Canadian.
Large areas further to the north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as wildlife is concerned, its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belonging to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and in the Comoros and Mayotte it was very successful.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married regardless of their actual marital status.
Also the wearing of a ring is helpful (only none that looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an attack, and that it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when you reject men, and do not shy away from defending your point of view (cultural differences back or forth; that does not mean that it is okay!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century before the beginning of the Common Era and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to give it up after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who set up commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole spectrum of tinnef are sold, but this is all for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside Gomas should be carefully planned to know the state of the fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short drive.x
This in combination with its relative inaccessibility has made "Timbaktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction and has an airport due to its reputation, it is now an impoverished city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates PBS specializing in "Wonders of the African World."
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab rather than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entry fees.
It can also be worth buying a Wild Card that grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar chart that is visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely crowded on newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place the British colonists have made their own. If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, one third of which is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal king tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart all day from the cross-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most of the buses leaving, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are driven by small Japanese coaster buses that are cozy and stable.x
Gathering taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is an inclined rope bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 metres high, its length is 378 metres and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 metres.
The passage height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the clearance for traffic was not completed until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017. Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited today's East Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also operated subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of native tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived hunting, collecting and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly called the Grand Province of West India, was created in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on Las Cañitas Polofeldern.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.x
Information on competitions and sales outlets for polo tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is determined in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and on Stanley credit cards. US Dollars are also often accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, but British and US currency can be accepted; inquire in advance with the owners about which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is there summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced rain or dry seasons: The rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park see the sight of humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yard/meter from bears and wolves and 25 yard/meter from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful Bisons, Wapitis, Elk, Bears and practically all big animals can work, it can happen that they pass to the attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wild animals. So avoid carrying or cooking strongly fragrant foods with you, and watch out for a clean warehouse.
Apia is the capital of Samoa on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s in the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland extends over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (North Harbour) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing opportunities and most offer shades donated by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One." It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
You can drink the local tap water without hesitation, but if you are worried, you will also find easily bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of coffee "Flat White" is foreign. A small black one is "Espresso," cappuccino is filled high with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Dice squalls occur near the beach and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They may occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveler the certainty that after his arrival at the destination he has a place to stay.
Travel agencies often have deals with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as tents, through a travel agency.x
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also hold back your reservation for you if you need time to rethink the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. Visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most of the visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that music is still played on parts of the festival until late in the night, even if the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking ice causes quite terrible noise for the most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually try hard to keep guests on site for as long as possible and spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests cheerful and to make sure they stay.
Some playgrounds offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. Drunkness, however, impairs judgment, and all good players understand how important it is to stay sober.
If you want to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads the adhesion is low and you cannot drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
In the case of snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or floating snow or condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues throughout the year for the most part continuously.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari refers to a country trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can watch them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a hike that takes either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other places throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Olympic summer games after being hosted in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March most cancellation policies due to the Corona virus did not apply until July 2020 for which the Olympic Games were planned.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, an average ticket about 7,000¥.
Ironing wet clothes can help with drying. Many hotels lend iron and ironing board, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hairdryer if there is one.
Be careful that the substance does not get too hot (this may cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various procedures for cleaning water, some of which prove to be more effective to counteract certain hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Vermin can destroy food, cause irritation, or at worst even cause allergic reactions, administer poisons, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals, which can hurt or kill people by force, are usually not classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers with a high level of taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on Highway Buffalo-Pittsburgh is probably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you will remain mindful: steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp curves prevail here.
The specified speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, mobile coverage is much better here than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery products are quite delicious. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as at the southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are widespread, with apples cooked to pastries all year round and cherries and plums used in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich baked goods, try what is called Berliner, Pancakes or Craps depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "humid" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is usually used in curries; coconut milk is usually used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that includes a wide variety of regional cuisine that can be found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without any additional attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now spread all over the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. As a flavor bearer, the Javanese prefer peanuts, chillis, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
Stirrers are aids for the riders' feet hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may be caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and catches his foot on the stirrup, he can be dragged along when the horse goes through. In order to keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps that allow a stirrup strap to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world always discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and drive down a slope over a snow-covered underground.
Skiing is a popular activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "skipenner," who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a certain place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of the ski slope as a sport date back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first leisure club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski hiking with backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It resembles alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include it, as the latter are executed in steep terrain and require much firmer skiing and boots.
Consider the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you are able to travel a little longer than hiking - very rarely you will reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-kept trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for visas several times and go through several passport checks if you want to travel through several countries.
However, the Schengen area is a bit like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross borders without having to re-enter the passport control system.
Accordingly, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen Member States individually with a Schengen visa, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no generally valid definition of which items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called "antique," although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of Sámi's livelihood, and the culture around trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Also in the past, not all Sámi have bred reindeer in a large style, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like. Reindeer considered them mainly as migratory animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Even if the term "gypsies" is widely used by non-Roma, it is often seen as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel notice is issued for the country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than yours, but their references are tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Discussions are merely a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and too simplistic compared to the more detailed information to be found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disturbances or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of weather that depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water pants and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal storms include blizzards, snow storms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly warned to pay attention to any kind of storms affecting their territory, as this may affect all travel plans.
Anyone who plans to travel a country considered a war zone should do a professional training for it.
"An Internet search for "Course on hostile environments" will probably show the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing games, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning a gender-matching operation abroad must ensure that they have valid identity documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unstated gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender is different.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The searches on security controls have also become much more intrusive in the period after 11 September 2001.
Transgender people prior to their operation should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact while passing the scanners.
Riss flows are the returning stream of waves broken on the beach, often in reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a rapid flow up to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't get caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon period is not so pronounced), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to another culture and abandoned some behaviors of your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers had to adapt in a new country.
It may not be expected that returning travelers will need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the Pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it's still before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The story of sounds and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, illuminating the various pyramids.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, which is bordered by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula pass here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth mountains, which is divided into two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outside and in a clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as expeditions that require data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people who plan to take a year off are study and course offers abroad.
This is particularly popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before the university without compromising their studies.
In many cases, participation in a foreign bridge year program can actually improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
As a general rule, a tuition fee is charged for the registration of these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
For the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even if the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for each yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, one in six or eight has a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while you return in the evening and spend the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore during the on-board excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer in their brochures Berlin in Germany as a destination. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flight travel can be a frightening experience for people of any age and from any sphere of life, especially when they have never flown or experienced a traumatic experience.
For this one must not be ashamed: this is nothing but the personal fears and antipathies that have a lot of people.
Learn more about the functioning of aircraft and the operations during a flight can help some overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of having no control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often time is a very important factor for company documents, commercial goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies difficulties occurred.
When they shipped things via air freight, the unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines' regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come into play.
The obvious way to fly into First or Business Class is to turn a big batty of money for the privilege (or, even better, get your own company to cover the costs).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect that you will have to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business and eleven times the first class!
In general, it is pointless to search for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of airplanes who are willing to pay a lot of money and demand appropriate prices for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Kischinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port to Istanbul and a very good traffic hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive and bustling business centre located on a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red brick roofs, the market from the 18th century as well as old mosques and churches, although the city radiates an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some graves.
It is worth strolling around the fascinating village for half an hour.
In the north and in the immediate vicinity lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron had described its splendor in bright colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Visit also in the north the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima - a place that is world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave site as well as a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many others with relatives who were murdered there or who worked to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not negotiate the site by applying or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and as well as anyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only given in Catalan, as they are legally the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements are made in the metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an incorrect cliché, it is best to find your way around Paris if you show yourself from your best side and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-educated), which will make it much easier to get along.
The harsh exterior of the Parisians disappears very quickly when you show basic manners.
The Plitwitzer Seen National Park is heavily wooded, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, various soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkably large variety of plant societies.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats and grouse, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach over their knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are wrappers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colours, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear pants that reach over their knees.
Also these can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men there is a one size!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like that in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any just available ingredient such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"Apart from the word you for "you," all nouns always start with a capital letter, also in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, but writing is rather difficult because you have to determine whether a tutorial or property word is used as the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the subsequent vowel.
"Take care to say r and rr differently: caro means "love," whereas carro means "stretch car."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to better understand formulations.
Of course, when you speak a Romance language, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish could quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't have to learn it extra.
Today, premodern observatories are no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution during its high phase did not pose the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Looking at cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum flowers were the flower of choice.
In Japan the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other nobles in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove "only one" specimen."
If you visit a formal garden and collect "samples," you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can find your way around and buy almost everything after arrival.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to reckon with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses northward to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, tours of the castle in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also represent popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions around the festival have been adopted by non-believers throughout the world in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is the tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening, during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations of the congregations often beginning at midnight, during which the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or bathing.
Because of the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans entered the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the Polar Night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the northern light, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and the light pollution is often no problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits belong to the usual business clothes and colleagues address themselves with their surnames or job names.
Harmony at the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than praise for individual performance.
Workers often have to obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to comply unconditionally with the instructions of their bosses.
